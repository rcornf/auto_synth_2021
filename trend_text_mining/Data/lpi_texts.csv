0,669,Synchrony in Svalbard reindeer population dynamics,"We examined potential synchrony in the growth rates of three Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) populations and tested whether this pattern may result from correlated environmental variation. Two neighbouring populations had synchronized dynamics during the study period, while a more distant population showed different temporal variation. Climatic forcing (the Moran effect) was a likely synchronizing mechanism in combination with contrasting density-dependence patterns between the synchronous and asynchronous populations. Local climate was a more important synchronizing agent than a regional climate index (the Arctic Oscillation). Nevertheless, our results also suggest that variation in climate at a large scale may be important. Based on indirect measurements of dispersal/migration, our findings indicate that this factor does not play a key role in the spatial synchrony of Svalbard reindeer population dynamics."
1,2987,Density-Dependent Spillover from a Marine Reserve: Long-Term Evidence,"Spillover, the net export of adult fish, is one mechanism by which no-take marine reserves may eventually have a positive influence on adjacent fisheries. Although evidence for spillover has increased recently, mechanisms inducing movement of adult fish from reserve to fished areas are poorly understood. While density-dependent export is a reasonable expectation, given that density of fish targeted by fisheries should increase over time inside well-protected no-take reserves, no study to date has demonstrated development of the process. This study provides evidence consistent with density-dependent export of a planktivorous reef fish, Naso vlamingii, from a small no-take reserve (protected for 20 years) at Apo Island, Philippines. Mean density of N. vlamingii increased threefold inside the reserve between 1983 and 2003. Density approached an asymptote inside the reserve after 15-20 years of protection. Modal size in the reserve increased from 35 to 45 cm total length (TL) over 20 years of protection. In addition, both density and modal size increased outside the reserve close to (200-300 m), but not farther from (300-500 m), the reserve boundary over the 20 years of reserve protection. Movement of adult N. vlamingii across the boundaries of the reserve was rare. Aggressive interactions among adult N. vlamingii were significantly higher (by 3.7 times) inside than outside the reserve. This suggests that density-dependent interactions were more intense inside the reserve. When interacting adults differed in size, the larger individual usually chased away the smaller one. Furthermore, the mean size of adult fish captured by experimental fishing decreased from 35-cm TL 50-100 m outside the boundary, to 32-cm TL 250-300 m outside the boundary. This represents some of the best evidence available for density-dependent home-range relocation of fish from a no-take reserve. "
2,2352,"Rapid population declines of Himalayan Griffon Gyps himalayensis in Upper Mustang, Nepal","The population collapse of resident Gyps vulture species in South Asia, caused by the use of a veterinary drug diclofenac, has highlighted an urgent need to monitor numbers of other vulture species in the region. This study assessed population trends of Himalayan Griffon Gyps himalayensis in the mountainous region of Upper Mustang, Nepal, which is an important breeding area for the species. Vultures were surveyed in 2002, 2004 and 2005 by recording the number of birds sighted along 188 km of transects, and observing numbers of birds at breeding colonies. The number of birds recorded per day and per kilometre of transect declined by 67% and 70% respectively over the period of study. The number of active nests declined by 84% from 2002 to 2005. The veterinary drug diclofenac was available in pharmacies in the Mustang region. Young Himalayan Griffons, which migrate to the lowland areas of Nepal and, in increasing numbers to India, are highly likely to be subject to diclofenac poisoning. If this rate of population decline occurs throughout the Himalayan region, the conservation status of the species will need to be urgently reassessed. "
3,4246,Conservation and Population Recovery of Gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) in Nepal,"The remnant populations of Gharials, Gavialis gangeticus, are now confined to the large, deep rivers of northern India and Nepal. In lowland Nepal, the populations are restricted to a few stretches of the Narayani-Rapti and Karnali-Babai river systems. Periodic censuses of the wild populations have been made over the past 12 yr. Here, we present population trends of Gharials in the Narayani, Rapti, and Babai rivers based on these surveys. The results indicate that the combined numbers of adults and subadults have been gradually increasing since 2005, but the numbers of adults are low and female biased, with very few males recorded from all study sites. In 1978, Nepal established a captive breeding center in Chitwan National Park, from which captive-bred animals have been periodically released 4-7 yr after hatching, at which time the animals are about 1.5 m total length. The detection of hatchlings and subadult classes that are smaller than these released animals in the rivers indicates that there is natural recruitment. Therefore, collecting all nests for ex-situ breeding might not be the best strategy until more rigorous field assessments are completed to determine the relative contributions of captive-bred versus natural recruitment. We suggest that more effort should be channeled toward field assessments, including mapping and monitoring habitat availability, habitat management to ensure necessary environmental flows to create sand banks and deep pools, and research to better understand the ecology and behavior of Gharials in Nepal's rivers."
4,1742,"Population status of North American green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris","North American green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris, was petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The two questions that need to be answered when considering an ESA listing are; (1) Is the entity a species under the ESA and if so (2) is the ""species"" in danger of extinction or likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range? Green sturgeon genetic analyses showed strong differentiation between northern and southern populations, and therefore, the species was divided into Northern and Southern Distinct Population Segments (DPSs). The Northern DPS includes populations in the Rogue, Klamath-Trinity, and Eel rivers, while the Southern DPS only includes a single population in the Sacramento River. The principal risk factors for green sturgeon include loss of spawning habitat, harvest, and entrainment. The Northern DPS is not considered to be in danger of extinction or likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future. The loss of spawning habitat is not large enough to threaten this DPS, although the Eel River has been severely impacted by sedimentation due to poor land use practices and floods. The two main spawning populations in the Rogue and Klamath-Trinity rivers occupy separate basins reducing the potential for loss of the DPS through catastrophic events. Harvest has been substantially reduced and green sturgeon in this DPS do not face substantial entrainment loss. However there are significant concerns due to lack of information, flow and temperature issues, and habitat degradation. The Southern DPS is considered likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future. Green sturgeon in this DPS are concentrated into one spawning area outside of their natural habitat in the Sacramento River, making them vulnerable to catastrophic extinction. Green sturgeon spawning areas have been lost from the area above Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River and Oroville Dam on the Feather River. Entrainment of individuals into water diversion projects is an additional source of risk, and the large decline in numbers of green sturgeon entrained since 1986 causes additional concern. "
5,3490,Analysis of Atlantic bluefin tuna catches from the last Tonnara in the Mediterranean Sea: 1993-2010,"In the last 20 years, several factors have heavily impacted the Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery. They include management policies, market changes, the ban of the drift-net fishery, expansion of the modern purse seine fleet, and implementation of a stock recovery plan. To enhance current knowledge about the population's status, we conducted a long-term analysis (1993-2010) of scientific data and standardized catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) from the traditional trap fishery of Sardinia (Western Mediterranean, Italy), which is the last active bluefin trap fishery in the Mediterranean. We detected a significant increase of the standardized CPUE and a significant decrease in mean weight over time. Cluster analysis conducted on 29,000 specimens revealed three different size groups that were distinct by time period: the 1993-1995 period was characterized by a significant presence of large bluefin; a decrease in mean weight occurred in the 1996-2006 period; and 2007-2010 was characterized by the prevalence of young adults in the history in the trap fishery. This trend, which needs to be confirmed over longer time and spatial scales, raises some ecological questions. In particular, is the occurrence of these young adults a consequence of changes in the migratory behavior of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean, or does it reflect the actual demography of this population? The results of this study emphasize that data from traditional traps provide valuable long term scientific information about population parameters through time, and thus the use of traps as monitoring stations should continue in the future.

6,4616,Coastal Fish Monitoring in Baltic Reference Areas 2000,"The fifth annual report on monitoring of Baltic coastal fish presents the development and dissimilarity over time compared to the first years catches of the fish communities in six international reference areas; Kvädöfjärden at the Swedish coast of the Baltic Proper, Hiiumaa in the Estonian Sea of Straits, Brunskär in the Archipelago Sea, Finbo at north-western Åland, Holmöarna in the northern Quark and Råneå in the Bothnian Bay, and one regional reference area, Curonian Lagoon in Lithuania. Year-class strength of female perch and the development of reproduction indexes of viviparous blenny are also discussed. Dissimilarity patterns of the fish communities were not found tobe similar among the reference areas. A significant increase of the dissimilarity index was found at Brunskär reference area and a significant decrease was found at Holmöarna reference area. The increase at Brunskär indicated enhanced eutrophication and the decrease in Holmöarna was caused by strong year-classes in the beginning of the monitoring period. Instable fish communities appeared at Curonian Lagoon and Råneå reference areas, the former probably as a result of improved control of anthropogenic effluent to the lagoon and the latter probably as a result of natural environmental variations such as temperature, currents and weather conditions.  Year-class strength showed a similar annual variation pattern in the south-western archipelago of Finland, Åland archipelago and northern Quark. The pattern deviated at the other areas, except that year-class 1988 was strong in all areas. Indications of improved reproduction of viviparous blenny were found in Kvädöfjärden, Finbo and Holmöarna reference area. ; "
7,3620,Ecological and life history traits of Hemiodus orthonops in the invasion process: looking for clues at home,"The understanding of the environmental preferences and life history of a species in its native range provides insights for assessing its potential success in a novel area. Hemiodus orthonops is a migratory fish from the Paraguay and Middle Paraná rivers that invaded the Upper Paraná River through a fish pass, constructed in 2002. The invasion of this fish was analyzed based on habitat attributes and its life history in the native range and in the novel habitats. The native and novel habitats presented similar features. The population showed exponential growth in the years following the invasion, with relevant alterations in somatic growth, proportions of items in the diet, and in reproductive investment. The successful invasion appears to be related to similarities in water chemistry and habitat types between the native and novel range and the species' high dispersion ability. The species also showed earlier maturation and use of poor quality, but highly available feeding resources. Comparing life histories there was indication of a trade-off between investment in reproduction and somatic growth, with an increase in the latter in the novel habitats. In addition, the reproductive investment was more associated with offspring survival (oocyte size) than fecundity."
8,3608,"Observation of an invasion of the piranha Serrasalmus marginatus Valenciennes, 1847 (Osteichthyes, Serrasalmidae) into the Upper Paraná River, Brazil","The building of Itaipu Dam, 150 km downstream from Sete Quedas Falls, resulted in the natural geographical barrier drowning, with subsequent mixing of the fish faunas. Serrasalmus marginatus (Osteichthyes, Serrasalmidae), a species that had been restricted to the river segment downstream from Sete Quedas, invaded the Upper Paraná River. The catching of Serrasalmus spilopleura, a resident species, decreased drastically after the invasion, contrary to S. marginatus, which increased in abundance. In the Piquiri River, where the latter species does not occur, the abundance of S. spilopleura remained high, due to the presence of Nhá Bárbara and Apertado Falls."
9,4136,,"Sharks have been important as seafood source and fisheries revenue in Cuba. Nevertheless, current information about this group of fishes in Cuba is scarce and in the last decades they have not been the focus of any organized research. From October 2009 to June 2011, fisheries and biological (229 sharks examined) data were collected at four landing sites in the northwest of Cuba. At present, there is no organized fishery specifically targeting only sharks along the northwest coast of Cuba, but they are caught as a component of multispecies fisheries on the insular shelf and as bycatch in longline fisheries targeting billfishes. We registered a total of 17 species, six in the commercial fishery, dominated by Carcharhinus perezii, Sphyrna mokarran, and Carcharhinus leucas, and 14 in the sport fishery (i.e., small-scale artisanal, not recreational properly), dominated by Isurus oxyrinchus, Isurus paucus, Carcharhinus longimanus, Carcharhinus falciformis, Galeocerdo cuvier and Prionace glauca. Mean CPUE by months in sport fishing varied from 0.43 to 4.44 number of sharks caught per ten fishing trips. Most oceanic sharks caught in the Cuban sport fisheries are highly migratory species and their populations show great ecological connectivity throughout the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent waters. This fact and the presence of a high proportion of individuals of C. longimanus and C. falciformis below maturity size are important results to be considered for regional conservation of sharks and planning rational use of shark fisheries."
10,4028,Monitoring the status and trends of tropical forest terrestrial vertebrate communities from camera trap data: a tool for conservation,"Reducing the loss of biodiversity is key to ensure the future well being of the planet. Indicators to measure the state of biodiversity should come from primary data that are collected using consistent field methods across several sites, longitudinal, and derived using sound statistical methods that correct for observation/detection bias. In this paper we analyze camera trap data collected between 2008 and 2012 at a site in Costa Rica (Volcan Barva transect) as part of an ongoing tropical forest global monitoring network (Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring Network). We estimated occupancy dynamics for 13 species of mammals, using a hierarchical modeling approach. We calculated detection-corrected species richness and the Wildlife Picture Index, a promising new indicator derived from camera trap data that measures changes in biodiversity from the occupancy estimates of individual species. Our results show that 3 out of 13 species showed significant declines in occupancy over 5 years (lowland paca, Central American agouti, nine-banded armadillo). We hypothesize that hunting, competition and/or increased predation for paca and agouti might explain these patterns. Species richness and the Wildlife Picture Index are relatively stable at the site, but small herbivores that are hunted showed a decline in diversity of about 25%. We demonstrate the usefulness of longitudinal camera trap deployments coupled with modern statistical methods and advocate for the use of this approach in monitoring and developing global and national indicators for biodiversity change."
11,3554,"Decadal trends in abundance, size and condition of Antarctic toothfish in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, 1972-2011","We report the analyses of a dataset spanning 39 years of near-annual fishing for Dissostichus mawsoni in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, 1972-2011. Data on total length, condition and catch per unit effort (CPUE) were derived from the > 5500 fish caught, the large majority of which were measured, tagged and released. Contrary to expectation, the length frequency of the McMurdo Sound catch was dominated by fish in the upper two-thirds of the overall distribution exhibited in the industrial catch for the Ross Sea shelf. Fish length and condition increased from the early 1970s to the early 1990s and then decreased. Fish length positively correlated with Ross Sea ice extent in early spring, a relationship possibly caused by more ice encouraging larger fish to move farther south over the shelf and into the study area. Fish condition positively correlated with the amount of open water in the Ross Sea during the previous summer (Feb), perhaps reflecting greater availability of prey with the higher productivity that more open water brings. Decreasing fish size corresponds to the onset of the fishery, which targets the large individuals. CPUE was constant through 2001 and then decreased dramatically. We hypothesize that this decrease is related to the industrial fishery, which began in the 1996-97 austral summer, and concentrates effort over the ice-free Ross Sea continental slope. As a result of limited prey choices and close coupling among mesopredators of the region, Antarctic toothfish included, the fishery appears to be dramatically altering the trophic structure of the Ross Sea. "
12,1497,Geographic Structure of the Adelie Penguin Populations: Overlap in Colony-Specific Foraging Areas,"In an investigation of the factors leading to geographic structuring among Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) populations, we studied the size and overlap of colony-specific foraging areas within an isolated cluster of colonies. The study area, in the southwestern Ross Sea, included one large and three smaller colonies, ranging in size from 3900 to 135000 nesting pairs, clustered on Ross and Beaufort Islands. We used triangulation of radio signals from transmitters attached to breeding penguins to determine foraging locations and to define colony-specific foraging areas during the chick-provisioning period of four breeding seasons, 1997-2000. Colony populations (nesting pairs) were determined using aerial photography just after egg-laying; reproductive success was estimated by comparing ground counts of chicks fledged to the number of breeding pairs apparent in aerial photos. Foraging-trip duration, meal size, and adult body mass were estimated using RFID (radio frequency identification) tags and an automated reader and weighbridge. Chick growth was assessed by weekly weighing. We related the following variables to colony size: foraging distance, area, and duration; reproductive success; chick meal size and growth rate; and seasonal variation in adult body mass. We found that penguins foraged closest to their respective colonies, particularly at the smaller colonies. However, as the season progressed, foraging distance, duration, and area increased noticeably, especially at the largest colony. The foraging areas of the smaller colonies overlapped broadly, but very little foraging area overlap existed between the large colony and the smaller colonies, even though the foraging area of the large colony was well within range of the smaller colonies. Instead, the foraging areas of the smaller colonies shifted as that of the large colony grew. Colony size was not related to chick meal size, chick growth, or parental body mass. This differed from the year previous to the study, when foraging trips of the large colony were very long, parents lost mass, and chick meals were smaller. In light of existing data on prey abundance in neritic waters in Antarctica suggesting that krill are relatively evenly distributed and in high abundance in the Southern Ross Sea, we conclude that penguins depleted or changed the availability of their prey, that the degree of alteration was a function of colony size, and that the large colony affected the location (and perhaps ultimately the size) of foraging areas for the smaller colonies. It appears, therefore, that foraging dynamics play a role in the geographic structuring of colonies in this species. "
13,1897,"Distribution and status of the smooth-coated otter Lutra perspicillata in National Chambal Sanctuary, India","The distribution and relative density of smooth-coated otters Lutra perspicillata Geoffroy were studied along a 425 km stretch of Chambal river within the National Chambal Sanctuary, Central India, between 1988 and 1992. Sample sites of 1 km were surveyed every 5 km. The study revealed that the distribution of otters along the river is patchy and largely restricted to the upper reaches. During the 1988 survey, 36% of sites were found with otter signs but only 24% in 1992. Recent increases in disturbance along the river due to construction of road bridges and mining activities might have put pressure on the population. Most of the positive sites (66%) were found on rocky banks, followed by clay banks (19%), banks with shoreline vegetation and marsh (11%) and sandy banks (3%). During intensive monitoring of four radio-implanted otters, c. 78% locations were made on rocky banks, 19% on banks with shoreline vegetation and marsh, with lt 3% on sandy banks and lt 1% on clay banks, indicating greater preference for rocky banks owing to the greater availability of den sites. As a conservation measure, monitoring of the otter population should be done regularly and restrictions on cultivation, grazing and mining along the banks should be imposed within the Sanctuary limits, especially in the identified stretches."
14,980,Bald Ibis Geronticus-Eremita Population in Turkey - an Evaluation of the Captive Breeding Project for Reintroduction,"This paper reports on captive and wild populations of the bald ibis Geronticus eremita in Birecik, Turkey. Captive breeding and reintroduction, aimed at increasing the wild population, are evaluated. Low breeding success in captivity, failure of reintroduced birds to join the wild population in migration, and losses during migration and in the winter appear as major factors preventing an increase in this population. Probable causes of these three factors are discussed. "
15,3852,Global population status of shy albatross and an assessment of colony-specific trends and drivers,"Context Monitoring the status of albatross populations and identifying the factors driving observed trends remain international conservation and management priorities. The shy albatross is endemic to Australia and breeds only on three Tasmanian islands. Aims To provide a reliable total population estimate for shy albatross, including an assessment of demographic trends for each of the three populations where possible. We consider also key drivers of population trends for each population, particularly the potential role of fisheries by-catch, with an overall aim of determining the status of the species. Methods Aerial photography and ground surveys were used to estimate the number of annual breeding pairs and trends in adult and juvenile survival rates were calculated using markrecapture methods. At-sea distribution data was used to identify population specific trends in the overlap of shy albatross and fisheries to evaluate the potential influence of fisheries by-catch on the populations. Key Results The Albatross Island population increased post-harvesting but has recently stabilised at around 5200 breeding pairs, less than half its estimated historic size. This trajectory change appears driven by a decrease in juvenile survival. The small (170 breeding pairs) Pedra Branca population has recently declined, probably due to reduced breeding success associated with the increasing population of Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) on the island. The largest population (on Mewstone) comprises at least 9500 breeding pairs. Trends for this population are unknown. However, this paper demonstrates that these birds have greater overlap with trawl and longline fishing effort and are consequently at higher risk of fishing-related mortality. Conclusions Given the extent of fisheries overlap, survival rates for Mewstone individuals are likely to be lower than the Albatross Island population. Combined with recent trends on Pedra Branca and Albatross Island, we suggest that the current status of the shy albatross is likely to be stable at best and quite possibly decreasing. Implications The concerns raised about the conservation status of shy albatross reinforce the importance of continued population monitoring focussed particularly on establishing the trend of Mewstone. A thorough assessment of interactions with trawl fishing operations also is a management priority for this species. "
16,3334,"Distribution, abundance, and status of the Greater Sage-grouse, Centrocercus urophasianus, in Canada","We reviewed the historic and present distribution of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in Canada and found that the species has been eliminated from approximately 90% of its estimated historic distribution. Sage-grouse have been extirpated from British Columbia and reduced to remnant populations in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Estimates of the size of the population decline in Canada range from 66 to 92% over the last 30 years based on currently occupied habitat. As a result, sage grouse have been listed as Endangered in both Alberta and Saskatchewan by provincial governments and federally in Canada by COSEWIC. Intensive surveys from 1994 to 1999 in both provinces suggest that the 1999 spring breeding population had declined to between 813 and 1204 individuals. The number of active lek sites has continued to decline, suggesting that some habitats have become unsuitable to support viable sage-grouse populations. Number of yearling males recruiting to leks each spring has been low, suggesting that production and overwinter survival of young are the major problems related to the decline. Low chick survival rate, with only 18% surviving to 50 days of age, is the most likely parameter contributing to the population decline. These declines could be related to one or any combination of habitat changes, livestock grazing pressure, oil and gas developments, or climate change, all of which could lead to increased predation rates and decreased survival. It is questionable if the present population of sage-grouse in Canada is large enough to remain viable."
17,1746,"The African savannah elephant population in Kidepo Valley National Park, Uganda: changes in size and structure from 1967 to 2000 ","The age and sex structure of the elephant population in Kidepo Valley National Park were studied using recognition files. Moreover, population trends were reviewed using past studies. From 1967 to 2000, the elephant population varied between 200 and 500 individuals. Of the minimum number of 374 elephants found to use the Park, 352 were individually identified. Seventy-nine per cent of these were recorded in 29 families ranging from three to 22 animals with a mean group size of ten. Young animals dominated the population (45% aged 0-9.9 years), while 11% were 10-14.9 years of age and only 18% over 25 years of age. Overall, males constituted 45% of the population, but only 32% of the individuals in the 10-14.9-year age class were males. Individuals ≥15 years of age displayed a skewed sex ratio of 1:1.4 in favour of females. The extent of skew was greatest among mature animals (≥25 years of age), which had four times as many females as males. The skewed age structure in the year 2000 caused by poaching and drought, led to a significant difference between the age distribution in 1970 and 2000. Recent counts suggest that the Kidepo elephant population may be increasing. "
18,4503,Coral loss and fish guild stability on a Caribbean coral reef: 1974–2000,"Data on reef substrate composition and fish guild structure was extracted from filmed underwater surveys conducted in 1974 and 2000 at a coral reef in the Florida Keys. During the course of this 26-year interval the reef underwent a dramatic (>75 %) loss of stony coral cover, particularly acroporids, accompanied by significant increases in turf algae, crustose-coralline algae, octocorals, and macroalgae. At the same time, marked changes occurred in the structure of a guild of large herbivorous reef fishes. Total abundance declined, and the relative abundance of constituent species and functional groups changed as well. In contrast, we recorded no change in any measure of structural stability in either of two carnivorous fish guilds (lutjanids, haemulids) that feed by night in off-reef habitats. These results are generally consistent with the hypothesis that coral loss differentially impacts functionally dissimilar groups of fishes, according to dependency on reef substrates for food and/or shelter. The persistence of sizeable herbivore populations along with the relatively low (<16 %) macroalgal cover seen in 2000 suggests that coral loss at our study site was most likely due to bleaching and disease, rather than a response to macroalgal overgrowth. This study represents the first (and only) known study that simultaneously quantifies both a “phase-shift” in reef substrate as well as concurrent changes in the structure of a reef fish assemblage at a single coral reef in the tropical western Atlantic region."
19,2358,Monitoring population abundance of the sand lizard Acanthodactylus scutellatus and their ant prey in oil-polluted soils of Kuwait's Greater Al-Burgan oil fields,"Desert ecosystems in Al-Burgan oil fields of Kuwait were contaminated by heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons due to oil spill generated by the Gulf War in 1990. Studying sand lizard (Acanthodactylus scutellatus) population and their ant prey in the years 2002 and 2003 to detect the effects of oil pollution is now a focus of study. Polluted sites with apparently different degrees of pollution (namely tar mat, soot and clear sites) were compared with control sites outside this region. Total lizard numbers were recorded by using transect method. Number of ants was recorded by walking the transects and counting ants present. The results showed no difference in lizard population between the different study sites in 2002 and 2003 by applying the transect method. No difference in ant populations between the different study sites in 2002 and 2003. Although, the mean estimated lizard numbers were lower at the tar mat sites, the ant number in this location was greatest, meaning that food availability was highest at these sites. This suggests any reduction in the numbers of lizards is unrelated to low resource availability. The lizard numbers at the tar mat sites could be depressed by some property of the pollutants. "
20,1673,Female-biased sex ratios in subarctic common frogs,"In vertebrates with genetic sex determination, large deviations from the 1:1 sex ratio at the population level are rare and demand an explanation. We investigated adult sex-ratio variation of common frogs Rana temporaria in two subarctic breeding ponds over a 6-year (1999-2004) period using capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods. Using the same data, we also tested for the occurrence of the biannual breeding cycle in female common frogs and sought evidence for population size decline. Sex ratios were highly female biased in both populations: on average, only about 30% of breeding individuals were males. CMR analyses further suggested that the female-biased sex ratio was not explainable by higher adult mortality among males as the survival probabilities over years were similar (c. 70%) for both sexes. Alternative explanations for these highly female-biased sex ratios include sex-specific mortality at earlier life stages and environmental influences on the sex determination system. While further studies are required to differentiate between the alternatives, the observed sex-ratio bias is among the strongest reported in any amphibian population so far, and also in the direction opposite to that usually observed (males>females). Our analyses found no support for the contention that female common frogs in northern populations may reproduce only in every second year. However, both study populations were declining during the study period. "
21,4622,Some ecological aspects of fish populations in tropical ricefields,"Fish yields from the captural method of rice-fish farming system were monitored from 1985 to 1987. Seven species were obtained, with Trichogaster pectoralis, Clarias macrocephalus, and Channa striatus dominant and economically important. Low number of species is due to double cropping of rice resulting in increased human activities. The maximum yield obtained, 174.6 kg ha-1, is probably near the maximum for this type of rice-fish farming and the harvests have also stabilised when compared to those obtained in the early 1970s. Fish populations included more than one year-class in each harvest. A decline in individual weight, especially of herbivores, was recorded and correlated to the abundance of the species, and hence, to food supply. "
22,3265,Winter range expansion and relationships between landscape and morphometrics of midcontinent lesser snow geese,"Dramatic increases in population size and major extensions of winter range have occurred among midcontinent Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) in the last few decades. Agricultural landscapes within these range extensions provide winter foods that are distinctly different from those upon which most birds in this population subsisted until about 1970. I examined geographic variation in body and bill morphology of Lesser Snow Geese by comparing geese from: (1) traditionally used coastal brackish marshes contiguous to the Gulf of Mexico (n = 314), (2) agricultural landscapes centered around rice production and occurring up to 160 km inland from the coast (n = 200), and (3) agricultural landscapes with extensive corn production about 1,000 km north of the Gulf of Mexico (n = 125). Analyses of size and shape in body, head, and bill morphology were done on principal components of 10 metric variables. Geese from marsh habitats were largest in body size, those from rice prairies were intermediate but most variable, and those from the Missouri River valley farthest north were smallest. In addition, 'marsh' geese had thicker bills, longer skulls, and longer culmens than 'corn' geese. Five nonexclusive hypotheses (phenotypic selection, habitat selection, nutrition, fall migration endurance, and introgressive hybridization with Ross' Geese [Chen rossii]) are proposed to account for this geographic variation in external morphology. The interplay between winter range extension, habitat use, and morphology may have motivated large increases in continental population size and may be coupled with patterns of demographic and morphological change reported on breeding areas."
23,3533,"Hawksbill turtle monitoring in Cousin Island Special Reserve, Seychelles: an eight-fold increase in annual nesting numbers","Results of hawksbill turtle Eretmochelys imbricata nest monitoring on Cousin Island, Seychelles, indicate an 8-fold increase in abundance of nesting females since the early 1970s when the population was highly depleted. From 1999 to 2009, the population increased at an average rate of 16.5 turtles per season. Females were individually tagged, and nesting data were derived from indirect evidence of nesting attempts (i.e. tracks) and actual turtle sightings (56 to 60% of all encounters). Survey effort varied over the years for a variety of reasons, but the underlying trends over time are considered robust. To overcome biases associated with variable survey effort, we estimated population changes by fitting a Poisson distribution to data on numbers of times each individual was seen at this breeding site in a season. This was used to estimate unseen individuals, and hence the total number of nesting females each season. The maximum number of individuals emerging onto Cousin Island to nest within a single season was estimated to be 256 (2007 to 2008) compared to 23 in 1973. Tag returns indicate that many turtles nest on both Cousin and Cousine Islands (2 km apart), and that some inter-island nesting also occurs between Cousin and more remote islands within the Seychelles."
24,2012,"A plot study of forest floor litter frogs, Central Amazon, Brazil","Abundance and distribution of frogs inhabiting the litter layer of an area of primary lowland rain forest in Central Amazonia were studied over a period of 15 months by sampling 498 plots each 5m x 5m. The litter frog fauna of the area consists of 23 species, but only 12 of these were encountered in the plots, and 84% of the frogs encountered belonged to only six species. Total abundance and diversity within the plot data are strongly seasonal and peak in the late wet season. Both are positively correlated with litter volume and moisture. Most of this variation is due to seasonality of reproduction, as indicated by patterns of occurrence of juveniles of the most abundant species. These results indicate that the plot sampling method does not sample the entire fauna adequately. Since this technique has been used to study other tropical forest litter herpetofaunas, however, comparison with other studies may be useful. Species diversity of litter frogs appears to be approximately the same in lowland primary forest sites studied, averaging around 20 ‘regular’ species. Abundances, however, vary widely. Central American communities contain 14–15 frogs (100m)-2, African 9–10, South American 4–6, and South-east Asian 1–2. These differences may be due to differential nutrient availability in forests of different ages and/or on different soils. "
25,1366,"Variation and covariation in survival, dispersal, and population size in barn owls Tyto alba","1. Population dynamics are the result of variation in survival, recruitment, emigration and immigration rates. Covariation between these demographic rates critically affects the dynamics and magnitude of fluctuations in population size. Such covariation can arise by environmental factors affecting several rates in similar ways. Also demographic processes, such as the source-sink and the balanced dispersal process, are expected to lead to covariation between demographic rates. 2. Here, we study variation and covariation in survival, emigration, immigration, and the size of a Swiss barn owl (Tyto alba) population, and examine the factors associated with this variation. For practical reasons, survival and emigration are often confounded in studies of natural populations. We overcome this problem by jointly analysing live-recapture and dead-recovery data using recently developed statistical methods. 3. Mortality, emigration, the number of known immigrants, and population size were positively correlated over time. Neither the source-sink nor the balanced dispersal process is expected to lead to this pattern. 4. Survival was lower for juveniles than adults (mean 17% vs. 72%), and highly variable across years in both age classes. Snow cover, mean annual temperature and population density accounted for 32-47% of the variation in survival of juveniles and adults. Emigration was higher for juveniles than for adults, and adults emigrated more often when the population size was higher. 5. Our results showed that local population dynamics were affected by density dependence and the stochastic environmental factors snow cover and temperature. Rather than lending support to one of the two dispersal hypotheses, the patterns of correlation between survival, dispersal, and population size suggest strong fluctuations in environmental conditions that influence the dynamics of barn owl populations at a larger spatial scale."
26,3615,Hydrological attributes and rheophilic freshwater fish: stock assessment,"The mathematical and statistical advances in fitting stock assessment models enabled the emergence of the paradigm of ""integrated analysis"", which fits all available data to a single model of population dynamics that traditionally has total catch as the only forcing function of the system. This approach, however, allowed us to include, in a flexible way, the effect of hydrological regime as an additional forcing function. We tried to achieve this flexibility by making the annual recruitment rates and spawning biomass adjustable to the attributes of the hydrological cycle data. Our models showed that these attributes are influential in the population dynamics of Brycon hilarii of the Northern Pantanal, and their inclusion in the models allowed best partial fits (which considered fits only to the data components length- and age-compositions, CPUE of juveniles and adults) than the Base-case (without hydrological attributes). The best partial fits where obtained when the attributes ""delay of floods"" and ""intensity of floods"" were forcing the spawning biomass and the annual recruitment respectively, indicating that these characteristics of the population may be influenced by specific attributes of the water level. The use of integrated modeling contributed with the advancement of population ecology knowledge of rheophilic fish. It is recommended that freshwater fisheries management be integrated into the hydrology management. "
27,3108,Conserving bird species in Japanese farmland: Past achievements and future challenges,"A high proportion of threatened and near-threatened species in the world now inhabit farmland.; Although much data regarding the impact of agriculture on farmland biodiversity have been accumulated; in Western countries, such information, particularly on the impact of rice cultivation, is fragmentary in; other parts of the world and has rarely been disseminated internationally. Therefore, this paper aims; to clarify what information has become available through earlier studies in Japan, where farmland mainly; consists of rice paddy areas, and give directions for future studies about the impact of agriculture on; farmland birds in Japan. This study made three notable observations. First, a review of earlier studies; of farmland bird species in Japan uncovered some evidence of both increases (e.g., wildfowl and cranes); and declines (e.g., waders) in population size. Second, this paper closely examined case studies of two; types of typical farmland birds: (1) geese and cranes foraging on crops and/or harvested remains of crops; and (2) waders and egrets foraging on small organisms in farmland, not agricultural crops. This portion of; the study identified some potential routes through which human activities in farmland affect bird species; in Japan, and offered practical implications for conservation and management of these species supported; by scientific data. Finally, based on the results of this review, three key tasks for future conservation studies; and practices in Japanese farmland were suggested: (1) establishing quantitative indices based on; monitoring surveys in farmland to track the population status, (2) collecting further evidence of the; impact of agriculture, particularly on population-level responses by birds, and in a food-web context,; and (3) applying evidence-based conservation to practice."
28,3993,"Population trends of the forest bird community on the pacific island of Rota, Mariana Islands","The Pacific island of Rota is part of the Mariana archipelago, and is located approximately 60 km north of the island of Guam. Two Rota endemics, the Mariana Crow (Corvus kubaryi) and the Rota Bridled White-eye (Zosterops rotensis), have declined dramatically in the last 20 years. We examined trends in abundance of eight terrestrial bird species (six native, two exotic) on Rota between 1982 and 2004, and found that seven of them declined significantly, with five species showing declines >50%. Only Micronesian Starlings (Aplonis opaca) increased in abundance. Declines occurred in species abundant in both forested and open habitats, suggesting that the declines were unlikely to be simply the result of deforestation. While the introduction of the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) on Guam caused the collapse of that island's avifauna, we do not believe that Rota's declines are due to the establishment of a snake population. Other, as yet unidentified, agents are likely to be responsible. We suggest that future research into the causative agent(s) of decline focus on the comparatively common declining species, rather than studying small populations of endangered species. "
29,1888,The impact of raptors on the abundance of upland passerines and waders,"The issue of predator limitation of vertebrate prey populations is contentious, particularly when it involves species of economic or conservation value. In this paper, we examine the case of raptor predation on upland passerines and waders in Scotland. We analysed the abundance of five wader and passerine species on an upland sporting estate in southern Scotland during an eight-year period when hen harrier, peregrine and merlin numbers increased due to strict law enforcement. The abundance of meadow pipit and skylark declined significantly during this time. Golden plover also showed a declining trend, whereas curlew increased significantly and there was a near significant increase in lapwings. Contrasting the local population trends of these species with trends on nearby areas revealed higher rates of decline for meadow pipit and skylark at the site where raptors increased, but no differences in trends for any of the three wader species. There was a negative relationship between the number of breeding harriers and meadow pipit abundance the same year and between total annual raptor numbers and meadow pipit abundance. Predation rates of meadow pipit and skylark determined from observations at harrier nests suggested that predation in June was sufficient to remove up to 40% of the June meadow pipit population and up to 34% of the June skylark population. This 'quasi-natural' experiment suggests that harrier predation limited the abundance of their main prey, meadow pipit, and possibly the abundance of skylark. Thus, high densities of harriers may in theory reduce the abundance of the prey species which determine their breeding densities, potentially leading to lower harrier breeding densities in subsequent years. We found no evidence to suggest that raptor predation limited the populations of any of the three wader species. We infer that concerns over the impact of natural densities of hen harriers on vulnerable upland waders are unjustified."
30,3991,Ecological coexistence of low-density populations of Apodemus sylvaticus and A. flavicollis (Mammalia: Rodentia),"The population size (estimated by POPAN method) and potential interspecific; competition and spatial distribution in relation to vegetation features were studied; in two sympatric and syntopic rodent species, Apodemus sylvaticus and Apodemus; flavicollis. The study was performed by capturemarkrecapture study within a trap grid,; at two adjacent forest sites in Mediterranean central Italy. We found that the population; sizes of the two rodent species were comparatively lower than those recorded in conspecifics; from other central Italian areas, and that the potential for interspecific competition; was low at both sites, as revealed by the lack of negative correlations between; the relative abundances of the two species after Monte Carlo analyses. The number of; captures of both rodent species was not correlated to either the number of trees in each; grid cell or the sum of tree diameters. The general implications of the obtained results; are discussed."
31,2020,Population size of Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis) correlates with water level,"Population estimates of the Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis) extending over a 25-year period reveal an annual population cycle that reaches a low during spring and a high during fall. The four earliest years (1972-1976) preceded a U.S. Supreme Court water rights decision intended to protect pupfish habitat. Mean and maximum population sizes during those four years were significantly lower than during subsequent periods examined through 1997, and annual minimum population size was significantly lower during 1972-1976 than during 1991-1997. Annual maximum population size is positively correlated with water level for the month in which it occurred as well as for the month one year prior to the time of the estimate. The lowest historic water levels occurred during the period 1972-1976, and over the past 60,000 years comparable or lower water levels may have occurred only during the altithermal, about 6000 years before the present. During these two periods the Devils Hole pupfish population has probably experienced its most severe bottlenecks."

The molecular analyses confirmedspeciesidentity,revealedstronghaplotypeconnectivityamongBrazilianstudysitesandshowed a low genetic diversity in Brazil when compared with thenative populations, suggesting few individuals started the invasion. Four hypotheses could explain this colonizing event: C. limbata was released by aquarium fish keepers; larvae or juveniles were transported via ship ballast water; the species has rafted alongside oil rigs; they crossed the Atlantic Ocean through normal larval dispersal or naturally rafting alongside drifting objects. The rafting hypotheses are favoured, but all four possibilities are plausible and could have happened in combination. "
33,512,Restoration of a multi-species seabird colony,"Nesting herring and great black-backed gulls (Larus argentatus and Larus marinus) were removed from a recently abandoned tern (Sterna sp.) colony through a combination of poisoning and shooting. Following gull control, all three species of tern that had nested in the colony prior to the arrival of the gulls returned and nested in increasing numbers. In addition to the restoration of the terns, removal of the gulls led to colonization and/or significant increases in populations of four other seabirds. Gull numbers were greatly reduced by initial poisoning efforts, but continued immigration from surrounding colonies has required an on-going program of shooting to eliminate territorial birds nesting in areas utilized by terns and other species. In situations calling for active management we advocate rapid, focused intervention, and stress the importance of inter-organizational cooperation, and an active program of public education."
34,2879,Waterbird populations at the Orange River mouth from 1980-2001: a re-assessment of its Ramsar status,"The Orange River mouth (ORM), at the end of the longest river in South Africa, is one of few perennial wetlands on the arid south-west African coast. The ORM supports a large number of waterbirds, with a maximum of 20 653-26 653 individuals of 57 species being recorded in December 1985. Because of its importance for waterbirds, the ORM is recognised as a Ramsar site and an Important Bird Area. Since being designated a Ramsar site in 1991, however, the number of waterbirds has decreased (by c. 74% since the first two surveys in 1980 and 1985). During 13 surveys conducted from December 1995 to August 2001 an average of 6 873 (±1 719 SD; n = 6) and 5 547 (±2 039 SD; n = 7) individuals were recorded during summer and winter, respectively. This decrease, in conjunction with the degradation of the c. 300ha saltmarsh resulted in the ORM being placed on the Ramsar Convention’s Montreux Record in 1995. The decrease in the number of waterbirds at the ORM is mainly attributable to the absence of large numbers of Cape Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) and non-breeding Common Terns (Sterna hirundo), with no breeding of the former being recorded on islands in the mouth area after 1993. The decrease in numbers of these two species may be attributed to both on- and off-site factors. During a re-evaluation of the revised Ramsar criteria, we found that the site still meets three of the four Ramsar criteria under which it was originally designated in 1991 and five of the eight new criteria. The establishment of a transboundary statutory protected area will allow for the implementation of conservation-directed management measures. We propose various management recommendations to improve the conservation of wetland birds at the ORM. "

36,2030,"Population dynamics of two rodent species in agro-ecosystems of central Argentina: intra-specific competition, land-use, and climate effects","Understanding the role of feedback structure (endogenous processes) and exogenous (climatic and environmental) factors in shaping the dynamics of natural populations is a central challenge within the field of population ecology. We attempted to explain the numerical fluctuations of two sympatric rodent species in agro-ecosystems of central Argentina using Royama's theoretical framework for analyzing the dynamics of populations influenced by exogenous climatic forces. We found that both rodent species show a first-order negative feedback structure, suggesting that these populations are regulated by intra-specific competition (limited by food, space, or enemy-free space). In Akodon azarae endogenous structure seems to be very strongly influenced by human land-use represented by annual minimum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), with spring and summer rainfall having little influence upon carrying capacity. Calomys venustus' population dynamics, on the other hand, seem to be more affected by local climate, also with spring and summer rainfall influencing the carrying capacity of the environment, but combined with spring mean temperature.

37,668,Population Stability of a Tropical Lizard,"Populations of Anolis limifrons were censused for 19 yr at the Lutz site on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) and for 4 yr at 20 other sites in C Panama. Census data provided estimates of population density at the end of the wet season (December) and indices of per-capita food intake and annual recruitment. Year-to-year changes in density of as much as 5- to 8-fold were observed at Lutz and of 2- to 3-fold were observed at other sites. Changes in population density at 11 BCI sites were synchronous over 1983-1986, while population density fluctuated independently at non-BCI sites. Populations of A. limifrons exhibited significantly greater generation-to-generation variability than populatioans of West Indian Anolis and of lizards in temperate-zone habitats. An index of per-capita food intake was negatively related to density both for temporal comparisons at Lutz and for spatial comparisons among sites. The relative number of young individuals at the end of the wet season was negatively related to population density and positively related to an estimate of food intake. Recruitment was depressed when density was high and enhanced when food was relatively abundant. Despite the potential for density-dependent regulation, A. limifrons populations are highly unstable, presumably because of random perturbations of the environment. Rainfall is implicated causally. Population attributes that contribute to instability are rapid population turnover and a middle-level trophic position in a complex food web. -from Author"
38,1568,Role of predation in short-term population fluctuations of some birds and mammals in Fennoscandia,"We tested the hypothesis that synchronous fluctuations in small game species in boreal Fennoscandia are caused by varying predation pressure. The main prey of predators are the cyclically superabundant voles. Small game species (alternative prey) are rare compared to voles. The following 4 predictions were checked: (1) Predators should shift their diet from main prey to alternative prey as main prey decline. - This was confirmed using data on red fox (Vulpes vulpes L.) diet.; (2) The mortality rate of alternative prey should be inversely correlated to the abundance of main prey. - This was true for mountain hare (Lepus timidus L.) mortality rates and the rate of nest predation on black grouse (Tetrao tetrix L.).; (3) The total consumption of prey by all the predators should at least equal the critical losses in alternative prey during a decline year. - A tentative estimate of predator consumption amounted to 10 times the losses in grouse and hare.; and (4) The absence of synchrony between the species in the boreonemoral region should be associated with a more diverse diet of predators. - This was the case for red fox diets throughout Sweden. Although all 4 predictions were confirmed, we could not necessarily exclude other hypotheses involving changes in quality or quantity of plant food. "
39,1593,Mountain hare populations on islands: effects of predation by red fox,"On islands off the west coast of Sweden the density of mountain hares (Lepus timidus L.) is very high. One of the main predators on hares, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes L.), is only present during short periods. Data on hare density and predation by red fox and eagle owl (Bubo bubo (L.)) has been analyzed from five islands over several years. Winter mortality in years with low predation pressure was independent of hare density. But when red fox or eagle owl were present on islands (i.e., high predation pressure) winter mortality became density dependent. Thus, at low density, winter mortality did not increase through red fox predation. But at densities up to two hares/ha, predation pressure was increasing and could be limiting for these populations. At still higher hare density predation pressure became less intensive. The functional response for foxes preying on hares showed a type II or a sigmoid type III response pattern. In normal summers, the population increase due to reproduction was at least two-fold. When a fox was present there was instead a sharp decrease in hare numbers. Fox predation had a stronger effect in summer than in winter. By switching between islands and mainland areas from winter to summer, a fox can stabilize fluctuations in hare numbers on the islands. This is dependent on how often the ice permits a fox to reach an island and the lack of numerical response by predators. "
40,1569,Dynamics of the arctic fox population in Sweden,"The patterns and mechanisms of these fluctuations in Arctic fox Alopex lagopus numbers through den inventories during 20 yr (1974-1993). Time series analyses confirmed a four-year cyclicity in both arctic fox numbers and litter size. However, the different geographical regions were not in synchrony. The fox population in the southern parts of the distribution range has shown regular peaks during the whole period, whereas those in the northern and middle parts of Sweden have declined since 1982. In the northernmost county also litter sizes have decreased. These differences coincided with an absence of vole and lemming (Microtinae and Arvicolinae) peaks in the north. Experimental feeding confirmed that food availability had direct impact on breeding success and litter size. It is concluded that the total number of Arctic foxes in Sweden in 1994 is as low as 40-80 animals. -from Authors"
41,4537,A reassessment of the extinction risk of the Critically Endangered Oxapampa poison frog Ameerega planipaleae (Dendrobatidae),"Assessments of extinction risk are required to inform conservation action, but the usefulness of assessments is undermined if they are not current. Ameerega planipaleae, a poison frog endemic to the cloud forests of central Peru, was last assessed in 2004. We therefore sought to provide updated data to inform the reassessment of this species. Based on our findings, we recommend that this frog remain categorized as Critically Endangered, but under modified criteria, and that conservation actions are taken to reduce the pressures of local threats, especially the overuse of agrochemicals."
42,3784,Trade and habitat change virtually eliminate the Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus from Ghana,"The heavily traded Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus is believed to have undergone rapid population decline, yet there are almost no quantitative data on abundance changes over time from anywhere within its huge range. We reviewed the species historical abundance across Ghana, undertook targeted searches during 3- to 5-day visits to 42 100-km2 cells across the countrys forest zone, repeated counts at 22 parrot roosts first performed two decades ago and gauged around 900 peoples perceptions of the decline and its causes. In over 150 days of fieldwork, just 32 groups (maximum group size = 12) were recorded in 10 cells. Encounter rates  averaged 0.15 individuals per hour of targeted search, around 15 times lower than those recorded in the early 1990s. No active roosts; were found, and only 18 individuals were recorded in three roost areas that each harboured 7001200 birds two decades ago. Interviewees stressed the importance of very tall trees of commercially important species such as Terminalia superba and Ceiba  pentandra for nesting and roosting, and believed that the felling of large trees on farmland (42% of responses) and trapping for trade (37%) were the two main causes of decline. Ghana has lost 9099% of its Grey Parrots since 1992, a time when the population had; presumably already been seriously reduced by two decades of extremely heavy trade. There is no evidence that, away from one or two localities, declines are less severe anywhere else within the West African range of P. erithacus, or across the entire range of the recently split Timneh Parrot Psittacus timneh."
43,2843,Bald eagles and sea otters in the Aleutian archipelago: indirect effects of trophic cascades,"Because sea otters (Enhydra lutris) exert a wide array of direct and indirect effects on coastal marine ecosystems throughout their geographic range, we investigated the potential influence of sea otters on the ecology of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, USA. We studied the diets, productivity, and density of breeding Bald Eagles on four islands during 1993[long dash]1994 and 2000[long dash]2002, when sea otters were abundant and scarce, respectively. Bald Eagles depend on nearshore marine communities for most of their prey in this ecosystem, so we predicted that the recent decline in otter populations would have an indirect negative effect on diets and demography of Bald Eagles. Contrary to our predictions, we found no effects on density of breeding pairs on four islands from 1993[long dash]1994 to 2000[long dash]2002. In contrast, diets and diet diversity of Bald Eagles changed considerably between the two time periods, likely reflecting a change in prey availability resulting from the increase and subsequent decline in sea otter populations. The frequency of sea otter pups, rock greenling (Hexagammus lagocephalus), and smooth lumpsuckers (Aptocyclus ventricosus) in the eagle's diet declined with corresponding increases in Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and various species of seabirds during the period of the recent otter population decline. Breeding success and productivity of Bald Eagles also increased during this time period, which may be due to the higher nutritional quality of avian prey consumed in later years. Our results provide further evidence of the wide-ranging indirect effects of sea otter predation on nearshore marine communities and another apex predator, the Bald Eagle. Although the indirect effects of sea otters are widely known, this example is unique because the food-web pathway transcended five species and several trophic levels in linking one apex predator to another."

45,2167,"Nesting ecology, current status, and conservation of sea turtles on an uninhabited beach in Florida, USA","Although nesting beaches are critical resources for sea turtles, most beaches in the United States are disturbed by human influence, including human access, artificial lighting, and habitat alteration. In contrast, very few undisturbed beaches remain along the Atlantic coast, and these areas represent unique habitats that can help decipher the impacts of development on various species. We monitored nesting patterns and hatching success of three sea turtle species (Caretta caretta, Chelonia mydas, and Dermochelys coriacea) from 1985 to 2003 on Canaveral National Seashore, an uninhabited 38.3 km stretch of beach in Florida. We monitored the number of nests deposited annually, hatching success, predation rates, and spatial nesting patterns. Clutch sizes varied within, but not among years, most likely due to variation in size of nesting females rather than climate change or resource availability. The number of nests increased over the study period for all three species, indicating growing populations. Higher numbers of nests were deposited on the southern end of our beach than on the northern end. Hatching success did not vary by species, but was dependent on nest-protection effort, which increased during the study period. Protecting more nests with wire screens resulted in lower predation rates. We did not find any evidence suggesting that predators are using nest markers to locate eggs, even after using the same method of marking nests for 19 years. Our conservation efforts have lowered predation levels through increased screening effort, and over time the number of nests laid increased for each species. Collecting baseline data on nesting patterns in undisturbed locations will allow comparisons to be made on nesting trends and patterns at geographically close, but disturbed, localities. "
46,3946,Population fluctuations of the house mouse in a Peruvian loma and the functional response of burrowing owls,"In this study, we show that the house mouse (Mus musculus) is the most abundant small mammal in the National Reserve of Lachay in central Peru, and that its large population ?uctuations are independent of seasonality. Also, we found that M. musculus is the main small mammal prey of burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) in Lachay, and that owls respond functionally to mouse abundance. In addition, vegetation cover seems to have a strong effect on small mammal predation by burrowing owls, and possibly other predators such as eagles and foxes. We propose the hypothesis that burrowing owls in arid environments can survive several months eating only arthropods, but that their reproduction is synchronized with a highly nutritious diet, provided by small mammal consumption. The principal prediction of this alternative prey hypothesis is now supported by our data from a tropical ecosystem."
47,678,Effects of Population-Density and Supplemental Food on Reproduction in Song Sparrows,"Population density and reproduction in Melospiza melodia on Mandarte Island, B.C., varied widely from 1975-1986. Several measures of reproductive success declined as population density increased by 6 times. At peak density, females produced 1/4 the number of young produced at low densities. Supplemental food advanced laying date; increased clutch size, the number of breeding attempts, nestling weight and the number of independent young produced; and reduced brood parasitism and the interval between successful nesting attempts. Supplemental food was associated with reduced adult survival to the next breeding season, perhaps because of increased competition for territories with feeders after the feeding experiment. -from Authors"
48,1967,"Aquaculture, non-native salmonid invasions and associated declines of native fishes in Northern Patagonian lakes","Even though intensive aquaculture production of salmonids in lakes occurs in many locations around the world published studies on the survival and reproductive success of escaped cultured salmonids in freshwater ecosystems are not common. A recent expansion of aquaculture in Chile has led it to become the world's second largest producer of cultured salmonids. 2. We document the recent history of escaped and self-sustaining salmonid populations over a wide spatial scale and a long temporal scale in Chilean Patagonian lakes. Our hypotheses are that salmonid density in lakes will be higher where there is intensive aquaculture, due to greater numbers of potential escapees. Secondly, if non-native salmonids have adverse impacts on native fishes, increases in the abundance of non-native species should be associated with decreases in relative abundance of native species. Finally, if the first two hypotheses are correct we anticipate that diets of salmonids may show evidence of predation on native fishes, diet overlap with native species, and evidence of the influence of feed from aquaculture operations in the diets of salmonids and native fishes. 3. We sampled six lakes with gill nets from 1992 to 2001. Our results show that the relative abundance of free-living salmonids is closely related to the level of fish farming production. Salmonids are the top predators and in lakes with fish farming the main prey item is native fishes. The relative abundance of native fishes has decreased, most likely due to predation by salmonids. 4. Our study contributes to the understanding of the effects of non-native salmonids in oligotrophic lakes, and it provides a starting point to judge the establishment of new fish farming sites in lakes around the world. "
49,4105,Population responses of a native bird species to rat control," Invasive-predator control can be beneficial to native species, but it is important to quantify those benefits to ensure they justify the costs. In a previous study (20052011), a modified before-after-control-impact (BACI) design was used to estimate the effect of rat control in farmland forest fragments on vital rates of North Island robins (Petroica longipes), a New Zealand native bird species often targeted in private restoration initiatives. Based on the results, continuous rat control was implemented in 5 fragments predicted to have a high probability of subpopulation growth. Here, I report subsequent abundance estimates; the number of robins in those fragments increased from 57 to 134, from 20112014, closely matching the prediction of 131 based on the previous vital rate estimates. In comparison, numbers declined or stayed relatively stable over this period in 8 non-controlled fragments, except for 1 fragment that was adjacent to 1 of the controlled fragments and therefore would have received juveniles dispersing from it. Therefore, the results illustrate that where there is uncertainty about where to conduct control operations, short-term data on survival and reproduction can be used to predict longer-term effects, allowing predator-control efforts to be done strategically."
50,2622,Density-dependent population growth in a reintroduced population of North Island saddlebacks,"1. Reintroductions provide a good opportunity to study density-dependent population growth, as populations can be studied at a range of densities and the change in density is not confounded with environmental conditions. An understanding of density dependence is also necessary to predict dynamics of reintroduced populations under different management regimens, and assess the extent to which they can be harvested for further reintroductions. 2. We monitored a North Island saddleback (Philesturnus rufusater) population for 6 years after reintroduction to Mokoia, a 135 ha island in New Zealand that was made suitable for saddlebacks by eradicating introduced Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). We modelled adult and juvenile survival using Program MARK, and modelled numbers of young fledged per pair using Proc Mixed in SAS with individual female as a random factor. 3. Juvenile survival clearly declined as the population increased, and the decline was closely correlated with the number of breeding pairs. Reproduction also showed a clear decline that was explained by two factors: a difference in quality between territories occupied immediately after reintroduction and those occupied later, and an overall decline as the number of pairs increased. Reproduction was also strongly affected by age, and this needed to be accounted for when modelling density dependence. 4. A stochastic simulation model incorporating these dynamics closely predicted the observed population growth. The equilibrium population size was insensitive to density dependence in reproduction, but highly sensitive to density dependence in juvenile survival. 5. The model is being used to plan management strategies for potential reintroductions of saddlebacks to mainland areas with predator control. The species is currently confined to predator-free islands and one fenced mainland sanctuary."
51,1357,Dynamics and Viability of a New Zealand Robin Population Reintroduced to Regenerating Fragmented Habitat,"New Zealand Robins (Petroica australis) were reintroduced to Tiritiri Matangi, a highly modified island undergoing an extensive revegetation program. The island had only 13 ba of fragmented forest likely to be suitable for robins. We wished to determine whether the population was likely to persist until additional habitat became available through maturation of the revegetation and, therefore, whether it was sensible to reintroduce this species early in the restoration program. We used an information-theoretic approach to model survival, fecundity, sex ratio, and juvenile dispersal for this population, based on data collected in the first 6years after reintroduction. This involved nominating a limited set of plausible models for each process and then selecting the models that best explained the data based on Akaike's information criterion. We used mark-recapture analysis on survey data to model survival and general linear modeling on fecundity data. The best models were as follows: (1) juvenile survival declined as population size increased, whereas adult survival was constant among years; (2) fecundity was substantially lower for females in their first year after translocation and varied among forest patches, but did not vary among age classes or years; (3) the expected sex ratio of recruits was 50:50; (4) the distribution of recruits depended on the number of existing residents in patches and patch sizes, but not on patch isolation. We used VORTEX to simulate the dynamics of the population based on these models and associated parameter estimates. The population was predicted to have negligible chance of extinction over several decades under current conditions, and this prediction was not sensitive to uncertainty in parameter estimates or model structure. Maturation of the planted matrix should allow the population to expand to several hundred birds over the next few decades, preventing extreme loss of genetic variation. We therefore conclude that the early reintroduction of this species was reasonable, despite the limited habitat available at the time. Our results show that it is critical to obtain data for the first few years after reintroduction if habitat is likely to be limited, because it is otherwise impossible to detect density-dependent processes critical to population viability. Results also show that the first year after reintroduction may be misleading if considered alone."
52,2143,Potential for restoration of the Roanoke River population of Atlantic sturgeon,"The Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) was historically abundant within Albemarie Sound and the Roanoke River in North Carolina, but declined dramatically in the late 1800s in response to intensive fishing. Recent evidence suggests that the population may be recovering, following a statewide prohibition on harvest in 1991. A recruitment index generally increased from 1992 through 2001. Estuarine habitat for juveniles appears to be suitable, resulting in mean growth rates for age 1 fish ranging from 0.59 to 0.81 mm day-1. A restoration goal of 7000-21 000 subadult and adult Atlantic sturgeon was developed for the Roanoke River, based on historical landings records. Bycatch mortality because of commercial gill-netting in Albermarle Sound could affect recovery. Telemetry and netting data indicate that juvenile Atlantic sturgeon in the sound are most abundant in shallow nearshore areas where commercial gill-netting is concentrated. However, immediate mortality rates from survey and commercial gill-netting in Albemarle Sound were only 0-2%. Additional field studies are needed to refine estimates of immediate- and longer-term mortality associated with gill-net bycatch."
53,2150,"Seasonal and ontogenetic changes in distribution and abundance of smooth flounder, Pleuronectes putnami, and winter flounder, Pleuronectes americanus, along estuarine depth and salinity gradients","The distribution and abundance of two potentially competing flatfish species, smooth flounder, Pleuronectes putnami, and winter flounder, Pleuronectes americanus, were examined along salinity and depth gradients in upper Great Bay Estuary, New Hampshire. Both species were abundant in the estuary but exhibited differential use of habitats along both gradients. Smooth flounder were most abundant at the mesohaline, riverine habitat, whereas winter flounder were most abundant at the polyhaline, open-bay habitat. Both species exhibited a generalized up-river movement as salinity increased with the seasons. Smooth flounder showed ontogenetic changes in distribution along the depth gradient, with smallest individuals occupying shallowest depths. Intertidal mudflats were an important nursery area for young-of-the-year smooth flounder. Winter flounder showed little separation by size along the depth gradient, and few were found in the intertidal mudflat habitat. The potential for competition between these two species is lessened by their partial segregation along the gradients examined."
54,1521,"Stochastic dynamic population model of North Sea sandeels, and its application to precautionary management procedures.","Sandeels (sand lance) are important prey for fish, bird and mammal predators. In the North Sea, they are also the target of the region's largest 'single-species' fishery, with annual yields of ca. 0.8 million tonnes, mostly (>90%) comprising the species Ammodytes marinus. This species is relatively short-lived, and has large, naturally occurring, population fluctuations that confound the use of traditional methods of fishery forecasting for their management. Here we present a stochastic age-structured model that describes the population dynamics of North Sea sandeels. Recruitment to the population occurs according to a stochastic, autocorrelated Ricker function. Uncertainty in the recruitment parameters was quantified by bootstrap analysis, leading to 3 different versions of the model that allowed a range of potentially viable recruitment scenarios to be explored. Monte Carlo simulations were performed under different fishing mortality levels, and the responses of the population assessed. The model is used to quantify recruitment and the likelihood of the sandeel spawning stock biomass falling below 600 000 and 430 000 t, which represent the precautionary and biomass limit levels, respectively, imposed by managers upon the stock."
55,4330,Drastic population size change in two populations of the Golden-striped salamander over a forty-year period—Are eucalypt plantations to blame?,"Over the last half century the Iberian peninsula has seen the large scale planting of exotic gum trees (Eucalyptus sp.) therewith reducing space for native wildlife. An additional effect of the gum tree plantations may be the lowering of the water table in adjacent streams, to which amphibian species with a larval niche in the running sections of small streams would be especially susceptible. In northwestern Iberia that niche is occupied by the Golden-striped salamander, Chioglossa lusitanica. I here report on the demographic trends of two C. lusitanica populations over a forty-year period, in two areas of one mountain range near Porto in northwestern Portugal. In both areas advantage was taken of the migration pattern of C. lusitanica to sites for aestivation and breeding in summer and fall. The area of the Silveirinhos brook was transformed in a plantation of gum trees shortly after the research started, while the area of Poço do Inferno remained virtually unaffected. At Silveirinhos the adult C. lusitanica population declined by one or two orders of magnitude, from ca. 1500 individuals to less than 50 at present. Demographic models that operate under a uniform larval mortality yielded population sizes that are compatible with field observations, including the late onset of the decline at 14 or more years after the planting of the gum trees and the near-extinction at year 32. An alternative reason for the relatively recent population collapse of C. lusitanica may have been disease, but no sick individuals or corpses have become available for clinical investigation. Conversely, the control population at Poço do Inferno increased in size by a factor of five or more. These data support the hypothesis that gum tree plantations have a strong negative effect on C. lusitanica. The population size increase at Poço do Inferno is probably attributable to the installation of wastewater treatment in the adjacent town of Valongo, with a discharge in the Simão river and closely connected to Poço do Inferno. This result suggests that the Simão river contributes to the Poço do Inferno population and that medium-large streams may constitute prime C. lusitanica habitat. Larval mortalities estimated for stable and declining populations are remarkable close (0.69 and 0.73, respectively), but dissimilar to the larval mortality at ca. 0.51 of an increasing population such as at Poço do Inferno. Suggestions for further research include (i) the continued monitoring of the Silveirinhos population with inspections at 5-10 year intervals, and (ii) checking for the persistence of C. lusitanica populations in and around gum tree plantations where the species was reported decades ago."

The analysis included the variables year and season."
57,2354,Predicting the growth of a small introduced muskox population using population prediction intervals,"1. A key issue in ecology is the prediction of future population fluctuations. Such population predictions are fundamental for population-viability analysis and are essential for assessing the implications of various management actions. Development of reliable population predictions is however, difficult because it requires estimation and modelling of the separate effects of the deterministic components of the population dynamics as well as the stochastic influences on the population fluctuations. Here we model the stochastic dynamics of an introduced population of muskox Ovibos moschatus in the Dovrefjell mountains of central Norway, using a simple model without density regulation. Our aim is to examine quantitatively factors affecting the accuracy of the population projections by applying the concept of Population Prediction Interval (PPI). 2. The long-term growth rate was ŝ = 0·0511, assuming no density dependence. The environmental variance was relatively large (σe2 = 0·0159). This gives a deterministic growth rate of r̂ = 0·0591. However, accounting for losses due to various kinds of human activities resulted in a nearly doubling of s (ŝ = 0·0980). 3. Autumn temperature and late winter snow depth were each able to explain a significant proportion of the annual variation in population growth rates. 4. The impact of environmental stochasticity made the PPI wide after only a few years. Uncertainties in the estimates of the population parameters were quite small and had a minor impact on the PPI. 5. A sensitivity analysis showed that ignoring demographic stochasticity led to an overestimate of the environmental variance σe2, but that the impact on the width of the PPI was small. 6. This study shows that reliable projections of future population growth, even based on simple population models without density regulation, are dependent on assessment of the accuracy in the population predictions that must be based on estimating and modelling the stochastic influences on the population dynamics.

58,2340,Implications of Urbanization for Artisanal Parrotfish Fisheries in the Western Solomon Islands,"Increasing migration into urbanized centers in the Solomon Islands poses a great threat to adjacent coral reef fisheries because of negative effects on the fisheries and because it further erodes customary management systems. Parrotfish fisheries are of particular importance because the feeding habits of parrotfish (scrape and excavate coral) are thought to be critical to the resilience of coral reefs and to maintaining coral reef health within marine protected areas. We investigated the ecological impact of localized subsistence and artisanal fishing pressure on parrotfish fisheries in Gizo Town, Western Solomon Islands, by analyzing the density and size distribution of parrotfishwith an underwater visual census (UVC), recall diary (i.e., interviews with fishers), and creel surveys to independently assess changes in abundance and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) over 2 years. We then compared parrotfish data from Gizo Town with equivalent data from sites open to and closed to fishing in Kida and Nusa Hope villages, which have different customary management regimes. Results indicated a gradient of customary management effectiveness. Parrotfish abundance was greater in customary management areas closed to fishing, especially with regard to larger fish sizes, than in areas open to fishing. The decline in parrotfish abundance from 2004 to 2005 in Gizo was roughly the same magnitude as the difference in abundance decline between inside and outside customary management marine reserves. Our results highlight how weak forms of customary management can result in the rapid decline of vulnerable fisheries around urbanized regions, and we present examples in which working customary management systems (Kinda and Nusa Hope) can positively affect the conservation of parrotfish-and reef fisheries in general-in the highly biodiverse Coral Triangle region.

59,2882,Impacts of introducing Nile tilapia on the fisheries of a tropical reservoir in North-eastern Brazil,"Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (L.), has been introduced in most tropical and subtropical regions of the world to improve inland fisheries and aquaculture. This species is generally viewed as beneficial where introduced, but the environmental impacts of its widespread introductions are uncertain and not well understood. In this study, a 30-year time series of fisheries records from a tropical reservoir was divided into five equal periods of 6years and compared. The introduction of Nile tilapia did not increase the total catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE), the number of fishers actively fishing or their per capita income. Conversely, a significant reduction in the CPUE of other commercially important species was observed after the introduction of Nile tilapia in the reservoir. Although other factors cannot be rule out as possible explanations of the observed changes in the reservoir fisheries, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that these changes may have been caused, at least partially, by the introduction of the Nile tilapia.

60,1662,Breeding bird communities of upland hardwood forest 12 years after shelterwood logging,"We studied the relationship between the effects of shelterwood logging on forest structure and long-term abundance, diversity, and richness of breeding bird communities in an upland hardwood forest at Land Between The Lakes (LBL), Kentucky and Tennessee. Breeding bird communities (point counts in 1987-1989, 1999) and forest vegetation structure (1987-1988, 1999), the year prior to, 1 and 2 years after, and 12 years after shelterwood logging were compared between logged and uncut (>40 years since logging) forest sites. Shelterwood sites had significantly greater mid-story canopy. General avian community trends demonstrated an initial increase in diversity and density the year following logging, and decreased diversity and density in 1999. Uncut sites showed a general decline in diversity in 1989 and 1999. The influence of shelterwood logging varied among taxa and among foraging guilds. Specifically, the ground-gleaning guild was significantly more diverse on uncut sites than on shelterwood sites. We attribute this greater diversity to a more complex and diverse forest understory with greater opportunity for foraging. Logging did not significantly influence diversity, evenness, or richness of the nesting guilds. We examined four priority species of concern (as designated by Partners in Flight): Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus), Kentucky Warbler (Oporonis formosus), and Hooded Warbler (Wilsonia citrina). Of these, population densities of Wood Thrush were significantly lower on logged sites than on uncut sites while worm-eating warblers were higher on logged sites. The Kentucky Warbler and Hooded Warbler did not occur on logged sites. Higher densities of birds in our study sites compared to regional surveys suggest LBL is an important local area for breeding bird communities. "
61,2036,"Breeding distribution and population decline of globally threatened Grey-necked Picathartes Picathartes oreas in Mbam Minkom Mountain Forest, southern Cameroon","The Grey-necked Picathartes Picathartes oreas, considered Vulnerable, is an enigmatic ground-dwelling bird endemic to the central African equatorial rainforest and belongs to a family of only two species. Its distribution extends to the two Endemic Bird Areas within Cameroon (Guinea Congo forest biome and Cameroon mountain arc) and its population is thought to be in decline throughout its range due to increasing habitat fragmentation and disturbance. During MarchApril 2003 and June and October 2007 we surveyed Grey-necked Picathartes in the north-western region of the Mbam Minkom Mountain Forest. In JanuaryMarch 2006 we surveyed the entire mountain range and found 90 breeding and 24 potential breeding sites, mostly located on the western slopes. From the complete survey, we estimated the population at 44 breeding individuals. Populations were highest in the north-west region but had apparently declined from 40 breeding individuals in 2003 to 20 in 2007. This region accounted for 41% of the entire population on the mountain range during the 2006 survey. The Mbam Minkom/Kala Important Bird Area was designated based on the presence of Grey-necked Picathartes but is under high pressure of imminent destruction from agricultural encroachment and illegal timber exploitation. These results have important implications for decision making in delimiting forest boundaries and core areas for protection in the development of management plans. We suggest possible remedial actions, appropriate repeatable methods for future monitoring and opportunities for community involvement in the management and conservation of the site. "
62,4010,Population density of the western burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) in Mexican prairie dog (Cynomys mexicanus) colonies in northeastern Mexico,"Background: The western burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) occurs throughout western North America; in various habitats such as desert, short-grass prairie and shrub-steppe, among others, where the main threat for this; species is habitat loss. Range-wide declines have prompted a need for reliable estimates of its populations in Mexico,; where the size of resident and migratory populations remain unknown.; Results: Our objective was to estimate the abundance and density of breeding western burrowing owl populations; in Mexican prairie dog (Cynomys mexicanus) colonies in two sites located within the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion in; the states of Nuevo Leon and San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Line transect surveys were conducted from February to April of; 2010 and 2011. Fifty 60 ha transects were analyzed using distance sampling to estimate owl and Mexican prairie dog; populations. We estimated a population of 2026 owls (95 % CI 17562336) in 2010 and 2015 owls (95 % CI 15732317); in 2011 across 50 Mexican prairie dog colonies (20,529 ha).; Conclusions: The results represent the first systematic attempt to provide reliable evidence related to the size of the; adult owl populations, within the largest and best preserved Mexican prairie dog colonies in Mexico."
63,2906,,"The Tunisian breeding population of White Stork Ciconia ciconia, originally found in the northwest of the country, is now present over nearly the whole northern part of Tunisia (records of the last 5 years). For this reason a particular attention was given to the population trend in order to find out if the new colonies resulted from a displacement of breeding pairs from the North-West region or was the result of an overall increase in numbers. 231 nests with young were recorded in 1998 and 303 in 1999. The species extended its breeding range towards the east and the south without notably increasing its breeding numbers. Records from three spring migrations (1990, 1991 and 1992) at El Haouaria (Cap Bon) were integrated to provide more information on the status of the species in Tunisia. The data show the importance of this central migration route between Africa and Europe. It appears that the strait between Tunisia and Sicily has been underestimated in the past for migration of large gliders such as White Storks and others."
64,4023,Deformities in cane toad (Bufo marinus) populations in Bermuda : Part 1. Frequencies and distribution of abnormalities,"Observations of abnormal adult cane toads (Bufo marinus) in Bermuda in 1998 prompted; surveys of the islands mature and newly metamorphosed populations from 1999 to 2003. External; examinations revealed eye and facial abnormalities, spinal and pelvic abnormalities, and a variety of; limbmalformations.Malformed toads were found in all nine of Bermudas parishes and the incidence; rate was high in both age classes. The annual abnormality frequencies were 19-30% for adults and; juveniles, and 16-24% formetamorphs.Annualmetamorph abnormality rates at particular ponds were; as high as 58%, and abnormality rates for particular cohorts were as high as 81%. The frequency; of hind limb abnormalities was significantly greater than that of forelimb abnormalities in both age; classes. Most eye and limb abnormalities were unilateral. The most common limb malformation was; brachydactyly, and few cutaneous fusions or examples of polymely were observed. Breeding sites; that were natural or artificial ponds in parks or nature reserves, or lined ponds on golf courses, had; significantly higher abnormality frequencies than lined or cement ponds in backyard settings. No; encysted Ribeiroia metacercariae were found in 80 malformed metamorphs collected from four sites; with high abnormality rates, suggesting that these parasiteswere not responsible for the malformations; observed. Frog embryo teratogenesis assays demonstrated that water and sediment extracts from; the same four breeding sites induced severe developmental malformations in B. marinus and three; other amphibian species. These data suggested that many B. marinus breeding sites in Bermuda are; potentially contaminated with developmental toxicants."
65,4243,"Abiotic triggers for sea and river lamprey spawning migration and juvenile outmigration in the River Rhine, Germany"," The activity patterns of migrating lampreys (sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus and river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis) are poorly understood. This study uses extensive screening data from the cooling water intake of a nuclear power plant on the River Rhine, Germany, gathered on 1308 days over 46 consecutive months between 2011 and 2014. More than 34,000 lampreys were retrieved, of which the great majority (99.9%) were outmigrating nonfeeding postmetamorphic individuals. The main factors controlling outmigration were season, water temperature and river discharge. The bulk of downstream migration was observed each year in spring at water temperatures between 9 and 12°C, with earlier migrations during significant discharge peaks between December and February. The migration activity of postmetamorphic individuals declined during summer and autumn, regardless of discharge. Turbidity increased the occurrence of postmetamorphic lampreys and supported diurnal migration, which accounted for nearly 20% of all lamprey records. In winter, outmigrating individuals of both species exhibited significantly longer body lengths than those detected during other seasons. Haematophagus postmetamorphic sea lampreys were also retrieved (n = 28) and represent the most upstream records of parasitically feeding sea lamprey detected thus far. Adult lampreys migrating upstream were found mainly in spring, but in very low numbers, indicating high prespawning mortalities. The study points to a challenging future for the protection of lampreys in this area: the long duration and the round-the-clock nature of the observed migration demand flexible solutions to realise safe operational windows for water intake stations and to minimise impacts on juvenile lampreys."
66,4604,The effects of wood on stream habitat and native fish assemblages in New Zealand,"Historic deforestation has deprived many river systems of their natural wood loadings. To study the effects of the loss of wood from waterways, a field trial was conducted in three small forested streams in New Zealand. The objectives were to (i) examine differences in fish assemblages among wooded pools (where wood provided cover), open pools and riffles and (ii) measure the effects of wood removal on channel morphology and fish assemblages. In the first part of the study, no significant differences were found in total fish density among the three habitats. However, total fish biomass was significantly higher in wooded pools (64% of total fish biomass) compared with open pools and riffles. Mean density and biomass of banded kokopu (Galaxias fasciatus) and mean biomass of longfin eel (Anguilla dieffenbachii) were highest in wooded pools, whereas the density and biomass of bluegill bully (Gobiomorphus hubbsi) and torrentfish (Cheimarrichthys fosteri) were highest in riffles. In the second part of the study, wood was removed from a 200-m section (treatment) in each stream, significantly reducing pool area and increasing the proportion of channel area and length in riffles. At the habitat scale, banded kokopu and large longfin eel were the two species mostly affected by wood removal. At the reach scale, banded kokopu biomass was significantly lower in the treatment sections. Although wooded pools were a small portion of total habitat, they provided important habitat for two of New Zealand's larger native fish taxa. "
67,3817,Recovery of a US endangered fish,"Background. More fish have been afforded US Endangered Species Act protection than any other vertebrate taxonomic group, and none has been designated as recovered. Shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) occupy large rivers and estuaries along the Atlantic coast of North America, and the species has been protected by the US Endangered Species Act since its enactment. Methodology/Principal Findings. Data on the shortnose sturgeon in the Hudson River (New York to Albany, NY, USA) were obtained from a 1970s population study, a population and fish distribution study we conducted in the late 1990s, and a fish monitoring program during the 1980s and 1990s. Population estimates indicate a late 1990s abundance of about 60,000 fish, dominated by adults. The Hudson River population has increased by more than 400% since the 1970s, appears healthy, and has attributes typical for a long-lived species. Our population estimates exceed the government and scientific population recovery criteria by more than 500%, we found a positive trend in population abundance, and key habitats have remained intact despite heavy human river use. Conclusions/Significance. Scientists and legislators have called for changes in the US Endangered Species Act, the Act is being debated in the US Congress, and the Act has been characterized as failing to recover species. Recovery of the Hudson River population of shortnose sturgeon suggests the combination of species and habitat protection with patience can yield successful species recovery, even near one of the worlds largest human population centers."
68,3986,"Increased mammalian predators and climate change predict declines in breeding success and density of Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, an old stand specialist, in fragmented Scottish forests","Low breeding success has been associated with declines in population and range; of the re-introduced Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus in Scotland. Annual breeding success; from 26 Scottish forests surveyed between 1991 and 2009 averaged only 0.6 chicks per; female, the lowest rate recorded in 16 previous studies. Reduced breeding success was due; to proportionally fewer females rearing chicks rather than a reduction in brood size. Birds; bred less well in Perthshire at the southern edge of the range, where declines in indices of; female and male density were highest. Only at the core of the range (Strathspey), where; birds bred better, were female densities stable. Two weather variables, April temperature in; the pre-breeding period (APRTEMP), and temperature at chick hatch in June (HATCHTEMP),; increased over the study period. Indices of Pine Marten Martes martes increased; 3.9-fold since 1995, and those of Red Fox Vulpes vulpes by 2.2-fold, whereas those of; Carrion Crow Corvus corone, raptors and forest floor vegetation showed no change.; Neither forest type nor forest ground vegetation appeared to influence breeding success.; Instead, females reared more chicks in years when hatch time in June was drier, and in forests with lower marten and crow indices. In addition, more females reared broods in; years when Aprils were cooler. Brood size was unaffected by any of the measured variables.; Densities of adult birds were lower in forests with higher fox indices. Increased; predation of clutches and chicks by martens and crows within these small, fragmented; forests, as well as changes in climate, may explain reductions in breeding success and; hence contribute to continued declines. Successful conservation of Capercaillie in; remaining Strathspey strongholds may require better predator management, including a; licensed removal of martens to test the hypotheses that martens contribute to reduced; breeding success. This short-medium term approach will inform longer-term predator; management policies and complement aspirations to increase the area and connectivity of; forest habitat to benefit Capercaillie in-part through mitigating against any impact of; increasing forest-edge predators."
69,2140,Exploitation and conservation of angling fish in two South African estuaries,"1. Recreational and subsistence angling in South African estuaries is a small, but relevant, sector of South Africa's diverse coastal fisheries. This paper reviews these fisheries and their effects in two estuaries. 2. The composition of angler's catches in two large Eastern Cape Province estuaries has hardly changed over a period of nearly 20 years. 3. Gill-net catches (in terms of CPUE) indicate a decline in the abundance of the most popular angling fish species, especially the spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii. 4. Regular freshwater inputs into estuaries are required to ensure a salinity gradient which is crucial for the maintenance of an abundant and diverse estuarine ichthyofaunal assemblage. 5. Present management and conservation policies are poorly defined, and the philosophy and principles of ecosystem preservation, rather than that of species preservation, should be seriously considered."
70,3227,Rapid population decline in red knots: fitness consequences of decreased refuelling rates and late arrival in Delaware Bay,"Most populations of migrant shorebirds around the world are in serious decline, suggesting that vital; condition-dependent rates such as fecundity and annual survival are being affected globally. A striking; example is the red knot (Calidris canutus rufa) population wintering in Tierra del Fuego, which undertakes; marathon 30 000 km hemispheric migrations annually. In spring, migrant birds forage voraciously on; horseshoe crab eggs in Delaware Bay in the eastern USA before departing to breed in Arctic polar deserts.; From 1997 to 2002 an increasing proportion of knots failed to reach threshold departure masses of; 180200 g, possibly because of later arrival in the Bay and food shortage from concurrent over-harvesting; of crabs. Reduced nutrient storage, especially in late-arriving birds, possibly combined with reduced sizes; of intestine and liver during refuelling, had severe fitness consequences for adult survival and recruitment; of young in 20002002. From 1997 to 2002 known survivors in Delaware Bay were heavier at initial; capture than birds never seen again, annual survival of adults decreased by 37% between May 2000 and; May 2001, and the number of second-year birds in wintering flocks declined by 47%. Population size in; Tierra del Fuego declined alarmingly from 51 000 to 27 000 in 20002002, seriously threatening the; viability of this subspecies. Demographic modelling predicts imminent endangerment and an increased; risk of extinction of the subspecies without urgent risk-averse management."
71,3503,Low abundance and probable decline of the critically endangered Maui's dolphin estimated by genotype capture-recapture,"The New Zealand endemic Maui's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori maui) is considered 'critically endangered' by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as a result of decline due, in part, to fisheries-related mortalities. To estimate the abundance and trends of this subspecies, we used open-population capture-recapture models based on microsatellite genotyping of living and beachcast (dead) dolphins sampled between January 2001 and November 2007. A total of 82 genetic samples were available: 70 biopsy samples collected from living Maui's dolphins and 12 necropsy samples collected from beachcast or floating carcasses, of which five showed evidence of fisheries entanglement. Microsatellite genotyping of up to 14 loci identified 54 individuals; 42 sampled alive on one or more occasions, one sampled alive, then found beachcast 2 years later, and 11 sampled only as carcasses, including two neonates. The sex ratio of the sample did not differ significantly from unity (25 males: 29 females). Using a POPAN model for live capture records, the abundance of the super population available during the multiyear study was estimated to be N=87 [95% (confidence limits) CL, 59-158]. Using a Pradel-like model modified to include both live capture and beachcast records, the abundance of the population was estimated to be N=69 (95% CL, 38-125) for the midpoint of the study in 2003. The results of both models suggested that the population was likely to be declining across the study period, although this trend could not be confirmed with 95% confidence. As the genotypes provide permanent marks of individual identity, continued genetic monitoring could provide improved confidence in the abundance and trends of this subspecies. "
72,4032,Population dynamics of Dromiciops gliroides (Microbiotheriidae) in an austral temperate forest,"Dromiciops gliroides is an arboreal marsupial endemic to the southern temperate forest located between 36°S and 43°S in both Chile and Argentina. This species is a key seed disperser of many native plants, including the keystone mistletoe, Tristerix corymbosus. We studied the population fluctuation of D. gliroides and the possible effects of natural disturbances on the population. We estimated density, abundance, survival, and recruitment ratios for 7 years (2009-2011 and 2013-2016) at Reserva Llao Llao, Argentina, using capture-recapture techniques. A Jolly-Seber model with robust design was fitted using a hierarchical Bayesian approach. The estimated mean abundance during these 7 years was 81 individuals. The highest abundances were observed in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2014 (98 individuals on average). The years with lowest abundance were 2013, 2015, and 2016 (60 individuals on average), which coincided with the occurrence of natural disturbances in the study area (eruption of the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcano, the flowering of Chusquea bamboo and a subsequent rodent outbreak, and an unusually dry summer). These results suggest that the observed population fluctuations of D. gliroides could be related to natural forest disturbances."
73,1084,Thirty-year recovery trend in the once depleted Hawaiian green sea turtle stock,"The green sea turtle is one of the long-lived species that comprise the charismatic marine megafauna. The green turtle has a long history of human exploitation with some stocks extinct. Here we report on a 30-year study of the nesting abundance of the green turtle stock endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago. We show that there has been a substantial long-term increase in abundance of this once seriously depleted stock following cessation of harvesting since the 1970s. This population increase has occurred in a far shorter period of time than previously thought possible. There was also a distinct 3-4 year periodicity in annual nesting abundance that might be a function of regional environmental stochasticity that synchronises breeding behaviour throughout the Archipelago. This is one of the few reliable long-term population abundance time series for a large long-lived marine species, which are needed for gaining insights into the recovery process of long-lived marine species and long-term ecological processes.

74,4310,Turkey as a crossroad for Greater Flamingos Phoenicopterus roseus: evidence from population trends and ring-resightings (Aves: Phoenicopteridae),"The Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus is a waterbird commonly found in saline and brackish lagoons throughout the Mediterranean Region. We have gathered existing data on Greater Flamingos in Turkey and carried out field surveys to present the most up to date information on wintering (1999-2014) and breeding (1969-2014). The wintering population of flamingos shows an increasing trend with 54,947±20,794 individuals mainly concentrated in the Gediz, Buyuk Menderes and Çukurova deltas, respectively. Breeding attempts were recorded in at least seven wetlands in Turkey in the past, yet after 1999 most of the colonies were abandoned due to basin scale intensive water management practices in Central Anatolia. Currently, only Tuz Lake and Gediz Delta are used as regular breeding sites, while breeding has been recorded sporadically in Acigol and Akşehir Lakes. The breeding colony of Tuz Lake is of prime importance at the Mediterranean scale, with the number of young chicks in 2011, 2012 and 2013 accounting for the highest number of fledglings in the Mediterranean Region and West Africa (18,418, 20,274 and 20,292 respectively). Finally, building upon the previous findings about Turkey and the western Mediterranean metapopulation links, recent resightings of Turkish flamingos (despite the limited numbers) confirm post-fledging and natal dispersal reaching the western Mediterranean Basin and West Africa. Flamingos from Turkey were also found to disperse to Israel and to a region outside the known flyways of the western Mediterranean and West African flamingos (i.e. to Israel and UAE). Thus, Turkey, due to its geographic position, appears to be a crossroad between the western and eastern Mediterranean Region and southwest Asia."
75,4521,Population ecology and life history strategy of a montane lizard (Sceloporus scalaris) in southeastern Arizona,"Populations of Sceloporus scalaris were studied in the Chiricahua Mountains of Southeastern Arizona from 1973-1976. Reproductive maturity occurs in approximately 8 months. A single clutch of eggs is produced, averaging 5·9 eggs in yearlings and approximately 10 eggs in older females. There was no significant variation in clutch size among years and clutch size varied with body size. Females tended to outnumber males up to as much as 2:1. Mortality varied from year to year but averaged about 0·7 in hatchlings, 0·5 in yearlings and 0·7 in adults. Animals are active in all months of the year and the long growing season permits early maturity. Approximately 44% of the lifetime fertility results from the first reproduction. "
76,3048,"Comparison of abundance and habitat usage for common bottlenose dolphins between sites exposed to differential anthropogenic stressors within the estuaries of southern Georgia, U.S.A.","The health of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) within southern Georgia estuaries is of particular concern due to high levels of anthropogenic contaminants in their tissues. Dolphins in this region have the highest polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations recorded for any marine mammal and these concentrations correlate to distance from a Superfund point-source in the Turtle/Brunswick River Estuary (TBRE). Currently, little is known about the population structure of dolphins in this region. This study identifies and compares baseline data on abundance, habitat use, site-fidelity, and ranging patterns of dolphins across two adjacent field sites; Brunswick, including the TBRE, and Sapelo, including the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Sapelo is relatively undeveloped and was selected for comparison to the more contaminated TBRE. Dolphin densities increased with tributary size in both sites but dolphin density and total abundance were significantly higher in Sapelo than in Brunswick. Anthropogenic stressors within the TBRE may be an important factor contributing to the differences in abundance, density, and habitat use observed in this study."
77,726,The 1995 Peregrine Falcon survey in Canada,"During 1995, provincial/territorial/federal wildlife agency personnel and volunteers conducted the sixth Canada-wide Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus survey. This survey covered the largest number of anatum populations to date and resulted in a larger number of occupied anatum territories and territorial anatum pairs than found in any of the previous surveys. The largest increases took place in Ontario and in central and southern Alberta, where mass reintroductions of captive-raised young had occurred yearly since 1992. North of 58°N, the Mackenzie Valley and Yukon River populations had average annual growth rates indicating stability. These are the largest and longest surveyed populations in Canada. Although the Southern Lakes population of the Yukon Territory disappeared during the 1970s, a pair reoccupied a historic (known) site in 1995 and successfully fledged three young. The northern Alberta population, which had an average annual growth rate of 21%, has been managed since 1975, and surveys of additional nesting habitats resulted in five new territories. South of 58°N, the British Columbia anatum population has recovered. In central and southern Alberta, 12 pairs occupied sites, but only three pairs successfully fledged young. In Saskatchewan, two pairs reoccupied the two known city sites in Regina and Saskatoon and successfully fledged young. Similarly, in Manitoba, four pairs occupied city sites in Winnipeg and Brandon, but only two pairs successfully fledged young. The Ontario population reoccupied seven historic (known) sites in addition to eight new sites, and 10 pairs successfully fledged young. In southern Quebec, pairs occupied 13 sites and singles two sites. Ten pairs successfully fledged young. In the Maritimes, five sites in New Brunswick and one site in Nova Scotia were occupied. This latter site was the first site occupied by a territorial pair in Nova Scotia in over 40 years. In Labrador, peregrines reoccupied 20 of 31 known sites, and surveys of additional nesting habitats located 11 new sites. Within the tundrius populations, the Yukon North Slope population may be experiencing a recovery from its demise in 1970. Only a single adult was seen in 1990, but surveys between 1990 and 1995 located four occupied territories. During the 1995 survey, an additional occupied territory was found. In the Northwest Territories, which included Nunavut, populations appear stable. Coastal pealei Populations in British Columbia, including Langara Island, appear stable."
78,1929,"Population decline of northern dusky salamanders at Acadia National Park, Maine, USA","We investigated and reviewed the current and historic distribution of northern dusky salamanders (Desmognathus fuscus fuscus) in Acadia National Park (ANP), Maine, USA during 1938-2003. Historical data indicate that northern dusky salamanders were once widespread and common in ANP. We conducted intensive surveys for stream salamanders during 20002003 and observed only two adult northern dusky salamanders on one stream. No eggs or larvae were observed. Although the cause of the observed population decline is unknown, we identify multiple potential stressors including stocking of predatory fishes, fungal pathogens, substrate embeddedness, and widespread pollution (i.e., from atmospheric pollutants) of surface waters at ANP. Our data suggest that ANP streams may no longer be suitable for northern dusky salamanders. This investigation is the first to document the decline of a stream dwelling amphibian species in a national park (i.e., areas that are not subject to obvious habitat loss or major changes in land use) with widespread mercury contamination of its surface waters.

79,2097,"Stock assessment of the big-eye grunt (Brachydeuterus auritus, Val.) fishery in Ghanaian coastal waters","Annual fishery catch statistics and length data series for Brachydeuterus auritus (Val.) in coastal waters off Ghana for the periods 1974-1997 and 1990-1991 were used to model the growth, mortality rates, indices of abundance and exploitation patterns. Mean population parameters were L[infinity]=23.1 cm (fork length), Lm=13.7 cm, K=0.73 yr-1, Z=2.67 yr-1, M=1.24 yr-1 and F=1.43 yr-1. Yield per recruit analysis showed that excessive fishing effort was being exerted on stocks and a very low length at first capture was observed. Corrective measures are recommended with emphasis on co-operation between fishermen and the government in the decision-making process."
80,3785,Recent status and population decline of the Great Bustard Otis tarda in Iran,"The current distribution and recent population trends of the Great Bustard ( Otis tarda ) in Iran were investigated based on a literature review and unpublished data (19952008) followed by three years of census (20092011) in areas where the species is still breeding. Results suggest that Great Bustards have disappeared from a large part of their former distribution in the country, including East Azarbayjan, Hamedan and Kurdistan provinces. The surviving groups are concentrated in West Azarbayjan where numbers are rapidly declining. The present population is estimated at about 4348 birds in 2011, confirming a marked decline compared to the 200300 birds estimated in the early 1990s. About 8090% of the extant birds are concentrated in the plains of Boukan. Strict conservation measures are urgently needed to prevent the extinction of this species in Iran."
81,2604,Trends in western Ross Sea emperor penguin chick abundances and their relationships to climate,"The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is extremely dependent on the extent and stability of sea ice, which may make the species particularly susceptible to environmental change. In order to appraise the stability of the emperor penguin populations at six colonies in the western Ross Sea, we used linear regression analysis to evaluate chick abundance trends (1983-2005) and Pearson's r correlation to assess their relation to two local and two large-scale climate variables. We detected only one significant abundance trend; the Cape Roget colony increased from 1983 to 1996 (n = 6). Higher coefficients of variation in chick abundances at smaller colonies (Cape Crozier, Beaufort Island, Franklin Island) suggest that such colonies occupy marginal habitat, and are more susceptible to environmental change. We determined chick abundance to be most often correlated with local Ross Sea climate variables (sea ice extent and sea surface temperature), but not in consistent patterns across the colonies. We propose that chick abundance is most impacted by fine scale sea ice extent and local weather events, which are best evaluated by on-site assessments. We did not find sufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis that the overall emperor penguin population in the Ross Sea was stable during this period. "
82,2901,"Population decline of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) on Deception Island, South Shetlands, Antarctica","Population changes of top predators can provide key indications of environmental quality. In the Antarctic ecosystem, population dynamics of top predators like penguins may yield important information about how the environment is changing. From 1991-1992 to 2008-2009 censuses of the chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), breeding population of Vapour Col in Deception Island (South Shetlands Islands) were carried out. Censuses were conducted on 19 sub-colonies, mainly in December around the time of peak hatching. Nest counts were taken from photographs that were recorded from a standard location. Some censuses were also made in mid-January in 1999, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Our results reveal that the population has declined by 36 % when comparing data from 1991 with those from 2008. The strongest decline occurred since 2000. No temporal trends were detected in reproductive success. Declines of Chinstrap penguin populations constitute a general pattern in the South Shetlands, and it has been suggested to be related to climate change through effects of reduction in sea-ice extent during winter and a consequent decline in the abundance of krill. "
83,2499,Population dynamics of the White Stork Ciconia ciconia in western France,"Population dynamics of the White Stork Ciconia ciconia were studied in Charente-Maritime, France from 1978 to 1996, during which time the number of breeding pairs increased from one to 44. Modal age at first return and first breeding were 2.4 and 3.4 years, respectively. White Storks produced an average of 3.2 fledglings per nest. The average number of fledglings per nest decreased with increasing nest density, probably because of an increase in the number of interactions between breeding birds. Nests surrounded by marshes had slightly greater productivity than nests on peripheral sites. Individual White Storks followed an annual breeding cycle and attempted to breed in 97% of seasons once mature. Nest-site and mate fidelity were high (88 and 83%, respectively). Immigration rate was nearly twice that of emigration during the last few years of the study and recruitment was close to 30%, although underestimated. We modelled survival and recapture probabilities using capture-mark-recapture methods. Adult survival was found to be dependent on age, but not sex. Survival of younger birds varied greatly over the years, whereas survival of older birds was relatively constant and averaged 78%. Survival rates of young birds wintering in the Sahel zone were positively linked to the amount of rainfall in their wintering area. The proximate reason for the population increase was probably immigration of birds from other European countries, probably encouraged by a high adult survival rate. Ringing recoveries indicate that some birds winter in Spain and the high adult survival rate may reflect a change in migratory pattern in recent years. Finally, reproductive success was relatively high during the study."
84,2156,Current status and temporal trends in stocks of European eel in England and Wales,"An extensive 4-year programme of catchment surveys, data collection, and model development for eels was undertaken to establish the status of the stocks in England and Wales, so that appropriate management action can be taken. Nine test catchments representing different geographical areas and catchment types were studied, covering 14 rivers, two estuaries, and a fresh-water lagoon. Data were collected via electric fishing, fykenetting, fixed eel racks, and elver traps. In all, 13 500 eels were caught, weighed, and measured, and the sex and age of a subsample of 1400 determined. Despite declining recruitment, eel stocks in some, perhaps many, west coast rivers are probably still at or near to carrying capacity, with male-dominated populations. In other rivers, particularly those towards the southeast of England, current and historical data indicate declining female-dominated stocks. For rivers where recruitment is not limiting, there appears to be a direct relationship between the standing stock of eels and the mean nitrate level. This relationship potentially facilitates the application of a biomass-based biological reference point for eels for application to individual catchments. The data also suggest that it may be possible to develop reference points based on mean eel length or sex ratio. "
85,2650,Temporal variation in tiger (Panthera tigris) populations and its implications for monitoring,"Tigers (Panthera tigris) are endangered wild felids whose elusive nature and naturally low densities make them notoriously difficult to count. We present 7 years of camera trapping, tracking, and observational data on a local tiger population in Chitwan National Park, Nepal, to quantify changes in abundance of demographic groups and to identify underlying causes. Mean abundance in the 100-km2 study area was 18 tigers, but there was high variance among years. Transients were generally recorded at low levels, but there were large oscillations in numbers of tiger offspring, driven by infanticide perpetrated by male tigers taking over territories. The number of breeding animals in the study area remained relatively stable, with about 6 breeding females and 1 or 2 breeding males. The high density of breeding adults in Chitwan National Park highlights the region as a potential stronghold for tigers. Concentrating on counting breeding animals increases the power of monitoring programs to detect change over time. An alternative approach is to carry out surveys on a scale large enough to encompass sufficient territories to compensate for the local impacts of periodic turnover of adult males on total abundance."
86,2092,Abundance and population density of cetaceans in the California Current ecosystem,"The abundance and population density of cetaceans along the U.S. west coast were estimated from ship surveys conducted in the summer and fall of 1991, 1993, 1996, 2001, and 2005 by using multiple-covariate, line-transect analyses. Overall, approximately 556,000 cetaceans of 21 species were estimated to be in the 1,141,800-km2 study area. Delphinoids (Delphinidae and Phocoenidae), the most abundant group, numbered [approximately]540,000 individuals. Abundance in other taxonomic groups included [approximately]5800 baleen whales (Mysticeti), [approximately]7000 beaked whales (Ziphiidae), and [approximately]3200 sperm whales (Physeteridae). This study provides the longest time series of abundance estimates that includes all the cetacean species in any marine ecosystem. These estimates will be used to interpret the impacts of human-caused mortality (such as that documented in fishery bycatch and that caused by ship strikes and other means) and to evaluate the ecological role of cetaceans in the California Current ecosystem."
87,1161,First estimates of Vaquita Abundance,"The abundance of the only population of vaquitas, Gulf of California harbor porpoise (Phocoena sinus), is estimated from four surveys conducted in Mexico between 1986 and 1993, using a variety of methods. A line-transect approach was applied, using some parameters estimated from a related species, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Vaquita abundance is estimated as 503 (CV = 0.63) from 1986-1988 boat surveys, 885 (CV = 0.50) from 19881989 aerial surveys, 572 (CV = 1.43) from a 1991 aerial survey, and 224 (CV = 0.39) from a 1993 ship survey. A weighted log-linear regression indicates a rate of population change (decline) of -17.7% per year (95% CI = -43.2% to +19.3%) between 1986 and 1993. All of these estimates of vaquita abundance indicate that the species is at a critically low level."
88,2803,The numbers and distribution patterns of large mammals in the Ruaha-Rungwa area of southern Tanzania,"An aerial census of Ruaha National Park, Rungwa and Kizigo Game Reserves, and part of the proposed Mloa-Ilambi Game Controlled Area is described. Zebra, eland, sable and hartebeest were virtually restricted to the miombo woodlands. Impala and kudu were most common in the rift valley sector of the census zone. Elephants, buffalo and giraffe occurred throughout the entire area. The 31,500 km2 census zone carried 1 of the largest elephant populations in Africa, an estimated 43,685 .+-. 9254 elephants, of which 24,625 .+-. 7132 were estimated to occur within Ruah National Park (10,200 km2 in area). The densities of elephants and the combined densities of the other large herbivores were highest in the National Park and lowest in the Game Controlled Area. Within the National Park, comparisons with earlier counts showed an apparent increase in elephant density of 8-10% per annum since 1965. Of the large herbivores, elephants alone showed a significant increase since the 1972 census and only elephant distribution was significantly affected by the distribution of human and hunting. The increase in elephant numbers within the National Park is probably the result of the change in human distribution in the region and a period of higher rainfall."
89,2330,Changes in the Ruaha elephant population caused by poaching,Found‐ivory records complement the information provided by aerial surveys to illustrate changes in the Ruaha elephant population between 1973 and 1988. Intense poaching in the late 1970s and early 1980s reduced the numbers of elephants by about 60% and also distorted the age structure of the survivors. There are now few cows > 34 years and few bulls > 16 years. Footprint measurements in 1989 showed a lack of calves aged 2 to 9 years but many new‐born infants. 
90,1990,"Diversity and Seasonal Changes in the Ichthyofauna of Rocky Tidal Pools from Praia Vermelha and São Roque, Santa Catarina","A survey of the tidal pool fish community was carried out between April 1998 and May 1999, at the beaches of Praia Vermelha (PV) and São Roque (SR), Santa Catarina, Brazil. The pool of PV was bigger and closer to the subtidal. Specimens were collected monthly at low tide, using quinaldine. In PV we collected 1287 fish belonging to 19 species and in SR 553 fish were caught corresponding to 11 species. In both pools, dominant species were Bathygobius soporator (Gobiidae), Abudefduf saxatilis (Pomacentridae), Parablennius pilicornis (Blenniidae), Gobiesox barbatulus (Gobiesocidae), Labrisomus nuchipinnis (Labrisomidae) and Epinephelus marginatus (Serranidae). Summer months had higher abundance and diversity values, and correspond to a recruitment season for both A. saxatilis and E. marginatus."
91,3010,Changes in fish assemblages following 10 years of protection in Tasmanian marine protected areas,"Most studies examining effects of marine protected areas (MPAs) on fish assemblages are potentially confounded, either; because they are once off comparisons between fished and unfished locations, or because they are snapshot studies over a fixed; period. Here we compare long-term changes within fully protected Tasmanian marine reserves with changes at external reference; sites on an annual basis over the first ten years of protection. The results highlight the importance of long-term datasets for; differentiating changes occurring over differing time scales. Notable results include a statistically significant increase in abundance; of Latridopsis forsteri and large fish (N300 mm) when examined across all reserves relative to controls, and a 10-fold increase in; the abundance of large fish and a doubling of per site species richness of large fish within the Tinderbox Marine Reserve relative to; controls. Short-term resident species that recruit sporadically show very different patterns in reserves compared to those that recruit; regularly and have long-term age-class storage. While several recent reviews have suggested size of MPAs and duration of; protection has little influence on the extent of recovery, our results suggest this is not the case and that responses can be slow,; complex and species-specific. The extent of localised fishing pressure appeared to have a substantial influence on the degree of; change detected, potentially confounding meta-analyses of recovery rates in MPAs if overlooked as a relevant parameter."
92,3080,"Recent establishments and extinctions of Northern Gannet Morus bassanus colonies in North Norway, 1995-2008","Since the last published review of the development of the Northern Gannet Morus bassanus population in Norway (Barrett & Folkestad 1996), there has been a general increase in numbers breeding in North Norway from ca. 2200 occupied nests in 1995 to ca. 2700 in 2008. In Lofoten and Vesterålen, however, numbers have decreased from 1500 occupied nests in 1989 to 500 in 2008, and what were the two largest colonies on Skarvklakken and Hovsflesa have been abandoned. Small colonies have, in the meantime, been established in the region, but these are all characteristically unstable. A new colony established in Troms in 2001 increased to 400 occupied sites in 2007, but the population dropped to 326 in 2008. Harassment by White-tailed eagles Haliaeetus albicilla is mooted as the main cause of the decline in Lofoten and Vesterålen."
93,3652,Patterns of occurrence of reptiles across a sand dune landscape,"Identifying variables that drive population dynamics is a critical component of conservation and guides decisions for maintaining sustainable populations. Our objective was to model spatial and temporal patterns of occurrence of reptiles across an aeolian sand landscape. We used a community framework based on dune geomorphology and wind-precipitation gradients to identify variables that explain patterns of reptile abundance. We found that although population dynamics in arid environments are typically correlated with precipitation, in some instances that pattern was weak or absent. Strong precipitation-related abundance patterns were found with Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizards (Uma inornata), and zebra-tailed lizards (Callisaurus draconoides). The strength of that relationship varied along a precipitation gradient. We found weak or no precipitation relationships with long-lived, territorial species such as desert iguanas (Dipsosaurus dorsalis) and with species foraging on detritivore insects which appeared to not correlate with rainfall. In addition to precipitation our analyses allowed us to identify the influences of sand compaction, shrub density and exotic plant species, and how they varied between species and communities. Our approach broke down the inherent landscape complexity into tractable units that yielded information directly applicable to land managers and to the conservation of the species that comprise these communities.

94,4564,"Roles of discharge and temperature in recruitment of a cold-water fish, the European grayling Thymallus thymallus, near its southern range limit"," Recruitment of salmonids is a result of density-dependent factors, specifically egg production in the previous year, and density-independent environmental processes driven by discharge and temperature. With the plethora of knowledge on major drivers of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta recruitment, there is a requirement to explore less known species, such as European grayling Thymallus thymallus, whose postemergence time coincides with period of increasing temperature and low discharge. This study assessed drivers of grayling recruitment in a southern English chalk stream, a system vulnerable to discharge and temperature alterations under future climate change predictions. The analyses explored age 0+ grayling survival in relation to conspecific and heterospecific densities and discharge- and temperature-derived factors. The final mixed-effects model revealed a positive relationship between age 0+ grayling survival and incubation temperature anomaly and age 0+ trout abundance. Similarly, postincubation temperature anomaly had a positive effect on 0+ grayling survival, but only up to a threshold temperature of 13.5°C, beyond which it had a negative effect. In contrast, increasing number of days with low discharge postincubation negatively influenced age 0+ grayling survival, with no evidence of an effect of elevated discharges following spawning. Our results emphasise the importance of maintaining natural discharge regimes in salmonid rivers by tackling multiple stressors operating at the catchment scale, including land and water use to mitigate for predicted climate driven changes. In addition, further research on recruitment drivers in less stable, rain-fed systems, is required."
95,3047,Abundance and species richness of snakes along the middle Rio Grande riparian forest in New Mexico,"To understand the effects of removal of non-native plants and fuels on wildlife in the riparian forest of the Middle Rio Grande in New Mexico, we monitored snakes from 2000 to 2006 using trap arrays of drift fences, pitfalls, and funnel traps. We recorded 158 captures of 13 species of snakes from 12 study sites. We captured more snakes in funnel traps than in pitfalls. The most frequent captures were Common Kingsnakes (Lampropeltis getula), Gopher Snakes (Pituophis catenifer), Plains Black-headed Snakes (Tantilla nigriceps), and Plains Hog-nosed Snakes (Heterodon nasicus). We did not detect an effect of non-native plants and fuels removal on the rate of captures; however, we recommend using other trapping and survey techniques to monitor snakes to better determine the impact of plant removal on the snake community. Compared to historical records, we did not report any new species but we did not capture all snakes previously recorded. Black-necked Gartersnakes (Thamnophis cyrtopsis), which are closely tied to aquatic habitats, were not captured during our study; possibly indicating the loss of off-channel semi-aquatic habitats along the Middle Rio Grande."
96,3647,Invasive woody plants affect the composition of native lizard and small mammal communities in riparian woodlands,"Nonnative Tamarix spp. (saltcedar) is among the most invasive and common trees along riparian habitats in the western U S, impacting native plant communities and habitat quality. Tamarix dominance causes a reduction in habitat physiognomic heterogeneity in riparian habitats. Animal abundance, diversity and habitat associations in monotypic stands of saltcedar remain largely unexplored for non-avian communities. We sampled small vertebrate and ground arthropod communities in monotypic Tamarix stands and in mixed stands of Tamarix and native (Populus, Salix, and Prosopis spp.) trees in riparian habitats along the Virgin River in the Mojave Desert. Our survey of faunal communities suggests that many species of arthropods, reptiles and small mammals utilize both Tamarix-dominated and mixed habitats along the Virgin River. Small mammal and lizard communities were dominated by generalist species. Mixed stands had greater arthropod abundance, lizard abundance and small mammal diversity; whereas, monotypic and mixed stands had similar lizard diversity. The habitat of mixed sites was characterized by 'nativeness' (areas with native riparian trees) and less 'shady exotic thickets' (areas with Tamarix and high overstory cover) compared to Tamarix-dominated stands. There were species-specific responses to habitat physiognomy. Peromyscus maniculatus (deer mouse) was associated with shady exotic thickets. Sceloporus magister (desert spiny lizard) and Neotoma lepida (desert woodrat) were associated with native trees and woody debris. Seven rodent and lizard species' abundances were explained by habitat physiognomy variables. Rare and specialist species were more impacted by nonnative vegetation. These results contribute to the body of research on animal utilization of nonnative habitats and relation to habitat physiognomy. Management of nonnative plants should consider how control activities could impact habitat physiognomy and native animal communities in riparian habitat. "
97,967,Bird Population Changes for Years 1974-75,"Many resident birds are now maintaining higher population levels than was the case during the first ten years of the CBC, but some summer visitors are much less common. However, the decline in Redstart and Sedge Warbler seems to have halted. "
98,4138,Inferring shark population trends from generalized linear mixed models of pelagic longline catch and effort data,"We estimate recent (1992-2005) trends in relative abundance for Northwest Atlantic oceanic and large coastal sharks, using generalized linear mixed models to standardize catch rates of eight species groups as recorded by U.S. pelagic longline fishery observers. Models suggest precipitous (76%) declines in hammerhead (Sphyrna species) and large coastal (dusky, night, and silky shark, genus Carcharhinus) species, and moderate declines (53%) in blue and oceanic whitetip sharks over this period. In contrast, mako and thresher sharks appear to have stabilized, and the tiger shark population appears to be increasing. A comparison of nominal shark catch rates from this fleet's observer and logbook data (to evaluate the veracity of trends previously estimated from the latter) showed a high degree of concordance for each species group, both in individual sub-areas and overall. Models of these two datasets for the common time period (1992-2000) show that compared to the observer data the logbook data indicate greater declines for some species, but lesser declines for others. Signs of recovery for some shark species are encouraging, but must also be set in the context of the significant declines that occurred in previous decades. "
99,1739,Collapse and conservation of shark populations in the northwest Atlantic,"Overexploitation threatens the future of many large vertebrates. In the ocean, tunas and sea turtles are current conservation concerns because of this intense pressure. The status of most shark species, in contrast, remains uncertain. Using the largest data set in the Northwest Atlantic, we show rapid large declines in large coastal and oceanic shark populations. Scalloped hammerhead, white, and thresher sharks are each estimated to have declined by over 75% in the past 15 years. Closed-area models highlight priority areas for shark conservation, and the need to consider effort reallocation and site selection if marine reserves are to benefit multiple threatened species."
100,1520,North Atlantic right whale habitat in the lower Bay of Fundy and on the SW Scotian Shelf during 1999–2001.,"Simultaneous visual and oceanographic surveys were conducted in the lower Bay of Fundy and in Roseway Basin of the SW Scotian Shelf during the summers of 1999 to 2001 to investigate the physical and biological oceanographic factors associated with North Atlantic right whale occurrence. Sightings of right whales were recorded along predetermined transects through each region, while both in situ and remotely sensed oceanographic measurements were collected. Sampling with plankton nets and an optical plankton counter confirmed that right whales in these regions feed on Calanus finmarchicus copepodite stage 5 (C5). Spatial variability in right whale occurrence was associated with water depth and the depth of the bottom mixed layer. C. finmarchicus C5 aggregated over the deepest water depths in both regions, and within these areas, right whales occurred where the bottom mixed layer forced discrete layers of C. finmarchicus C5 to occur shallower in the water column (allowing more efficient foraging). Annual increases in right whale occurrence appeared to be associated with decreases in sea surface temperature (SST) in both regions; however, this observation merits caution in light of the short duration of the study (3 yr). There was also evidence to suggest that both spatial and interannual variability in right whale occurrence in Roseway Basin may be associated with SST gradient, a proxy for ocean fronts."
101,2996,"The population dynamics of red and western grey kangaroos in arid New South Wales, Australia. I. Population trends and rainfall","Red kangaroo Macropus rufus and western grey kangaroo M. fuliginosa populations were monitored on Kinchega National Park and some adjoining sheep stations. 1973-1976 experienced exceptionally high rainfall providing kangaroos with a superabundance of food. The preceding years were marked by the late 1960's drought and low kangaroo densities, and the following years by average rainfall and high kangaroo densities. The kangaroo populations exhibited two general trends in relation to the exceptional and average rainfall years: a rapid rise and an asymptote. There was no significant difference between the population dynamics of the kangaroos inside the Park and on the adjoining sheep stations, regardless of densitites being 2.5 times higher on the Park. Competition for food by sheep Ovis aries probably suppressed kangaroo densities outside the Park. The exponential rate of increase of all populations was positively correlated with lagged rainfall.-from Author"
102,1960,The effect of annual water level management on population trends of white crappie in Elk City Reservoir,"To improve a marginal white crappie (Pomoxis annularis) sport fishery in a 1,800 hectare Kansas reservoir, a management plan for water level manipulation was devised to increase the population.The essence of the plan was to increase the water area during the spawning season to stimulate natural reproduction, while flooded vegetation increased the amount of spawning habitat. The effect of this procedure was significantly (P0.05) related to an increase in the relative year-class strengths of white crappie during a 5-year period, as compared to year-class indices measured 5 years previously. However, the hectare-days of flooded vegetation during the spawning season were not significantly related to the increase in crappie numbers, but may have been overshadowed by environmental conditions that limited reproduction or recruitment of the white crappie. Fluctuations in water levels during the crappie spawning season had a significant (P0.05) but negative relationship on crappie year-class strengths. Also, floodwater releases were negatively correlated with year-class strengths at the 0.001 level of significance. Water level management can be an effective management tool when unregulated conditions severely restrict crappie reproduction and recruitment. "
103,3411,Changes in the population ecology of hatchery and wild Coho salmon in the Strait of Georgia,"An analysis of the results of a 10-year study of the population ecology of juvenile hatchery and wild coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch in the Strait of Georgia produced new information about the interannual and interseasonal fluctuations in abundance and marine survival. A decline in the percentage of hatchery coho salmon was related to declines in hatchery fish abundance and marine survival; wild coho salmon abundance was more stable. The declining marine survival of hatchery coho salmon appeared to be related to a fixed average date of release from hatcheries and a possibility of earlier prey production. The relatively stable abundance of wild coho salmon may relate to a natural trend toward earlier ocean entry dates. Oscillations in hatchery coho salmon percentage and abundance were related to oscillations in abundance of juvenile pink salmon O. gorbuscha. The impact of oscillating density affected marine survival of hatchery coho salmon more than that of wild coho salmon. Marine survival and abundance of hatchery and wild coho salmon in July were positively related to average fork length, indicating that growth within the first few months after ocean entry affected marine survival. However, absolute size was not important, as wild coho salmon were consistently smaller than hatchery coho salmon. Wild coho salmon responded to conditions in the marine ecosystem differently than hatchery coho salmon, as relationships among growth, survival, and abundance were apparent for wild coho salmon earlier in the year than for hatchery fish. The length increase between July and September was inversely related to marine survival, suggesting that fish that were larger in July grew less and survived better because they were storing more lipids than smaller coho salmon. The study indicated that a more experimental management strategy is needed for both hatchery and wild coho salmon. "
104,1954,Population density estimates and growth rates of Eleutherodactylus coqui in Hawaii,"The Puerto Rican terrestrial frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) has received considerable attention in Hawaii because of its rapid spread, loud mating calls, and its potential threat to native species. Thus far, its invasion potential on the Island of Hawaii remains poorly understood. Critical components for determining this potential are robust estimates of abundance and vital rates across habitat types. To address this lack of information, we used mark-recapture methods to estimate E. coqui survival and abundance, determine growth rates of adult male and female frogs, and relate densities to elevation, snout-vent length (SVL), habitat structure, and invertebrate abundance. Mean adult E. coqui density across eight sites was 62 [plus or minus] 12 adults/100 m2 and ranged from 6-138 adults/100 m2. Our three-year mean adult density estimates were three times greater at three of our study sites (100 adults/100 m2) than the highest long-term estimates from Puerto Rico (33 adults/100 m2). Mean individual growth rates were 0.0078 mm/day ([plus or minus] 0.007 SD, N = 87) for males and 0.0097 mm/day ([plus or minus] 0.009 SD, N = 11) for females. Frogs of similar size were found to be growing slower in Hawaii than Puerto Rico. We found no relationship between elevation and E. coqui density or elevation and SVL or between invertebrate abundance and E. coqui density. However, there was a positive relationship between understory structure and E. coqui density. This relationship suggests that removing understory structure could reduce E. coqui densities, although other potential implications of this management treatment should be considered."
105,2483,"Dolphins in a bottle: abundance, residency patterns and conservation of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus in the semi-closed eutrophic Amvrakikos Gulf, Greece","1. Boat surveys were conducted between 2002 and 2005 to study bottlenose dolphins living in the 400 km2 Amvrakikos Gulf, western Greece. During 116 survey days, 4705 km of total effort resulted in the individual photo-identification of 106 animals, through long-term natural markings on their dorsal fins. 2. Mark-recapture analyses based on the Mth model provided estimates of 82 marked individuals in 2003 (95% CI = 80-91), 92 in 2004 (95% CI = 86-108) and 98 in 2005 (95% CI = 94-110). To include the unmarked portion of the population, the proportion of unmarked individuals was computed based on the number of photographs of marked and unmarked dorsal fins. The mean proportion of unmarked animals in the population was 0.338 (95% CI = 0.288-0.389). By adding this to the estimate for marked animals in 2005, considered as the most robust, a total population estimate of 148 individuals (95% CI = 132-180) was obtained. 3. Dolphin encounter rates in 2003-2005 did not show significant variations, and averaged 7.2 groups per 100 km or 72.5 individuals per 100 km. Encounter rates within the Gulf were about one order of magnitude greater than those found for bottlenose dolphins in nearby eastern Ionian Sea coastal waters. 4. Mean dolphin density in the Gulf was 0.37 animals km-2. This relatively high density, together with high levels of site fidelity shown by most individuals, was thought to be related primarily to prey availability, particularly of epipelagic schooling fish. 5. The importance of the semi-closed Amvrakikos Gulf for bottlenose dolphins and other threatened species encourages the adoption of measures aimed to conserve its valuable ecosystems and raise the naturalistic profile of the area, while promoting environment-conscious development. Meaningful action includes restoring natural hydrology (e.g. freshwater input from rivers), curtailing pollution from various sources, responsible fisheries and aquaculture management, and control of illegal fishing. Interactions between dolphins and fisheries also deserve careful quantitative investigation. "
106,2545,Overfishing and the disappearance of short-beaked common dolphins from western Greece,"Once one of the most common cetaceans in the Mediterranean Sea, the short-beaked common dolphin has declined throughout the region since the 1960s and in 2003 this population was classified as Endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Here, we document the species' precipitous decline in eastern Ionian Sea coastal waters across 13 yr. While 150 animals were present in the study area (1050 km2) in 1996, only 15 were observed in 2007. A 12 mo assessment of fishing effort and catch, together with circumstantial evidence, suggests that the decline was caused largely by prey depletion resulting from overfishing. We analyzed the impacts of various fishing gear and estimated the degree of resource overlap between common dolphins and local fisheries. The total biomass removed annually by 308 fishing boats in the study area averaged 3571 t, while that consumed by common dolphins was 17 t. Resource overlap between common dolphins and fisheries - expressed as an average Pianka index of 0.5 - differed according to fishing gear, being higher for purse seiners (0.7) and beach seiners (0.4) and lower for bottom trawlers (0.1), trammel boats (0.2) and longliners (0.0). Only about 10 active purse seiners (4 % of the total active fishing fleet) were responsible for 33 % of the biomass removal, and likely had the greatest impact on prey of common dolphins. This study indicates a high risk Of local disappearance of common dolphins in the very near future, unless fishery management measures are implemented immediately. Purse seining should be the main management target. "
107,1296,Factors affecting population densities of adult natterjack toads Bufo calamita in Britain.,"1. The population densities of adult natterjack toads (Bufo calamita, Laurenti) were found to vary over an order of magnitude between different localities for this species in Britain. 2. Adult toad population density correlated positively with average toadlet production over the previous decade at each site. 3. Average toadlet production in turn correlated with breeding pond density at natterjack sites and the adult toad population size at one study site increased subsequent to an artificial increase of pond density. 4. Toadlet production within particular ponds was positively correlated with spawn deposition rate and there was no evidence of density-dependent regulation of toadlet production in two natterjack breeding ponds studied over several years. 5. The proportion of breeding seasons in which greater than the median number of toadlets was produced per hectare of total natterjack habitat was positively correlated with pond density at natterjack sites. 6. Taken together, these data suggest that adult natterjack population density is primarily regulated by the average rate of metamorphic success at a site, and this in turn is dependent upon stochastic rather than density-dependent processes operating at the level of the breeding ponds."
108,4139,"Characteristics of Shark Bycatch Observed on Pelagic Longlines off the Southeastern United States, 1992–2000","Data collected by fisheries observers aboard U.S. pelagic longline vessels were examined to quantify and describe elasmobranch bycatch off the southeastern U.S. coast (lat. 22°-35°N, long, 71°-82°W). From 1992 to 2000, 961 individual longline hauls were observed, during which 4,612 elasmobranchs (15% of the total catch) were documented. Of the 22 elasmobranch species observed, silky sharks, Carcharhinus falciformis, were numerically dominant (31.4% of the elasmobranch catch). The catch status of the animals (alive or dead) when the gear was retrieved varied widely depending on the species, with high mortalities seen for the commonly caught silky and night, C. signatus, sharks and low mortalities for rays (Dasyatidae and Mobulidae), blue, Prionace glauca; and tiger, Galeocerdo cuvier; sharks. Discard percentages also varied, ranging from low discards (27.6%) for shorfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, to high discards for blue (99.8%), tiger (98.5%), and rays (100%). Mean fork lengths indicated the majority of the observed bycatch - regardless of species - was immature, and significant quarterly variation in fork length was found for several species including silky; dusky, C. obscurus; night; scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini; oceanic whitetip, C. longimanus; and sandbar, C. plumbeus; sharks. While sex ratios overall were relatively even, blue, tiger, and scalloped hammerhead shark catches were heavily dominated by females. Bootstrap methods were used to generate yearly mean catch rates (catch per unit effort) and 95% confidence limits; catch rates were generally variable for most species, although regression analysis indicated significant trends for night, oceanic whitetip, and sandbar sharks. Analysis of variance indicated significant catch rate differences among quarters for silky, dusky, night, blue, oceanic whitetip, sandbar, and shortfin mako sharks."
109,2617,"No. 490. Declines in finfish resources in Tarawa Lagoon, Kiribati, emphasize the need for increased conservation effort","The very productive lagoon fisheries of Tarawa atoll changed greatly in recent decades as human development and intensive harvesting increased. Tarawa typifies the increasingly common condition of resource depletion and marine community structure change with expanding human activities and population growth. Fisheries-dependent reports have documented the change in fisher landings for nearly two decades. A comparison of fisheries-independent data collected during 1992-93 with data collected in 1977 allowed for documentation of large changes in important finfish resources in Tarawa Lagoon. The historically important bonefish (Albula glossodonta), like other important fishery species, demonstrated declines in catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), proportion of catch, mean length and weight (1977: 46.4 cm, 1.31 kg; 1992-93: 37.6 cm and 0.84 kg), and sex ratio (1977: 0.71:1 [F:M]; 1992-93: 0.15:1). Beach seine sampling of bait fishes demonstrated a major shift in species composition between 1977 and 1992-93, with severe depletion of some preferred species. These results suggest declining abundance in locally important fish species and large changes in species composition within Tarawa Lagoon."
110,45,The ecology and management of the Saiga antelope in Kazakhstan.,"The ecology and management of the Saiga antelope Saiga tatarica tatarica, a nomadic herding species of the desert, semi-desert and steppe ecosystems of Central Asia, are reviewed. The range area and population size of the Saiga in Kazakhstan have changed substantially since they were first described, declining rapidly through the nineteenth century to a low point in the 1920s, followed by recovery until the 1950s and subsequent stabilization. A detailed description is given of the Saiga's habitat and the differences between the winter and summer pastures. The species feeds mainly on grasses, although herbs and shrubs are seasonally important. The migratory patterns of the species divide into directional seasonal migrations and less structured local movements. Group sizes are largest in the calving season and during the autumn migration. Harems are formed in early December. Fertility rates are high, with females giving birth in their first year of life, and routinely twinning thereafter. However, mortality rates are also high in years of drought and harsh winters. The major factors limiting populations include climate, parasites and diseases, predators, and anthropogenic factors. The major human influences are commercial hunting and poaching. Agriculture and habitat alteration are less important currently, although they were probably responsible for the division of the Kazakhstan population into three separate populations. The species was well managed in the Soviet period, with strong institutional structures. However, a new political era requires a re-evaluation of the Saiga's needs, in the face of a growing threat from poaching. "
111,840,"Reproductive variables of American black ducks along the St. Lawrence estuary, 1963-1991.","We examine data from different surveys conducted from 1963 to 1991 in the Baie de l'Isle Verte National Wildlife Area and the surrounding offshore islands, an approximately 20-km2 coastal segment of the St. Lawrence estuary in Quebec. We summarize data regarding various aspects of the nesting ecology of the American black duck (Anas rubripes) (n = 812 nests). Mean laying date, average clutch size, and apparent nesting success did not differ among years (P > 0.05). Black ducks nested earlier on islands (mean Julian date 120.0 vs. 121.3; P = 0.03), but mean clutch size and nesting success on islands did not differ from those on the mainland (P > 0.05). Among mainland-nesting black ducks, those nesting in mixed stands of trees and bushes initiated nests almost 10 days earlier than those nesting in the two other types of nest cover (mean Julian date 124.0 vs. 134.4 and 139.6). Black ducks nesting in such habitats as woodlots, peat bogs, or shrubland laid a larger number of eggs than those nesting in the two other habitat types (mean 9.7 vs. 8.8 and 9.4). Finally, we observed that nesting success of ducks nesting in woodlots, peat bogs, and shrubland and in mixed stands of trees and bushes or of herbaceous plants and shrubs was up to three times higher than at other sites (P ≤ 0.05). We conclude that in addition to protection and restoration of existing islands, more emphasis should be placed on conserving peat bogs, coniferous woodlots, and shrubland, because they also constitute good mainland-nesting habitat for black ducks along the St. Lawrence estuary."
112,4311,Dramatic decline of the bearded reedling Panurus biarmicus in Spanish Mediterranean wetlands,"The apparent stability of the bearded reedling in Spanish inland wetlands contrasts with its threatened status in Spanish coastal wetlands. The species has already disappeared from some coastal areas in Catalonia and its situation is critical in the region of Valencia. In 2013 we studied the breeding populations in three wetlands in Valencia using two methods: census by exhaustive search of individuals (territory mapping) and distance sampling using line transects. We estimated the trend of these populations from data obtained in previous censuses (2005 and 2006), and assessed their viability in the medium and short term using count-based population viability analysis (PVA). Results were alarming in the three studied wetlands, especially in the Albufera de Valencia, where only one breeding pair was found. The percentage of decrease of estimated pairs was similar in all wetlands: ca. 90% between 2005 and 2013. Results from the PVAs predicted a 90% probability of reaching the quasi-extinction threshold before 2024 or 2028 for the largest population of bearded reedling in the Valencia region, El Hondo, while for the Santa Pola population this threshold would be reached before 2016 or 2017. The parallel trend and generalized decline in the Spanish coastal wetlands suggests that these Mediterranean wetlands probably share some specific factors that have adversely affected its populations. Given that all these natural spaces are surrounded by intensively irrigated crops that are subjected to the intense use of pesticides, we hypothesize that these products could have had a detrimental effect on the bearded reedling. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the healthiest populations are situated in Iberian inland wetlands that are surrounded by dry crops, where the use of pesticides is less intense. We propose cataloguing the species as Endangered at regional level."
113,2528,The white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) in the Czech Republic,"The paper summarizes development of the White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) population in the Czech Republic (CR). The White,tailed Eagle ceased breeding in the CR at the end of the 1911, century. The last known breeding occurred in South Bohemia in 1882. After about a hundred years' break, in the mid-80s of the 20,h century, the species started to breed in two core areas in the CR (South Bohemia and South Moravia). The breeding Population in South Bohemia was backed up by a reintroduction project (a total of 9 individuals released 1978-1985). The White-tailed Eagle Subsequently colonized almost the whole Country. In 2000, 25 territories were occupied, in 2005 44 (76% increase) and in 2007 Lip to 55 breeding territories were recorded (120% increase in 7 years). The bulk of the population breeds in lowland areas with a high representation of ponds or wetlands. The highest altitude at which breeding has been confirmed is 700-750 in a.s.l. The most important wintering places are South Moravia and the Trebonsko region in South Bohemia. Birds from Poland (6), Finland (2), Estonia (1) and Germany (1) have been recorded in the CR. The diet of the White-tailed Eagle in the CR consists mainly of fish and waterfowl. Locally, a higher representation of mammals can be recorded (mainly carcasses or grallochs of hoofed game, or Common Vole Microtus arvalis). To protect the eagles, 3 SPAs within the NATURA 2000 project were declared (Trebonsko, Palava, Nove Mlyny middle reservoir). A significant conservation problem of the last years is poisoning by carbofuran. During 2003-2008, 16 individuals were proved or supposed to be poisoned in the CR. In the same period, two cases of shot eagles were reported and two nests were de stroyed by man. A complete bibliography on the White-tailed Eagle in the CR is included."
114,2863,"How has the remnant population of the threatened frog Leiopelma pakeka (Anura: Leiopelmatidae) fared on Maud Island, New Zealand, over the past 25 years?aec_2024 241","Despite widespread global reports of declining amphibian populations, supporting long-term census; data are few, limiting opportunities to study changes in numbers and survival over time. However, in New Zealand,; for the past 25 years (19832008), we studied Leiopelma pakeka, a threatened, terrestrial frog that inhabits rocky; boulder banks under forest on Maud Island. Using night sampling at least annually on two 12 ¥ 12 m plots, we had; 5390 captures of 1000+ individuals, 327 on one plot (grid 1), 751 on the other (grid 2).The mean (SE) number; of frogs found per night was 11.3 (0.6) on grid 1 and 25.6 (1.4) on grid 2.We used capture-recapture models; to estimate population size, proportion of animals remaining beneath the surface and survival rate.

115,1179,Monitoring and conservation of critically reduced marine turtle nesting populations: lessons from the Cayman Islands,"Historically, nesting marine turtles were abundant in the Cayman Islands and were an integral part of the economy and culture. Today, nesting of loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta and green turtles Chelonia mydas takes place at very low levels. Hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata nesting has not been recorded since 1999. We overview highly detailed monitoring data gathered over a 6-year period allowing insight into the magnitude and spatial and temporal patterns of marine turtle nesting, cost-effectiveness of monitoring such reduced populations, impacts of development on reproductive success and current threats to the recovery of the population. Nesting is diffuse and widely distributed for both nesting species on Grand and Little Cayman. Modelled nesting detection profiles for Grand Cayman show that in order to maintain data resolution, most sandy coastline must be surveyed throughout each season. However, in Little Cayman it may be possible to reduce effort. Legal take of adults and illegal take of eggs may be significantly impacting the remaining population. Surprisingly, we observed no significant correlation between density of coastal development and clutch density, adult emergence success or hatching success for either species. A significant relationship exists however, between density of coastal development and incidence of misorientation events in loggerhead hatchlings but not in green turtle hatchlings. Effective protection of known nesting habitat and the elimination of exploitation of remaining adults and eggs within the population are critical to its recovery. "
116,4141,"Establishment of a Self-Sustaining Population of a Long-Lived, Slow-Breeding Gecko Species (Diplodactylidae: Hoplodactylus duvaucelii) Evident 15 Years after Translocation","Duvaucel's Geckos (Hoplodactylus duvaucelii) are large-bodied, long-lived, and slow-breeding geckos endemic to New Zealand. Translocation is considered an important tool for conservation of this species. The first translocation of these geckos occurred in 1998 when 40 geckos were released on a pest-free island. Despite multiple survey efforts within the decade after release, captures were too sparse to determine whether the population had successfully established. We revisited the population to investigate establishment over a longer time period (11-15 yr post release). We utilized a recently developed outcome assessment framework that assesses a translocation's success as a progression through four, time-bound 'Stages.' We recaptured 12 founder animals and all were larger than at release (Stage 1). Recruitment was evident (Stage 2) with 91.7% of all geckos captured between 2009 and 2013 being island-born. Mark-recapture results from 144 individuals estimated that 245 geckos (95% confidence interval: 179-336) were present in the population by February 2013, an approximately 6-fold increase in number since 1998 (Stage 3). Population viability analysis indicated the population has become self-sustaining, with an average population increase rate of 6.35-10.14% per year and a negligible probability of extinction within 50 yr (Stage 4). In this case, a 10-15 yr time period appeared to be a sufficient time frame for identification of translocation success by both traditional and time-bound criteria. Fulfilment of each time-bound indicator of short-term success therefore appears to have been a reliable predictor of ultimate translocation success in this long-lived, slow-breeding lizard species."
117,1363,Estimating Population Size of Elusive Animals with DNA from Hunter-Collected Feces: Four Methods for Brown Bears,"Noninvasive genetic methods can be used to estimate animal abundances and offer several advantages over conventional methods. Few attempts have been made, however, to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the estimates. We compared four methods of estimating population size based on fecal sampling. Two methods used rarefaction indices and two were based on capture-mark-recapture (CMR) estimators, one combining genetic and field data. Volunteer hunters and others collected 1904 fecal samples over 2 consecutive years in a large area containing a well-studied population of brown bears (Ursus arctos). On our 49,000-km 2 study area in south-central Sweden, population size estimates ranged from 378 to 572 bears in 2001 and 273 to 433 bears in 2002, depending on the method of estimation used. The estimates from the best model in the program MARK appeared to be the most accurate, based on the minimum population size estimate from radio-marked bears in a subsection of our sampling area. In addition, MARK models included heterogeneity and temporal variation in detection probabilities, which appeared to be present in our samples. All methods, though, incorrectly suggested a biased sex ratio, probably because of sex differences in detection probabilities and low overall detection probabilities. The population size of elusive animals can be estimated reliably over large areas with noninvasive genetic methods, but we stress the importance of an adequate and well-distributed sampling effort. In cases of biased sampling, calibration with independent estimates may be necessary. We recommend that this noninvasive genetic approach, using the MARK models, be used in the future in areas where sufficient numbers of volunteers can be mobilized."
118,3546,Incidental captures of sea turtles in the driftnet and longline fisheries in northwestern Morocco,"The Moroccan port of Tangier along the Strait of Gibraltar holds a very strategic position biologically, and fisheries and sea turtle populations inevitably interact in this region. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of fishing gear commonly used in Tangier - the driftnet and surface and bottom longlines - on sea turtles in Moroccan waters. Over the 4 years of the study (2003-2004 and 2006-2007), a total of 73 turtles were caught in the driftnets of the 7 vessels studied during 866 fishing days, and 13 turtles in the 4 artisanal longlines vessels evaluated during 593 fishing days. The average estimated catch by the entire fleet using driftnets in the region of Tangier during the years of study is 719 (SD = 543) captures of loggerheads/year and 101 (SD = 57) captures of leatherbacks/year. In the two longline fleets, the average estimated turtle capture in a year was 51 turtles (range = 20-97 turtles; SD = 31) by surface longline and 91 turtles (range = 0-260 turtles; SD = 62) by bottom longline. Drift gillnets appear to have the highest interaction with sea turtles, but new legislation requires that driftnets must be phased out by 2012. However, increasing vigilance will be needed as the port of Tangier plans to expand and increase its capacity and as driftnets are replaced by commercial longlines and other gear types. Given that Moroccan fisheries are impacting sea turtles originating from several nesting populations in the western and eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean, evaluating and mitigating mortality of sea turtles in Morocco and creating a greater awareness for their protection are crucial to the survival and recovery of several nesting populations.

119,4617,"An overview of potamodromous fish upstream movements in medium-sized rivers, by means of fish passes monitoring","This study aims to investigate the upstream movement patterns of potamodromous fish species using multi-annual monitoring of modern multi-species fish passes in two medium-sized Belgian rivers: the Berwinne and the Amblève. During a 6-year monitoring period including a frequency of 1–5 times per week, the captured individuals were identified, measured and weighed to determine species abundance, and the periodicity of their seasonal movement patterns was investigated in relation to environmental factors. In the Amblève, 22 different fish species were monitored (n = 1513 individuals; biomass of 154 kg) and 14 species in the Berwinne (n = 3720; 408 kg). In both fish passes, inter-annual differences were observed, but the first year of monitoring was the best in terms of biomass, indicating the existence of an opening effect just after the fish passes opening, which allowed new migration routes. Salmonids and rheophilic cyprinids were predominant in terms of biomass, while minnow and spirlin were predominant in terms of number of fishes. The diversity in size ranged from 46 to 760 mm demonstrating the importance of movements in various life stages. The capture periodicity showed different mobility patterns between the adult and juvenile stages in most species. Movements occurred frequently during the circum-reproduction period for some species, but many species moved also apart from spawning period. This study highlights the omnipresence of patrimonial holobiotic potamodromous fish at different life stages that reflect their biological needs to move throughout the annual cycle. They must be considered as target species in river continuity restoration programmes and fish-pass design."
120,2322,"The distribution, size and trends of saddlebilled stork Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis","In South Africa, at the periphery of its distribution E. senegalensis has been most abundant in areas where human activity has been limited by factors such as disease or conservation, eg the Kruger National Park (KNP). A statistical power analysis is carried out to determine whether the current survey methods conducted in the KNP, which count storks incidentally, are sufficient to detect trends in population size. The surveys are unable to detect assumed trends. Two other methods have been used to count the KNP saddlebilled stork population, (i) a specific saddlebilled stork aerial survey and (ii) a modified capture-recapture technique based on individual photographic recognition. Both of these have greater power to detect trends in population size than those presently undertaken by the park authorities. -from Authors"
121,2093,"Abundance, distribution, and habitat of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) off California, 1990-2003","Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) are regularly seen off the U.S. West Coast, where they forage on jellyfish (Scyphomedusae) during summer and fall. Aerial line-transect surveys were conducted in neritic waters (92 m depth) off central and northern California during 1990-2003, providing the first foraging population estimates for Pacific leatherback turtles. Males and females of about 1.1 to 2.1 m length were observed. Estimated abundance was linked to the Northern Oscillation Index and ranged from 12 (coefficient of variation (CV)=0.75) in 1995 to 379 (CV=0.23) in 1990, averaging 178 (CV=0.15). Greatest densities were found off central California, where oceanographic retention areas or upwelling shadows created favorable habitat for leatherback turtle prey. Results from independent telemetry studies have linked leatherback turtles off the U.S. West Coast to one of the two largest remaining Pacific breeding populations, at Jamursba Medi, Indonesia. Nearshore waters off California thus represent an important foraging region for the critically endangered Pacific leatherback turtle."
122,3918,"Impact of water salinity on Odontesthes bonariensis (Actinopterygii, Atherinopsidae) fisheries in Chasicó Lake (Argentina)","Odontesthes bonariensis is an inland water ?sh from the Pampas region, valued due to the quality of its ?esh and its attractiveness as a game ?sh. Chasico ´ Lake located in the south of the pampean region is appreciated by ?shermen due to O. bonariensis abundance. However,in thelastyear,areduction in their catches was recorded. In this work, it was analyzed the changes of O. bonariensis biomass in relation toclimate change and salinity in Chasico ´ Lake from 1997 to 2013. From 2004 to 2013, when a dry period began, a reduction in lake area (68.147.4 km2) and an increase in salinity (18.941.5 g l-1) were observed. O. bonariensis catches showed a signi?cant decrease in the same period as a result of salinity; increments. Possibly, at high salinity, O. bonariensis may still develop but with an impaired reproduction and limited embryo and juvenile survival. In conclusion, after 2004, the ?shery quality in Chasico ´ Lake showed a decreasing trend from the maximum registered in the Pampas lakes. This was in agreement with a marked decrease in the lake area which in turn increased water salinity up to levels close to the O. bonariensis tolerance limit."
123,3102,Inventering av faglar i Rautasomradet 1978 och 2001 - populatiions-forandringar i ett fjallomrade,"The breeding bird fauna of the Rautas mountain area, south of Torne trask in northern Sweden, was censused in 1978 and 2001. Sixtyseven 2x2 km squares were censused along 9.6 km transects within each square. Thirtyone of the 63 analysed species showed no significant population changes, 20 species had decreased significantly, and 12 species had increased significantly. Among the increasing species were: Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus, Long-tailed Skua Stercorarius longicaudus, Redpoll Carduelis flammea, and Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus. Among the 20 decreasing species were: Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, Red-throated Pipit Anthus cervinus, Bluethroat Luscinia svecica, and Lapland Bunting Calcarius lapponica. A Correspondence analysis revealed that a relatively large proportion of the species in alpine heathlands had decreased, while there was a mixture of stable, increasing and decreasing species at the woodland and wetland end of the gradient. A possible explanation to the observed population changes could be an increasing number of reindeer in the Swedish mountains since the 1970s, since overgrazing can affect both the availability of nest sites and food negatively."
124,2183,,"The Moroccan population of White-Headed Duck used to be found in the large marshy areas in the North West of the country until the beginning of the 20th Century, the species disappeared in the 1930s or 1940s. A few vagrants were recorded until the end of the 1990s. The increase in the Spanish population has lead to a spectacular increase in the numbers over-wintering in Morocco and the species breeding in 2000. This species is still very vulnerable as all the birds are concentrated on one site the ""Lac de Douyiet""."
125,2139,"Distribution, abundance, and range of the round goby, Apollina melanostoma, in the Duluth-Superior Harbor and St. Louis River estuary, 1998-2004","Round gobies were first discovered in the Duluth-Superior Harbor, Lake Superior, in 1995. Anecdotal sightings by anglers and others suggested that the infestation was growing and expanding; however, direct evidence of the distribution and expansion rate in the harbor was largely unknown. Distribution and range of the round goby, Apollonia melanostoma, (formerly Neogobius melanostomus) was assessed using bottom trawl sampling throughout the Duluth-Superior Harbor, and portions of the lower St. Louis River from 1998 to 2004. Previous to 1998, round gobies only were reported to occupy the harbor between the two shipping entries (river kilometer 1 to 7). By 2004, they expanded throughout the harbor and upstream to river kilometer 13, but remained absent in western Lake Superior. The number of round gobies captured per 5 minutes of trawling (catch per unit effort, CPUE) increased from less than 1 fish in 1998 to an average 5.4 ± 1.2 SE fish in 2004, indicating a large increase in the population. The median yearly fish total length varied from 56.0 to 81.5 mm and wet weight varied from 2.3 to 7.0 g. As nest guarding male round gobies were located in rocky habitats inaccessible to trawling, the initial years were dominated by female round gobies with a 16:1 female to male ratio, but by 2002 the maximum ratio was 2:1. The ratio change may be indicative of the increasing population forcing males from their preferred rocky habitat onto open substrates that were more accessible to trawling."
126,3064,Long-term population dynamics of gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) in a pine plantation in Northern Florida,"A study was conducted in 2009 to gather information on long-term gopher tortoise; (Gopherus polyphemus) population dynamics, burrow distribution, and habitat use at Plum Creek/; Lochloosa, a pine (Pinus elliottii; Pinus palustris) plantation in northern Florida. Markrecapture; surveys were conducted on this study site during the 1980s, and a follow-up survey was done in; 1992. The ca. 66-ha study area is a mosaic of moderately well-drained and poorly drained soils,; and it has had a history of clear-cutting and replanting. Recent management activities included a; tree thinning in 2008 and a controlled burn in winter 2009. We located gopher tortoise burrows; during late April and early May 2009, and captured tortoises in pitfall or wire traps during May; July. Fifty-two tortoises were captured on the study site and 4 others in an adjacent pine; plantation across a paved rural road. Seventeen of the tortoises (33%) had been previously; marked, including a male marked as a mature adult in 1982. Most (88%) marked individuals were; found in the same approximate location (within 200 m) as during earlier surveys, despite the; silviculture-related habitat changes over time. Only 8% of all marked (n = 211) tortoises were; recaptured in 2009. Recapture rates were 4% for tortoises marked when immature, 10% for adult; males, and 21% for adult females. Drill marks held up relatively well in adult tortoises but were; difficult to discern in some tortoises marked as juveniles. Size and sex class distributions of; tortoises captured in 2009 were different from those observed during 19811987 and 1992,; primarily because fewer juveniles were captured in 2009. This follow-up survey indicated that; viable gopher tortoise populations can persist on sites undergoing intensive silviculture, and it; further substantiated tortoise use of windrow berms, ecotones, and relatively well-drained soils."

128,3487,"Recovery without resilience: persistent disturbance and long-term shifts in the structure of fish and coral communities at Tiahura Reef, Moorea.","Disturbances have a critical effect on the structure of natural communities. In this study long-term changes were examined in the reef community at Tiahura Reef, on the northern coast of Moorea, which had been subject to many and varied disturbances over the last 25 years. Tiahura Reef was subject to an outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) in 19801981, causing significant declines in the abundance of scleractinian corals and butterflyfishes. By 2003, the abundance of corals and butterflyfishes had returned to former levels, but despite this apparent recovery, the species composition of coral communities and butterflyfish assemblages was very different from those recorded in 1979. Ongoing disturbances (including further outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish, cyclones, and coral bleaching events) appear to have prevented recovery of many important coral species (notably, Acropora spp.), which has had subsequent effects on the community structure of coral-feeding butterflyfishes. This study shows that recurrent disturbances may have persistent effects on the structure and dynamics of natural communities."
129,1984,Density Dependence in the Terrestrial Stage of Wood Frogs: Evidence from a 21-Year Population Study,"Population regulation in pond-breeding amphibians has generally been assumed to occur through density dependence in the aquatic larval stage. However, studies examining terrestrial stage population dynamics are comparatively rare. As a consequence, the relative importance of density dependence in the terrestrial stage remains largely unknown. Here I determine the density dependence of terrestrial stage vital rates, including juvenile and adult survival, age and size at first reproduction, and reproductive traits, for a population of Wood Frogs, Rana sylvatica, in Michigan. I also examine the carry-over effects of density-dependent variation in metamorphic traits on adult demographic traits. During the 21 years of this study, the number of breeding adult males and females varied by an order of magnitude, whereas the number of metamorphic juveniles leaving the pond varied by two orders of magnitude. Adult male and female annual survival was negatively correlated with the number of males and females, respectively. Partial correlation coefficients (holding population size of the opposite sex, number of juveniles, and precipitation levels constant) indicated that variation in adult male and female survival was largely explained by variation in the number of males and females, respectively. Juvenile survival (both males and females) was strongly negatively correlated with juvenile population size but not juvenile body size, adult population size, or total precipitation. Partial correlations revealed that variation in juvenile population size was the single most important factor accounting for variation in male and female juvenile survival, and female age and size at first reproduction. Clutch size and egg size also varied with juvenile population size independent of female body size. At lower juvenile population sizes, female juveniles matured earlier, at a larger body size, and produced larger numbers of smaller eggs than at high juvenile population sizes. Although juvenile body size was positively correlated with male and female reproductive body size and total clutch weight, juvenile fitness traits, in general, were more closely related to variation in juvenile population sizes. Larval traits did not affect adult fitness traits in the terrestrial stage. A nonlinear logistic model best described the functional relationship between juvenile population size and the number of surviving males, females, and total adult biomass. As number of juveniles produced increased, the number of surviving adult males, females, and total biomass plateaued, suggesting that the terrestrial environment limited adult population size. My results demonstrate that density-dependent effects operating in the terrestrial stage may be important in regulating Wood Frog population size. "
130,3799,"Population ecology, life history and diet of the shorthead drum Larimus breviceps in a tropical bight in southeastern Brazil","The population biology, life history parameters and diet of the shorthead drum Larimus breviceps were assessed in Caraguatatuba Bight, a shallow non-estuarine environment. Two homogeneous areas, South and North, were selected, avoiding major sources of continental waters. Monthly from October 2003 to October 2004, three random samples were taken by trawling from 800 to 1600m outward from the waterline. Larimus breviceps was the third most abundant species during the study period, and was considerably more abundant from February to May 2004. Smaller individuals were also more abundant during this period, which we therefore considered the main recruitment period of the species. The predominance of individuals of a limited size range (6-12cm total length) seems to indicate that the area functions as a nursery for L. breviceps, sheltering late-juvenile individuals. This feature complicated the estimation of life history parameters, but by taking into account the peculiarities of the area and the identification of similar modal progressions during the sampling period, we obtained reasonable values for the parameterization of the von Bertalanffy Growth Model (L [infinity]=32.25cm, K = 0.72, t max 4.38y, Z=12.104). The total mortality index does not reflect mortality rates only, but also the migration of older individuals to other, probably deeper, areas. The diet was based mainly on Crustacea, specifically Decapoda shrimps, with slight seasonal alterations."
131,898,Assessing the Risks of Extinction for Local-Populations of Roan Antelope Hippotragus-Equinus,"We estimated the minimum size of the roan antelope Hippotragus equinus population in the Parc National de l'Akagera in Rwanda to be at least 144 animals, based on a two and a half year study of individually recognized stable social groups. Data from the same study were used to estimate the annual birth rate, and the survival rate of male calves, female calves, adult females and juvenile females; and to identify factors which would result in year-to-year variations in survival. The results of this analysis were incorporated into an age-structured model of the population's dynamics which took account of demographic and environmental stochasticity. This model was then used to determine the viability of the roan population in the park and to identify demographic characteristics whose occurrence could be used to predict when the population was most at risk of extinction. The risk of extinction could be predicted if the number of stable groups within the park was monitored in September of each year. This risk could be greatly reduced if a reciprocal arrangement was established with other protected areas such that the population in the park could be reinforced with new stable groups when the number of stable groups fell below three. However, the risks-particularly of disease transfer-associated with such reinforcement programmes should be clearly recognized. "

135,1247,"The distribution, abundance and population trends of gentoo, rockhopper and king penguins in the Falkland Islands.","The Falkland Islands are a globally important breeding location for seabirds, including penguins. The total breeding populations of three of the four main penguin species present in the Falklands were censused in the austral summer of 1995/96. The results for gentoo and rockhopper penguins suggest declines of about 43 and 90 per cent, respectively, since a similar census in 1932/33. Recent monitoring studies suggest that these declines are still continuing; research to investigate causes (which is likely to reflect changes in the marine, rather than terrestrial environment) is a high priority. In contrast, king penguin populations, currently c. 400 pairs, have increased steadily, by 700 per cent since 1980/81, in line with world-wide trends for this species."
136,1747,"Evaluating trends in abundance of immature Green Turtles, Chelonia mydas, in the greater caribbean","Many long-lived marine species exhibit life history traits that make them more vulnerable to overexploitation. Accurate population trend analysis is essential for development and assessment of management plans for these species. However, because many of these species disperse over large geographic areas, have life stages inaccessible to human surveyors, and/or undergo complex developmental migrations, data on trends in abundance are often available for only one stage of the population, usually breeding adults. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is one of these long-lived species for which population trends are based almost exclusively on either numbers of females that emerge to nest or numbers of nests deposited each year on geographically restricted beaches. In this study, we generated estimates of annual abundance for juvenile green turtles at two foraging grounds in the Bahamas based on long-term capture-mark-recapture (CMR) studies at Union Creek (24 years) and Conception Creek (13 years), using a two-stage approach. First, we estimated recapture probabilities from CMR data using the Cormack-Jolly-Seber models in the software program MARK; second, we estimated annual abundance of green turtles at both study sites using the recapture probabilities in a Horvitz-Thompson type estimation procedure. Green turtle abundance did not change significantly in Conception Creek, but, in Union Creek, green turtle abundance had successive phases of significant increase, significant decrease, and stability. These changes in abundance resulted from changes in immigration, not survival or emigration. The trends in abundance on the foraging grounds did not conform to the significantly increasing trend for the major nesting population at Tortuguero, Costa Rica. This disparity highlights the challenges of assessing population-wide trends of green turtles and other long-lived species. The best approach for monitoring population trends may be a combination of (1) extensive surveys to provide data for large-scale trends in relative population abundance, and (2) intensive surveys, using CMR techniques, to estimate absolute abundance and evaluate the demographic processes driving the trends."
137,2802,Changes in the fish fauna of a tropical Australian estuary since 1990 with reference to prawn predators and environmental change,"As part of a study of the reasons for declining commercial banana prawn catches in the Weipa area of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and in order to assess whether changes in predator numbers may be a factor influencing prawn numbers, the species composition, numbers and biomasses of fishes in the Embley estuary were re-examined in February 2005 for comparison with the results of a study between 1986 and 1990. The new study duplicated previous methods and used the same sampling sites and the same gear employed during February sampling periods from 1986 to 1990. Overall, the species diversity and catch rates, as well as the numbers of penaeid prawn predators had changed little over 20 years. The overall catch rate for 2005 was 37.4 g m-1 h-1, not significantly different from the overall catch rate of 32.8 g m-1 h-1 (SE 6.6) for the period from 1987 to 1989. The results are discussed in relation to environmental factors and climate change, as well as the substantial declines in prawn catches, which had fallen from over 800 tonnes per annum prior to 1998, to about 70 tonnes per annum."
138,1949,Annual variation in population estimators for a southern population of Ambystoma maculatum,"For six breeding seasons (1997-2002), we conducted an intensive mark-recapture study oil a breeding population of the spotted salamander, Ambystoma macidatum, near the southern edge of their range in east-central Alabama. A drift fence completely encircling an ephemeral pond was used to capture all adult salamanders migrating into or out of the pond, and passive integrated transponders were used to provide individual identification. The Jolly-Seber method of population estimation was used to estimate three population parameters (size, gains, and survivorship); population growth rate was also estimated. Gains varied annually, ranging from 24 [plus or minus] 16 to 101 [plus or minus] 24, and population growth rate was low (r = 0.18 [plus or minus] 0.188), suggesting inconsistent recruitment. Consistent with life history parameters of long-lived, late-maturing species, survivorship (range 0.629 [plus or minus] 0.064 to 0.699 [plus or minus] 0.08) and breeding population sizes (range 189 [plus or minus] 24 to 260 [plus or minus] 16) remained essentially constant. The demographics for A. maculatum provided by this study are useful for planning conservation initiatives."
139,4113,Patterns of Community Structure and Microhabitat Usage in Peruvian Pristimantis (Anura: Strabomantidae),"[We examined patterns of community structure and microhabitat requirements of Pristimantis frogs at sites of high geographic proximity in the Tambopata region of southeastern Peru. Herpetofaunal surveys were conducted at five sites encompassing approximately 131 square km of Tambopata Province, including EcoAmazon&#xed;a (EA), Reserva Amaz&#xf3;nica (RA), Explorer's Inn (EI), Sachavacayoc Centre (SC), and Tambopata Research Center (TRC). In addition to sampling and identifying all species of Pristimantis captured, environmental variables, including substrate, perch height, leaf litter depth, tree cover, and time of day, were collected and analyzed. Total frog encounters, species richness, diversity, and community similarity differed significantly among sites. Generally, similarity, richness, and diversity were not closely related to geographic proximity, but total abundance was. More individuals were captured at SC and TRC, whereas more total species were captured at TRC and EI. Diversity was the highest at TRC, followed by RA, EI, EA, and SC. Encounters of P. toftae and P. peruvianus also differed significantly among sites, with one species rarely encountered where the other was prevalent. Generally, more individuals of Pristimantis were captured during the wet season at all five sites. Significantly more individuals were captured during the night than the day. Significantly more individuals as well as species were captured on leaves and the ground versus all other substrate types, with more on leaves at night and on the ground during the day. Significantly more adults were captured higher off the ground than juveniles, with males found higher than females. There was no significant relationship between frog encounters and leaf litter or tree cover. Pristimantis peruvianus was shown to exhibit differences in microhabitat usage from P. toftae. We conclude that many factors contribute to the observed differences in diversity among the sites, requiring future studies that will also examine other environmental variables such as forest type, soil characteristics, and prey availability."
140,3955,Enigmatic declines in bird numbers in lowland forest of eastern Ecuador may be a consequence of climate change,"Birdpopulationshavedeclinedinmanypartsoftheworldbutmostofthosedeclines canbeattributedtoeffectsofhumanactivities(e.g.,habitatfragmentation);declines in areas unaffected by human activities are not common. We have been sampling birdpopulationsatanundisturbedsiteinlowlandforestofeasternEcuadorannually since 2001 using a combination of mist nets and direct observations on two 100-ha plots. Bird numbers fluctuated on both plots during the first 8 years but did not show a consistent pattern of change. Since about 2008, numbers of birds on both plots have declined; capture rates in 2014 were?40% less than at the start of the study and observation rates were?50% less. Both understory and canopy species declined in abundance. Overall, insectivores showed the most pronounced declines but declines varied among trophic groups. The period from 2008 onward also was a period of stronger La Nina events which, at this study site, are associated with increased rainfall. The mechanism for the declines is not known but likely reflects a combination of reduced reproductive success coupled with reduced survival associatedwithchangingclimate."
141,3942,Long-term variation in abundance of terrestrial mammals and birds in eastern Ecuador as measured by photographic rates and occupancy estimates,"Long-term studies from undisturbed forests provide a baseline by which to assess impacts of human activities, including climate change, on vertebrate population dynamics in lowland tropical forests. We use camera-trap data from January to March, 2005 to 2015, to examine patterns of variation in numbers of images and occupancy (proportion of cameras where images of a species were obtained), variables that may reflect changes in abundance or activity patterns of terrestrial mammals and birds in an undisturbed lowland forest of eastern Ecuador. We accumulated 1,961 independent records of 31 mammal species and 427 images of 17 bird species during 5,547 trap-days. Number of mammal species ranged from 15 to 25 per year (107 to 466 images), whereas birds ranged from 3 to 11 species per year (10 to 122 images). Capture rates varied both among species and among years but showed no evidence of declines; populations of several species appeared to increase (Priodontes maximus, Dasypus novemcinctus, Pecari tajacu, and Dasyprocta fuliginosa). Similarly, occupancy rates provided no indication of consistent declines; occupancy rates increased significantly for D. fuliginosa, D. novemcinctus, and P. maximus. There was no indication that variation in either capture rates or occupancy was related to variation in large-scale climate trends as represented by the Southern Oscillation Index. Results suggest that populations of most species that are well sampled by camera traps have remained relatively stable over 11 years. Long-term studies from other regions in the tropics are needed to evaluate the generality of this pattern."
142,4429,A century of change in Glaucous-winged Gull (Larus glaucescens) populations in a dynamic coastal environment,"As conspicuous midtrophic omnivores, gulls can serve as useful indicators to characterize long-term ecological changes in marine ecosystems. Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) have been studied in the Georgia Basin of British Columbia, Canada, an urbanized coastal zone, since the late 1800s. We collated all available information to develop a (noncontinuous) 111-year time series of counts at breeding colonies, and combined these counts with demographic vital rates to assess how changes in historical gull egg harvesting practices, forage fish abundance, and Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) numbers affected gull population trajectories from 1900 to 2010. Mean counts at 87 breeding colonies in the Georgia Basin showed a nonlinear trend, increasing from historical low counts in the early part of the twentieth century to peak values in the 1980s, and declining thereafter to the end of the time series. Demographic models that integrated temporal trends in clutch size and nesting success, and which also included a food-related decline in first-year survival or a further reduction in nesting success as a function of eagle abundance, successfully reproduced trajectories of gull population growth rates over the study period. Glaucous-winged Gulls have thus responded to a series of changes in the Georgia Basin. These patterns are consistent with population release following cessation of egg harvesting; growing reliance by gulls on nonfish foods and resulting declines in clutch size, productivity, and first-year survival; and the effects of recovering Bald Eagle populations. These results highlight the value of compiling data from multiple retrospective studies to better understand the complex factors affecting long-term trends in animal populations."
143,2744,Moose recovery plan for Poland: main objectives and tasks,"Hunting statistics showed that moose (Alces alces) numbers in Poland declined from 5,400 animals in 1991 to 1,718 in 2000. A nation-wide ban on moose hunting was imposed in 2001 in response to this decline in moose abundance. The main purpose of this paper is to outline a moose recovery plan in Poland by using verification of hunting records related to moose population numbers, collecting data on population demographic variables, and understanding moose habitat preferences. During 1998-2002 in the forest habitat of north-eastern Poland (total area: 311,400 ha) a line intercept snow track index and plot sampling were used to estimate moose population numbers at 276 animals. It was shown that the population census in this area carried out by hunters in this period through a guess-estimate method overestimated the moose population by 46.0%. Research in Augustowska Forest (110,200 ha) shows that the autumn recruitment rate was 64.4 calves per 100 cows, and the ratio of cows to bulls was 1.34. Analysis of moose population dynamics during 4 hunting seasons (1998-2001) shows that the maximum sustainable harvest is about 30% of population numbers estimated in February. Habitat selection by moose was tested using Bailey's 95% simultaneous confidence intervals. Moose preferred habitats in bog and wet sites dominated by deciduous and mixed forests. The decline in moose populations in Poland over 20 years was caused by overestimation of population numbers and over-harvest. It is suggested that a moose recovery program in Poland should be started by locating 2 large moose management/conservation units where moose population numbers should be estimated by reliable methods, and sustained harvest would then maintain a viable moose population. At the same time, forestry in moose wintering areas should stimulate deciduous browse production as well as providing estimates of forest damage caused by moose using different standards than those applied in lowland commercial forests."
144,3078,"Distribution, phenology and long term trends of Red Knots Calidris canutus in France","The two subspecies of the Red Knot Calidris canutus that occur in Europe during northward and southward; migration, islandica and canutus, are only observed simultaneously at a few sites such as the Wadden Sea. Mostly; islandica winters on estuarine bays in NW Europe, while canutus go to wintering grounds in W or S Africa.; The coasts of France have been described as the main southern limit of the winter distribution of islandica; and as providing stopover sites for canutus migrating between the W African coast and breeding grounds; in Siberia. Nevertheless, the role and the importance of French sites remain unclear for both subspecies,; especially during southward migration.; This study updates information on the numbers and the distribution of Red Knots staging or wintering along; the coasts of France using International Waterbird Census (IWC) data (counts carried out in Jan, 19762010,; organised by Wetlands International) and synchronized monthly counts carried out in Frances National; Nature Reserves during 20002010. In recent years, France has supported around 9% (c.35,000 individuals); of the estimated population of islandica in mid-winter. Ninety percent of these birds are concentrated; in just six bays, two along the Channel coast and four along coasts of Vendée and Charente-maritime. As; intertidal areas are limited along the Mediterranean shore, it does not support Red Knots in winter. Numbers; of islandica peak in mid-winter, but significant passage of canutus occurs in May on the central Atlantic; coast. Patterns of autumn migration remain unclear and information on occurrence of both subspecies is; lacking. Long term trends in site use differ from place to place; this is probably an indication that they are; used by birds of different origin and age."
145,1500,Population Trends of the Galapagos Penguin: Impacts of El Nino and La Nina,"The Galapagos Penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) population probably has always been small and largely restricted to the islands of Fernandina and Isabela. Counts suggest the current population of Galapagos Penguins is likely between 4,250 and 8,500, half of what it was in the early 1970s. Population size has varied and declined probably because of substantial changes in oceanic conditions. Body condition as evidenced by weight is enhanced during cold surface water conditions, La Nina, and deteriorates when surface waters are warmed, El Nino, and under the most severe conditions, penguins starve. Analysis of a long-term data set from counts of the population suggests that the population has fluctuated, dropping precipitously after the 1982-1983 El Nino and has since then been recovering very slowly. This parallels the overall warming in the Pacific during the last 20 years associated with the more frequent El Nino and less frequent La Nina events. These trends suggest that long-term global climate warming is likely to threaten the Galapagos Penguin population particularly because the population is small and its distribution restricted. New threats from climatic warming and increasing human perturbations such as fishing, inadvertent discharge of petroleum products, and transport of potential predators and pathogens to islands increase the risk of extinction."
146,2631,Penguins as Marine Sentinels,"From the tropics to Antarctica, penguins depend on predictable regions of high ocean productivity where their prey aggregate. Increases in precipitation and reductions in sea ice associated with climate warming are affecting penguins. The largest breeding colony of Patagonian (Magellanic) penguins, at Punta Tombo, Argentina, had approximately 200,000 breeding pairs in October 2006 - a decline of 22% since 1987. In the 1980s and 1990s, petroleum pollution was a major source of Patagonian penguin mortality. In 1994, tanker lanes were moved 40 kilometers (km) farther off the coast of Chubut, and the dumping of ballast water and the oiling of penguins are now rare. However, penguins are swimming 60 km farther north from their nests during incubation than they did a decade ago, very likely reflecting shifts in prey in response to climate change and reductions in prey abundance caused by commercial fishing. These temperate penguin species, marine sentinels for southern oceans, demonstrate that new challenges are confronting their populations. "
147,2519,The white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) in Slovakia,"This review presents data on the size of the winter and breeding population of the White-tailed Eagle in the Slovak Republic in the period 2001 to 2007. Exact data on the number of wintering eagles have been collected from the Slovak-Hungarian part of the Danube River since 2002. Along this 182 km long Danube River section and its adjacent region including the water bodies of the Gabeikovo power plant, the highest number of eagles recorded was 70. The breeding population lives along the Slovak part of the Danube River, where the highest number of successful breeding pairs per year Was four (in 2004), and in Eastern Slovakia with a maximum of two successfully breeding pairs recorded in 2006."
148,884,Squirrel monkeys in Costa Rica: drifting to extinction.,"Central American squirrel monkeys Saimiri oerstedii are limited to Costa Rica and Panama, and have never been abundant. The Costa Rican population is now decimated. Based on our survey of squirrel monkeys throughout a large portion of the Costa Rican range of this species in 1996, we can confirm that at least 1246 squirrel monkeys remain in 26 spatially dispersed localities. Despite probable undercounts of squirrel monkeys within sites and potentially missed localities, the total population size should be considered far below a size that would provide long-term genetic viability. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation spurred by agricultural and tourism development are the familiar culprits contributing to this decline. Our strong recommendation is that future conservation efforts be targeted at the level of each specific locality, perhaps recruiting local, national and international sponsors. A focused strategy would allow management efforts to be tailored to the circumstances specific to each site and thus allocate scarce resources more efficiently."
149,2400,Occurrence of killer whales in Scottish inshore waters: temporal and spatial patterns relative to the distribution of declining harbour seal populations,"1. Sightings of killer whales around Shetland were recorded between 1991 and 2006 and for the whole of Scotland for 2007. The data were used to investigate temporal patterns in killer Whale Occurrence around Shetland and spatial patterns in Occurrence around Scotland. 2. There was a strong seasonal peak in sightings around Shetland during June-July, coinciding with the harbour seal pupping Season. 3. There was no clear trend in annual sightings around Shetland between 1991 and 2006. 4. Killer whales were sighted most frequently around Shetland and the Pentland Firth as well as around Mull and the Treshnish Isles. 5. These findings are discussed in terms of potential impacts upon local declining harbour seal populations and future research requirements. "
150,1349,Density dependence in the camelid Vicugna vicugna: the recovery of a protected population in Chile,"The vicuña Vicugna vicugna is a wild South American camelid. Following over-exploitation, which brought the species to the brink of extinction in Chile in the 1960s, the population was protected. Since 1975 the population has been censused annually, generating one of the most extensive long-term census databases for any South American mammal. In this paper we use these data, and measures of environmental parameters, to describe the population growth trend of the species and to estimate carrying capacity. Our results indicate that the vicuña has been protected successfully in northern Chile. The census data reveal that, following protection, the population displayed logistic growth between 1975 and 1992. Population growth rate declined linearly with population size, which indicates a degree of density dependence. Density independent factors, such as rainfall, may also have been important. The principal density dependent effect observed was that birth rate declined in those family groups with the most breeding females. The carrying capacity of the study area was estimated from the census data and from models based on precipitation and local primary productivity. Using the census data, an estimation of carrying capacity as the asymptote of the fitted logistic curve suggested that the vicuña population should reach approximately 26,000 vicuñas, whereas estimation when the population growth rate was equated to zero gave a carrying capacity of c. 22,000. Coe's method based on local precipitation predicted 31,000 vicuña, whereas Lavenroth's method based on local primary productivity predicted 26,000 vicuña. In reality, the census data showed that the population peaked at 22,463 vicuñas in 1990. The results are discussed in relation to the need for better census techniques and the implications of density dependent effects for the management of the vicuña in Chile. "
151,4143,Elasmobranch bycatch in the Italian Adriatic pelagic trawl fishery,"Elasmobranchs are among the most threatened long-lived marine species worldwide, and incidental capture is a major source of mortality. The northern central Adriatic Sea, though one of the most overfished basins of the Mediterranean Sea, supports a very valuable marine biodiversity, including elasmobranchs. This study assesses the impact of the northern central Adriatic pelagic trawl fishery on common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), common eagle ray (Myliobatis aquila), and pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) by examining incidental catches recorded between 2006 and 2015. The distribution of bycatch events was evaluated using geo-referenced data. Generalized Linear Models were computed to standardize the catch of the four species and to predict the relative abundance of bycatch events. Data analysis shows that most bycatch events involving all four species occurred in the northern Adriatic Sea. The models predicted significant, distinct temporal patterns of standardized catches in line with previous investigations. Water depth, season, and fishing region were the best predictors to explain bycatch events. The present data suggest that the northern Adriatic may be an important nursery area for several elasmobranchs. They also highlight the urgent need for a better understanding of the interactions between elasmobranchs and fisheries to develop and apply suitable, ad hoc management measures."
152,1962,A long term study of small mammal populations in a Brazilian agricultural landscape,"Long-term monitoring of small mammal populations is very important to understand the variations in temporal abundance on a large time scale, which are related to ecological, economic and epidemiological phenomena. The aim of this study is to monitor the populations of the marsupials Didelphis aurita and Philander frenatus and the rodents Nectomys squamipes, Akodon cursor and Oligorysomys nigripes in a locality of typical Brazilian rural landscape, Sumidouro Municipality, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. A mark-recapture study was conducted during five years. We analyzed the population dynamics, the reproduction and age structure of these species. Both marsupials presented higher population sizes in the end of wet period and beginning of the dry period, which can be explained by the seasonal reproduction which begins in the middle of the dry period and ends in the last months of the wet period. N. squamipes reproduced throughout the year but mostly during rainy periods, due to the close association of this rodent to resources found in the water. Higher survivorship and recruitment rates were in the end of the wet season. The rodent A. cursor had an opportunist reproduction, resulting in high turnover rates. Survivorship increased with the effects of the dry periods. O. nigripes showed a clear annual pattern of population cycle with peaks during the dry season. The rodents did not show potential to present outbreaks and become agricultural pests. The annual population cycles of O. nigripes and the unique peak of A. cursor population during five years highlight attention to their importance as wild reservoirs of the hantavirus disease. Their ecological characteristics associated to their opportunistic behavior make these species prone to be good reservoirs of zoonoses. "
153,2769,Sex- and age-dependent effects of population density on life history traits of red deer Cervus elaphus in a temperate forest,"We studied both the short- and long-term effects of density on three life history traits of a red deer population inhabiting a temperate forest. Both male and female body mass increased when population density decreased, but male mass changed to a greater extent than female mass. Density did not influence female survival irrespective of age, however, survival of males was lower at high density for all age classes except the prime-age class. Pregnancy rates of primiparous females increased markedly with decreasing density, whereas those of adult hinds were fairly constant and unrelated to density. For both sexes, of the studied life history traits we detected a long-term effect of density at birth (cohort effect) only on body mass. These results suggest that density influences life history traits in the same way as factors of environmental variation such as climate. In this population we did not find any evidence for an influence of climatic conditions on life history traits of red deer. Both mild winters and the absence of summer droughts during the study period could account for such an absence of climatic effects. We interpreted our results to show that 1) as expected for a highly dimorphic and polygynous species such as red deer, male traits showed consistently higher sensitivity to variation in density than female traits, illustrating possible costs caused by sexual selection in males, 2) the female-based Eberhardt's model according to which increasing density should sequentially affect juvenile survival, reproductive rates of primiparous females, reproductive rates of adults and lastly adult survival was only partly supported because we found that pregnancy rate of primiparous females rather than juvenile survival was the most sensitive trait to variation in density. We propose that including variation in male traits would improve the accuracy of models of population dynamics of large mammals, at least for highly dimorphic species. Because the population we studied was not fenced, we only measured apparent survival. We discuss how dispersal, in relation to the phenotypic quality of young deer, might be a potential regulating factor under such conditions."

155,2089,Population limitation of the northern red-backed vole in the boreal forests of northern Canada,"1. Across the vast boreal forests of North America, no population cycles in Clethrionomys species occur. In Eurasia, by contrast, some Clethrionomys populations of the same species undergo regular 3-5-year cycles. We examined the effects of nutrients, food, competitors, predators and climate on population limitation in the northern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rutilus Pallas) in the south-western Yukon to determine why this difference occurs.2. From 1986 to 1996 we added food, reduced large mammal predators and excluded snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) from large plots and found that none of these manipulations affected red-backed vole abundance. Adding nutrients as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) fertilizer had a slight negative effect, probably acting through a reduction in dwarf shrub productivity caused by competition from grasses.3. We monitored weasel populations directly through trapping and indirectly through snow tracking. Predation by these vole specialists was irrelevant as a limiting factor most of the time because voles in this area do not reach the densities needed to sustain weasel populations. Other boreal forest mammal and bird predators did not focus on red-backed voles. However, when red-backed vole populations increased in the forest and Microtus voles also increased in the meadows, weasel populations increased and may have temporarily depressed red-backed voles in winter.4. We monitored one major potential food, white spruce seeds, but seed fall was not related to population changes in red-backed voles, even after mast years.5. We assessed the impact of weather variables, and the average depth of the snow pack during winter (October-March) was correlated directly with vole demography, having both direct effects in that year and delayed effects in the following year.6. Our long-term trapping data (1973-96) indicate that Clethrionomys populations fluctuated, with peaks following hare peaks by 2-3 years.7. We propose that the key variable limiting these vole populations is overwinter survival, and this is a function of overwinter food from berries produced during the previous summer by dwarf shrubs. These shrubs may be stimulated by abundant moisture from winter snows or by periodic fertilization from large quantities of pellets produced at snowshoe hare peaks."
156,852,Population cycles in small mammals: the problem of explaining the low phase,"Cycles characterize the demography of many populations of microtine rodents and snowshoe hares. A phase of low numbers often follows the decline and introduces a lag that lengthens the cycle. This low can last 1-3 yr in microtines and 2-4 yr in hares. Understanding the low phase is critical in explaining population cycles. Two major classes of hypotheses try to account for the low phase. The first proposes that something may be 'wrong' with the extrinsic environment. The most promising of these extrinsic explanations is that predation, acting either directly or indirectly, has delayed density-dependent effects on prey populations during the low phase. The second class of hypotheses proposes that something may be 'wrong' with the animals themselves. The most likely intrinsic factors are maternal effects or age effects on fitness during the low phase. Experimental tests for each of these sets of hypotheses are needed, and we suggest replicated experiments on focal species in two continents to resolve these unknowns."
157,3840,"Elephant poaching in Niassa Reserve, Mozambique: population impact revealed by combined survey trends for live elephants and carcasses","Trends in the populations of large herbivores in Niassa Reserve, Mozambique, have been monitored through biennial aerial surveys since 1998. The elephant Loxodonta africana population has been subjected to intensive illegal hunting since 2006. We used a simple population model to mimic the observed trends in the numbers of live and dead elephants to demonstrate the impact of poaching. The number of fresh or recent carcasses recorded was used in the model as an index of the annual mortality rate. A maximum likelihood analysis to compare population models revealed that the best fit to the survey estimates of both live elephants and old or very old carcasses was a model that started with 6,635 elephants in 1987. This number increased through births by 4.6% annually and decreased through deaths from natural and anthropogenic causes. In the best-fit model, the mean mortality rate in any year was 3.2 times the observed 1 + 2 carcass ratio (ratio for carcasses in age categories 1 and 2), and carcasses remained visible for a mean of 6 years. The model suggested that c. 900 elephants were poached during 20072010 and another c. 1,000 during 2011. Population estimates for live elephants and carcasses are now routine outcomes of aerial surveys conducted as part of the CITES programme for Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants, and our method can be applied to any population with a time series of estimates for live and dead elephants."
158,2427,Dynamics of the colonization process in reintroduced populations of the Alpine marmot,"The project of marmot reintroduction in the Dolomiti Bellunesi National Park started in 2006. In May 2006 and May 2007, 80 ear-marked (by sex and family) marmots were released in two separate areas (20 ind./year/area). In summer 2008 the populations produced 36 and 39 individuals, respectively; the animals born in the areas exceeded the number of released animals that survived. Only one pair bred successfully in the year of release; 87.5% of the surviving pairs bred the following year, including the pair breeding the previous year. We recorded the reproduction of a single female, and the acceptance of the litter by the male who later joined her. Mortality of the animals released in 2006 was 39% before the first winter and increased to 53.6% after the second summer. The first summer mortality of animals released in 2007 was higher, probably because of greater predation by golden eagles. The population density increased in late summer 2008 to 13.5 and 22.2 family units/100 ha, respectively in the two areas. In 2006, when both areas were uninhabited, the mean dispersion distance from the release site to settlement sites was greater in males than in females. Sixty-one per cent of the settlements consisted of pairs; 33%, a single male; and 6%, of a trio (marmots from different families). The single males settled more distantly than paired males. Of all the possible ""same-family composed"" pairs, 77.6% occurred."
159,3302,Fish assemblages in a north Atlantic coastal ecosystem: Spatial patterns and environmental correlates,"Analyses of six years of bottom trawl data collected from Northumberland Strait, southern Gulf of St. Lawrence revealed four major fish assemblages, two of which occurred in the same two geographic areas each year. One of the two persistent assemblages occurred in deeper water off northwestern Prince Edward Island and consisted mostly of demersal fishes. The other persistent assemblage contained a mixture of demersal and pelagic fishes and occurred primarily in shallow water of central Northumberland Strait. Analyses of abiotic (depth, bottom temperature, substratum type) and biotic (presence of American lobster Homarus americanus, northern lady crab Ovalipes ocellatus) factors revealed bottom temperature and catches of lady crab correlate best with the fish assemblage structure each year, but correlation values were low (ρw ≤ 0.48). Combinations of all abiotic and biotic variables only marginally improved the strength of the correlations in four of six years (2002, 2003, 2005, 2006). Changes observed in the Northumberland Strait ecosystem over the six years included an increase in the ratio of pelagic to demersal fishes, disappearance of one of the four assemblages, and increased spatial overlap between the two persistent assemblages, which coincided with an increase in bottom temperature. The increasing importance of pelagic fishes, relative to demersal fishes, suggests a shift in food web structure may be occurring in Northumberland Strait. "
160,4461,Historic decline and recent increase of Burbot (Lota lota) in the Netherlands,"In the Netherlands, Burbot Lota lota have severely declined due to aquatic system modifications and agricultural intensification. The aim of this study was to evaluate the species distribution and population trends and to interpret its decline for conservation and management-planning. Historic and present distributions were examined by GIS analysis, while the decline was quantified using binary logistic regression of presence-absence data. Records suggest that at the beginning of the twentieth century the overall Burbot population was relatively stable but reached a turning point from a positive to a negative population phase around 1950. Today, only two areas with spawning populations remain. Recently, increasing numbers of Burbot have been recorded in one of these areas, viz. the lakes in the confluence area of the rivers Vechte; and IJssel. This increase could be attributed to annual stockings in German reaches of the River Vechte since 2001, with stock material originating from the rivers Elbe and Weser. Because of the low numbers in which Burbot populations were present and the risks of introduction of non-local stock, Burbot requires imperative tools and action plans for recovery and conservation in the Netherlands."
161,4475,"Stock identification of Rajaclavata L. (Chondrichthyes, Rajidae) in two contiguous areas of the Mediterranean","The abundance, occurrence, biological features, growth and mortality parameters of the thornback ray, Raja clavata L. 1758 (Rajformes, Rajidae), coming from two contiguous areas of the Strait of Sicily (Central Mediterranean Sea) were analysed in order to discriminate the stocks. The two investigated areas include bottoms off southern Sicily (I-G16) and bottoms further at large (O-G16). The density indexes, biomass indexes and occurrences were substantially lower in I-G16 than O-G16. On the contrary, the biological traits were more similar, although significant differences were detected in the sex ratio, in the median total length of all specimens, in the length frequency distribution, in the estimated maximum length and in the female length-weight slope parameter. The median length of fully mature specimens did not significantly differ between the two areas. The von Bertalanffys asymptotic length and the ratio of total mortality/von Bertalanffys curvature parameter suggest a total mortality higher in the I-G16 than the O-G16 populations. This article supports the hypothesis that the investigated populations, in spite of a similar original life cycle, have evolved in two distinct unit stocks as a consequence of the different fishing efforts and the low-intermingling rate between the two areas."
162,3839,Game over! Wildlife collapse in northern Central African Republic,"The wildlife populations of northern Central African Republic (CAR) have long suffered intense uncontrolled hunting. Socio-political turmoil in northern CAR that started in 2002 resulted in a rebellion in 2006. An aerial sample count was carried out in northern CAR after the ceasefire to assess the impact of this troubled period on wildlife. The survey was flown at the end of the dry season in FebruaryMarch 2010. It covered a landscape complex of 95,000 km² comprising national parks, hunting reserves and community hunting areas. Comparison with earlier surveys revealed a dramatic; decline of wildlife: the numbers of large mammals fell by 94% in 30 years, probably due to poaching, loss of habitat and diseases brought by illegal movements of cattle. Elephant (Loxodonta africana), Reduncinae and topi (Damaliscus lunatus) populations showed the greatest decline (each over 90%). Other species declined by 7080% during the same period. The future of wildlife in this area is dark without a strong commitment to provide adequate funding and quickly implement of determined field management. Reinforced cooperation with neighbouring Chad and Sudan is required since they are facing similar problems."
163,3672,The rise and fall of the Aldabran giant tortoise population,"At the end of the 19th century, after prolonged and extensive harvesting, indigenous giant tortoises had been eliminated from all islands in the Indian Ocean, except Aldabra atoll, where only a few survived. With greatly reduced levels of exploitation during the 20th century, the population recovered to a revised estimated total of 129 000 in 1973 to 1974, when the first sample census was conducted. A repeat census in 1997 revealed a highly significant reduction in numbers over the past 24 years to an estimated total of 100,000. The great majority of tortoises are still found at relatively high density in southeastern Grande Terre, where the number of animals has declined by more than a third. In contrast, lowdensity subpopulations on Malabar and Picard have almost doubled in size, but they represent less than 5% of the total population. Corroborative evidence for the crash in the Grande Terre subpopulation comes from two independent observations: a significant increase in tortoise mortality; and a significant decline in tortoise counts on longterm population monitoring transects. These population changes are attributed to natural population regulatory mechanisms, exacerbated by low rainfall years in the period 1980 to 1997, including two consecutive years of below average rainfall in 1995 to 1996 and 1996 to 1997."
164,1016,The status and recent breeding performance of the critically endangered Northern Bald Ibis Geronticus eremita population on the Atlantic coast of Morocco.,"The main wild population of the Northern Bald Ibis Geronticus eremita breeds on the Atlantic coast of Morocco in the Agadir region. This paper describes the numbers of breeding pairs over the last two decades, the recent breeding performance, the causes of egg and chick losses and their conservation implications. Since 1980 there has been no overall decline in numbers with, over the last 5 years, 59-74 pairs breeding and a peak prebreeding population of around 220 birds. In contrast with the now extinct Northern Bald Ibis populations in Turkey and elsewhere in Morocco, the birds are present in the Agadir region throughout the year and do not appear to migrate from the area outside the breeding season. Breeding performance is highly variable from one year to the next but does not appear to be related to rainfall in the vicinity of the colonies as has been reported elsewhere. It is suggested that coastal fogs in this region may buffer the adverse impacts of low rainfall and may in part account for the year-round residency of the birds. The main causes of breeding failures have been loss of eggs to predators and, most importantly, poor chick survival as a result of starvation and predation. Conservation action to date has focused on reducing the negative influences on breeding success but it is recognized that for such a long-lived bird adult survival is also likely to be an important limiting factor on the population size."
165,2071,Human recreation and the nesting ecology of a freshwater turtle (Chrysemys picta),"Over a 3-year period, we studied the relationship between the intensity of human recreation and the nesting ecology of the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) at a major nesting beach. Our results suggest that the intensity of human recreation at this site had no effect on the decision of turtles to emerge from the water and nest, or on habitat selection by nesting turtles. This apparent lack of effect of human recreation is contrary to the results of many previously published studies on other taxa and underscores the variability in wildlife responses to human recreation and the need for species-specific and population-specific studies."
166,1893,Fluctuations in numbers of great white pelicans at Lake St Lucia in response to changing water-levels,"In January 2004, Lake St Lucia, a major part of the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park, was reduced to a fraction of its normal capacity as a result of a severe drought in this region of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. After rains in the area, the lake level rose and then fluctuated considerably over the next 42 months. During the first 38 months the mouth of the estuary into the sea was closed. The area entered a second severe period of prolonged drought from mid 2005 through to the spring of 2006. Great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus Linnaeus, 1758) numbers and lake levels were monitored during these 42 months. Pelican numbers were highly variable ranging from 0 to 6000. When lake levels were very low or too high, no pelicans were present. Pelican numbers appeared more indicative of food availability. Implications of these trends to the management of the lake and the conservation of the avifauna are discussed. It is suggested that the great white pelican could be used as an indicator species for the fish dynamics of the lake at medium to low lake levels. "
167,3300,Numerical response of fishers to synchronous prey dynamics,"Fisher (Martes pennanti) populations may respond numerically to fluctuating hare populations, although uncertainty remains about this contention. We analyzed livetrapping data from Ontario (448,654 trap nights) that contained trend information for fishers, lagomorphs (snowshoe hares [Lepus americanus] and eastern cottontails [Sylvilagus floridanus]), and North American porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) for 1995-2004. The data encompassed a synchronous fluctuation of lagomorphs and porcupines. Fisher populations appeared to have a delayed, positive numerical response with a lag of 2 years to changing lagomorph abundance, but they also appeared to switch to an unmeasured, alternate prey during the lagomorph low. This finding suggests that fishers are generalist predators that should have a stabilizing effect on the predator-prey system. "
168,3327,Spatial and temporal dynamics of small mammals at a regional scale in Canadian boreal forest,"Spatial synchrony is a common feature of mammalian population dynamics that appears to be caused by different processes in different systems. We sampled 60 sites across >900 km in northern and central Ontario, Canada, from 2001 to 2004 to assess spatial and temporal trends in abundance and population growth of small mammals. We tested alternative predictions for 3 causes of synchrony: dispersal, predation, and correlated environmental perturbations (the Moran effect). During 25,680 trap nights, Myodes gapperi, Tamias striatus, and Peromyscus maniculatus were the most commonly captured species. Populations of all 3 species fluctuated markedly during the 4 years of sampling, but fluctuations appeared to occur over a relatively small spatial extent (<200 km for all species). No pairwise combination of species exhibited positive interspecific synchrony, suggesting that nomadic predation was not synchronizing declines among species. Our data were most consistent with the dispersal hypothesis or a Moran effect caused through synchronous food crops. "
169,4443,Estimation of population size and trends for highly mobile species with dynamic spatial distributions," Aim To develop a more ecologically realistic approach for estimating the population size of cetaceans and other highly mobile species with dynamic spatial distributions. Location California Current Ecosystem, USA. Methods Conventional spatial density models assume a constant relationship between densities and habitat covariates over some time period, typically a survey season. The estimated population size must change whenever total habitat availability changes. For highly mobile long-lived species, however, densityhabitat relationships likely adjust more rapidly than population size. We developed an integrated population-redistribution model based on a more ecologically plausible alternative hypothesis: (1) population size is effectively constant over each survey season; (2) if habitat availability changes, then the population redistributes itself following an ideal free distribution process. Thus, the estimated relationship between densities and habitat covariates adjusts rather than population size. We constructed Bayesian hierarchical models corresponding to the conventional and alternative hypotheses and applied them to distance sampling data for Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), a highly mobile cetacean with distribution patterns closely tied to cool sea-surface temperatures. Results The Dall's porpoise data provided strong support for the hypothesis based on an ideal free redistribution process. Our results indicate that the population size of Dall's porpoise within the survey region was relatively stable over each summer/fall survey season, but the distribution expanded and contracted with the extent of suitable habitat. Over multiple survey seasons, the model partitioned variation in observed densities among three sources: variation in population size, the densityhabitat relationship and measurement error, leading to lower and more ecologically plausible estimates of interannual variation in population size. Main conclusions We conclude that the integrated population-redistribution model (IPRM) presented here represents an ecologically plausible model for use in future assessments of the population size and dynamics of cetaceans and other highly mobile long-lived species with variable spatial distributions."
170,1043,Status of southern elephant seals at South Georgia,"Approximately 54% of the world population of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) breeds at South Georgia. A partial survey in 1951 and a complete survey in 1985, together with counts at specific sites between these times, suggested that the population (around 100 000 breeding females) had not changed significantly in 34 years. This was in contrast to marked declines in most other populations. To examine this further, we conducted a third survey in 1995. This produced an estimate of 113 444 (s e = 4902) breeding females. Taking into account improved information about the behaviour of female elephant seals since the survey in 1985, there was no significant change in the number of breeding female elephant seals between 1985 and 1995. When combined with information from the 1951 survey, this supports the view that the total population size has not changed significantly during the past 45 years. Evidence for regulation of the population by environmental factors is equivocal. We hypothesize that the lack of any net change in population size may be linked to a limited availability of high quality breeding habitat."
171,4442,Abundance estimates for management of endangered false killer whales in the main Hawaiian Islands,": Effectively using the best available data to meet management mandates for endangered populations is a common conservation challenge. False killer whales <i>Pseudorca crassidens</i> occur as 3 distinct populations in Hawaiian waters, including a resident main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) population that is endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. A longitudinal, photo-identification dataset of 171 distinctive individuals and open mark-recapture methods were used to estimate current MHI false killer whale abundance as needed for management of this population. The data are from dedicated and opportunistic surveys conducted from 2000 to 2015 around the MHI and reflect unquantified spatiotemporal biases imposed by necessary sampling constraints. Accounting for temporal variation and especially social group affiliation was important in modeling capture probability. Sensitivity analyses found that the resulting time series of 16 abundance estimates is robust to some forms of sampling variability and bias. However, because the study area was partially sampled each year, the annual abundance estimates apply only to the portion of the population using the sampled area and may underestimate true population abundance. Nonetheless, the resulting estimates and supporting evidence indicate that the MHI false killer whale population is relatively small; for example, only 167 (SE = 23, 95% CI = 128-218) individuals were estimated to have used the sampled area in 2015. Until data are available to estimate or overcome sampling biases, this estimation framework offers a tool for using data that have been regularly collected each year to produce current abundance estimates that are improvements over existing management inputs."
172,2095,Population abundance and growth rate of western gray whales Eschrichtius robustus,"The western population of gray whales Eschrichtius robustus is one of the most endangered whale populations in the world. Recent studies of this population off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia, have produced a photographic dataset that was utilized for the first markrecapture assessment of western gray whale abundance. Given encounter histories of 129 individually identified whales spanning 25 monthly capture occasions from 1997 to 2003, a closed capture estimator was employed to estimate the number of individuals using the study area in each year. Temporary emigration probabilities were then applied to the closed capture estimates to enumerate the total population size of whales off northeastern Sakhalin Island. Total abundances from 1997 to 2003 were estimated as 64 [plus or minus] 5.1 (SE), 55 to 75 (95% CI); 75 [plus or minus] 4.9, 66 to 85; 86 [plus or minus] 3.1, 80 to 93; 77 [plus or minus] 4.7, 68 to 87; 91 [plus or minus] 3.4, 84 to 98; 98 [plus or minus] 4.1, 90 to 106; and 99 [plus or minus] 4.9, 90 to 109, respectively. These abundance estimates, particularly the last values in the series, most likely approximate the size of the entire western gray whale population. For comparison to the trend in the abundance estimates, life history data were used to estimate the growth rate of the population. Depending on the range of potential fecundity values incorporated, the resulting growth rate estimates indicate an annual population increase that is between 2.5 and 3.2%. The extremely small population size and slow rate of increase documented here further highlight concern about the viability of this critically endangered population."
173,839,Ecology of juvenile chinook salmon in a small non-natal stream of the Yukon River drainage and the role of ice conditions on their distribution and survival.,"We investigated the ecology of juvenile stream-type chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in Croucher Creek, a small non-natal tributary of the upper Yukon River, in 1998 and 1999. Underyearling (age 0+) salmon enter Croucher Creek from the Yukon River in June, and by midsummer reached an average density of >0.5/m2. Fish were most commonly found in small pools. Their mean size increased until the end of August, but growth virtually ceased after that, when water temperatures fell. Juveniles remained in the stream through winter, and their distribution and survival were strongly influenced by aufeis, a thick layer of ice that develops from the freezing of groundwater. Over-winter survival was not dependent on fish size. Those fish that survived the winter grew rapidly and doubled in body mass in the spring. About 900 yearling fish emigrated from Croucher Creek in late June and early July at a mean length of 89 mm and mass of 7.2 g. Most of the migrants overwintered in a 700 m long reach of the creek that was downstream from groundwater sources and did not experience severe icing conditions. We suggest that small streams may be important habitats for juvenile salmon in the Yukon drainage, especially if there is a year-round source of groundwater flow that creates conditions suitable for overwintering."
174,763,The fall and rise of bison populations in Wood Buffalo National Park: 1971 to 2003,"Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the decline of bison (Bison bison (L., 1758)) abundance in Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP). The ""disease-predation"" hypothesis proposes that tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis (Karlson and Lessel 1970)) and brucellosis (Brucella abortus (Schmidt 1901)) reduce bison survival and reproduction, resulting in a low-density, predator-regulated equilibrium. The ""habitat dispersion hypothesis"" proposes that bison in one area of WBNP, the Peace-Athabasca Delta (Delta), have an increased risk of predation because they are concentrated in large meadows with high temporal and spatial predictability. We incorporate bison census data, calf and yearling segregation counts, reproductive rates, adult survival rates, and adult disease incidence in a stochastic population model to show that the historical decline of bison in WBNP would have occurred regardless of disease prevalence. Our model shows that survival of juveniles, the age class that is least susceptible to disease effects, was likely an important determinant of historical changes in population size. We also demonstrate that the population decline was most pronounced in the Delta and that juvenile survival was lower in the Delta, despite evidence that disease incidence was lower in the Delta than in the rest of WBNP. Lastly, the current population trend in WBNP is one of rapid increase, even in the presence of disease. "
175,1731,Decline in whale shark size and abundance at Ningaloo Reef over the past decade: The world's largest fish is getting smaller,"Over-exploitation of whale sharks threatens the future of these wide-ranging pelagic fish. A long-term continuous record (4436 sightings) from a large aggregation (300-500 resident individuals) of whale sharks at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia shows that mean shark length declined linearly by nearly 2.0 m and relative abundance measured from ecotourism sightings (corrected for variation in search effort and environmental stochasticity) has fallen by approximately 40% over the last decade. This population-level result confirms previous predictions of population decline based on projection models parameterised using mark-recapture estimates of survival. The majority of these changes are driven by reductions in the number of large individuals in the population. Phenomenological time series models support a deterministic (extrinsic) decline in large females, although there was some evidence for density dependence in large males. These reductions have occurred despite the total protection of whale sharks in Australian waters. As this species is highly migratory, the rapid change in population composition over a decade (<1 whale shark generation) supports the hypothesis of unsustainable mortality in other parts of their range (e.g., overfishing), rather than the alternative of long-term abiotic or biotic shifts in the environment. As such, effective conservation of whale sharks will require international protection, and collaborative tagging studies to identify and monitor migratory pathways. "
176,3498,Evidence for increases in Antarctic Blue whales based on Bayesian modelling,"Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia) are the largest and formerly most abundant blue whale subspecies, but were hunted to near extinction last century. Estimated whaling mortality was unsustainable from 1928 to 1972 (except during 1942-1944), depleting them from 239,000 (95% interval 202,000-311,000) to a low of 360 (150-840) in 1973. Obtaining statistical evidence for subsequent increases has proved difficult due to their scarcity. We fitted Bayesian models to three sighting series (1968-2001), constraining maximum rates of increase to 12% per annum. These models indicated that Antarctic blue whales are increasing at a mean rate of 7.3% per annum (1.4%-11.6%). Informative priors based on blue whale biology (4.3%, SD = 1.9%) and a Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis of increase rates in other blue whale populations (-0.3%, SD = 11.6%), suggest plausible increase rates are lower (although the latter has wide intervals), but a meta-analysis of other mysticetes obtains similar rates of increase (6.7%, SD = 4.0%). Possible biases affecting the input abundance estimates are discussed. Although Antarctic blue whales appear to have been increasing since Soviet illegal whaling ended in 1972, they still need to be protected - their estimated 1996 population size, 1,700 (860-2,900), was just 0.7% (03%-1.3%) of the pre-exploitation level."
177,2377,,"The Eagle Owl has been considered extinct in Hesse. western Germany. since 1910. Reasons for its disappearance were mainly persecution by shooting, but also by egg collecting and 'trophy hunting' etc. As late as 1925 a pair of Eagle Owls was shot at Creuzburg near the border between Thuringia and Hesse. The main reasons for the reappearance of the Eagle Owl in Hesse are reintroduction programmes in adjacent regions like Lower Saxony and Northrhine-Westphalia. Through these successful programmes the Eagle Owl also reappeared in Hesse and bred for the first time successfully in 1977 in the district of Limburg-Weilburg. Since then numbers of breeding pairs increased slowly, but by 1985 had reached only four pairs. In the early 1990s a rapid growth started and in 1993 a total of 43 Eagle Owl territories were occupied with an average reproductive output of 1.93 young per pair. During the mid-1990s there was a decline in reproductive success in Hesse, the number of fledglings per pair dropped to 1.0-12. An exception was the Hessian Weserbergland with a rate of usually 2.0 young per pair. In the year 2000 the rate increased to 1.4-1.6 young per pair overall and the total population grew up to 58-60 pairs. Although shooting has been eliminated and pesticide contamination is of minor importance, many Eagle Owls are killed by collisions with wires, vehicles and by electrocution. Inbreeding depression - seriously discussed especially for the reintroduction project - did not play a role among captive-breeding Eagle Owls nor among the released birds. On the contrary the reintroduced Eagle Owls showed a high fitness, which was evident in a higher reproductive rate in the initial stage compared to other federal states (e.g. Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria and Thuringia). Competition for nest sites with other birds does not occur in Eagle Owls. because it is the dominant, prevailing species. I predict that the number of Eagle Owls in Hesse will increase further because there are still vacant potential breeding habitats. Eagle Owls show very high flexibility and are now by far less prone to disturbance than the founder population, plus they occupy more and more secondary breeding habitats."
178,3266,Responses of autumn staging waterbirds to wetland restoration and water levels in a Danish river delta,"A 2,200 ha wetland in the Danish Skjern River valley was restored between 1999-2002, partly to re-establish a rich community of migratory waterbirds, in a project which aimed to restore the nutrient retention capacity of the area and to improve its overall value for wildlife and humans. Numbers, distribution and foraging activity of waterbirds were monitored over the first four years after restoration, between late August and late November in 2002-2005. The restoration turned the western part of the project area into important feeding and roosting habitat especially for dabbling ducks, but also for herons, swans, coots and waders during their autumn migration. A total of 109 waterbird species were observed inside the restoration area. Dabbling ducks exploited the area extensively, with Wigeon Anaspenelope as the most numerous species reaching up to 12,600 individuals. There was no clear increase or decrease in the number of bird-days for geese, swans, dabbling ducks and Coot Fulica atra over the first four years after restoration, except for Gadwall A. strepera and Shoveler A. clypeata which were not numerous in the first autumn. The number of bird-days increased over the study period for three species of diving ducks and decreased for two species of waders. The proportion of dabbling ducks recorded feeding during the day was high in three years (range of annual means for six species = 29-76%) but low in one year (range = 9-44%). Many ducks also flew at dusk to feed in adjacent fields and other wetlands. In shallow lakes numbers of Coot and some species of dabbling ducks decreased with increasing water levels, whereas diving duck numbers increased. "
179,2439,Density dependence in a recovering osprey population: demographic and behavioural processes,"1. Understanding how density-dependent and independent processes influence demographic parameters, and hence regulate population size, is fundamental within population ecology. We investigated density dependence in growth rate and fecundity in a recovering population of a semicolonial raptor, the osprey Pandion haliaetus [Linnaeus, 1758], using 31 years of count and demographic data in Corsica. 2. The study population increased from three pairs in 1974 to an average of 22 pairs in the late 1990s, with two distinct phases during the recovery (increase followed by stability) and contrasted trends in breeding parameters in each phase. 3. We show density dependence in population growth rate in the second phase, indicating that the stabilized population was regulated. We also show density dependence in productivity (fledging success between years and hatching success within years). 4. Using long-term data on behavioural interactions at nest sites, and on diet and fish provisioning rate, we evaluated two possible mechanisms of density dependence in productivity, food depletion and behavioural interference. 5. As density increased, both provisioning rate and the size of prey increased, contrary to predictions of a food-depletion mechanism. In the time series, a reduction in fledging success coincided with an increase in the number of non-breeders. Hatching success decreased with increasing local density and frequency of interactions with conspecifics, suggesting that behavioural interference was influencing hatching success. 6. Our study shows that, taking into account the role of non-breeders, in particular in species or populations where there are many floaters and where competition for nest sites is intense, can improve our understanding of density-dependent processes and help conservation actions.

180,3009,"Detecting an increase in an Endangered huemul Hippocamelus bisulcus population following removal of cattle and cessation of poaching in coastal Patagonia, Chile.","The conservation of threatened species poses many challenges but through cooperation and pooling of resources, individuals and organizations can work together to achieve better results. Here we describe our experience, working through a governmental and private alliance, studying one of the most threatened mammals in the Southern Cone. The huemul deer Hippocamelus bisulcus, one of two members of the Hippocamelus genus of South America, is endemic to Argentina and Chile and currently inhabits only a small fraction of its former range. Little is known about the huemul because it generally lives in remote areas with a harsh climate and rugged terrain. Using drive counts and fixed width transects over 5 consecutive years (20042008) we estimated density and abundance, and examined population changes and social structure, in three coastal huemul populations in the area of the Témpanos and Bernardo fjords of Bernardo OHiggins National Park, Chile. Our results suggest that synergistic conservation actions, such as cattle removal and poaching control, can lead to the recovery of threatened huemul. The baseline information obtained from our surveys and the lessons learned through this governmental and private alliance will be useful for future monitoring of the huemul in the Patagonian fjords of Chile."
181,4314,"Distribuzione, consistenza ed evoluzione delle popolazioni di basettino Panurus biarmicus nidificanti in Italia nel periodo 1980-2006","In Italy the bearded parrotbill Panurus biarmicus nests mainly in the eastern part of the Po Valley, with some localized populations near the lakes of Tuscany (Chiusi, Montepulciano, Massaciuccoli) and of Umbria (Colfiorito and Trasimeno); the southern limit of its breeding range is around the coastal wetlands in Apulia (Lago Salso). At present, 85% of the population is concentrated in three regions (Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Emilia Romagna), the remaining 15% being in Lombardy, Tuscany, Umbria and Apulia. After an expansion that began in the '70s, in the late '90s this species has experienced a decline both in the breeding range and in the number of individuals; these phenomena got worse in the early 2000. In the period 2003-2006 the breeding population in Italy was estimated at 590-840 pairs, whereas in the mid '80s it had been estimated at 4,000-10,000 pairs (although we think these latter figures were too high). The negative trend could be accounted for, at least locally, the loss of suitable habitat (i.e. the burning of reedbeds in late winter, changes in water levels, and, lately, by the heavy presence of Myocastor coypus, which causes changes in the extent and structure of reedbeds). "
182,89,The Abundance and Conservation Status of Redshank Tringa totanus nesting on saltmarshes in Great Britain.,"We report the results of two surveys of the same sample of 77 saltmarsh sites around the coast of Great Britain, conducted in 1985 and 1996 to estimate breeding abundance and the conservation status (i.e. stable, increasing or declining) of redshank Tringa totanus nesting on saltmarshes. The 1985 estimate was 21 022 pairs (confidence limits: 14 941-26 818 pairs) and the 1996 estimate was 16433 pairs (confidence limits: 11 291-21 943 pairs). Saltmarshes, therefore, support c. 45% of the population of redshank breeding in Great Britain. We present evidence to show that these abundance estimates are unlikely to be biased as a result of poor regional or habitat coverage by the sample of sites surveyed. Comparison of breeding density changes within survey sites between 1985 and 1996 showed a significant mean decline of 10.98 pairs km-2 (confidence limits: 4.68-16.83 pairs km-2). This represented a loss of 4807 breeding pairs, i.e. a 22.9% decline in abundance. We suggest that conservation measures are needed, including the use of habitat creation for breeding redshank. A national assessment of the impact of current grazing practices on nesting redshank is also required as the basis for assessing which grazing practices are currently a threat, and of agricultural policy or conservation management measures to mitigate these."
183,4018,"Population ecology of Heteromys pictus (Rodentia: Heteromyidae), in a deciduous tropical forest with human disturbance, on the coast of Oaxaca, Mexico","Population ecology of Heteromys pictus (Rodentia: Heteromyidae), in a tropical deciduous forest with human disturbance, in Oaxaca coast, Mexico. Spiny pocket mice Liomys and Heteromys are forestdwelling; granivorous rodents distributed in seasonally dry forest or thorn scrub along the Pacific lowlands or xeric regions in the Mexican Plateau. We analyzed the population dynamics of the spiny pocket mouse Heteromys; pictus , in the coast of Oaxaca, Mexico, in two sites of tropical deciduous forest with different degrees of disturbance: ZPP = less disturbed site, and ZMP = more disturbed site. Two plots were established in each area with 66; trap stations? We used the capturerecapture; method and trapping for 12 periods for one year. Population density was estimated using the method of Minimum Number of Individuals Known Alive (MNKA). We; captured 706 individuals, 290 for the ZPP and 416 for the ZMP. The population density ranged from 28 to 142 ind./ha for both zones, but it was higher for the ZMP (54 against 142 ind./ha). The population density for both; areas increased during the rainy season and coincided with the increased recruitment of adults. Reproductive activity occurred throughout the study period in both areas, but it was higher for the ZMP. The sex ratio in the ZPP; was 1: 1 while in the ZMP was 1: 0.75. In the ZMP we found a higher population density and reproductive activity in females, compared to the ZPP. These results suggest that H.

184,3914,"Status, ecology and conservation of an endemic fish, Oreochromis niloticus baringoensis, in Lake Baringo, Kenya","1. The tilapia Oreochromis niloticus baringoensis is a genetically and morphologically distinct sub-species of; Oreochromis niloticus endemic to Lake Baringo, Kenya. In recent years, concern has been expressed as to its; status. Recent declines in catch returns suggest the population may be threatened, with conservation action; required to safeguard it.; 2. Catch returns from the Baringo fishery since 1964 have shown considerable fluctuations for all species, but; especially O. n. baringoensis. From a peak of 712 t in 1970, their total catch was only 5 t in 2005, despite a 2 year; period of closure in 2002 and 2003. Changes in fishery catch and relative abundance were independent of; exploitation in the fishery but were significantly correlated with lake level.; 3. Few individuals were captured at lengths 4250 mm, with no fish sampled 4284 mm. During periods of high; lake level, individuals matured at smaller sizes and were capable of growing to larger ultimate sizes. With; maturity at lengths o130mm and fishery regulations preventing removal of fish o180 mm, there was a relatively; large proportion of mature fish that was below exploitation size each year (19 to 44%). In most years, the; proportion of fish available for exploitation waso10%.; 4. Stable isotope analyses revealed O. n. baringoensis was reliant upon planktonic basal resources and; zooplankton carbon. There was only minimal trophic overlap with other fish species in the lake, indicating little; potential for competition for food resources.; 5. These data suggest that the population status of O. n. baringoensis is not threatened per se, but subject to an; unpredictable and unstable environment that strongly influences their life-history traits and, ultimately, their; population abundance, and should be managed accordingly."
185,1531,Estimating the number of green and loggerhead turtles nesting annually in the Mediterranean,"Most species of marine turtle breed every two or more years and it is the norm for females to lay more than one clutch of eggs within a nesting season. Knowing the interval between breeding seasons and the clutch frequency (number of clutches laid by an individual in a breeding season) of females allows us to assess the status of a nesting population. At Alagadi Beach, Northern Cyprus, over a period of 6 years (1995-2000), we attributed 96% of green Chelonia mydas and 80% of loggerhead Caretta caretta turtle clutches to known individual females. This intensive level of monitoring enabled us to estimate the clutch frequency for both species. Using four different methods we estimated clutch frequency to be 2.9-3.1 clutches per female for green turtles and 1.8-2.2 clutches per female for loggerhead turtles. The median interval between nesting seasons for green turtles was 3 years, and for loggerhead turtles it was 2 years. Utilizing these parameters and available data from other beaches that are monitored regularly, we estimate that there are 2,280-2,787 loggerhead and 339-360 green turtles nesting annually at these sites in the Mediterranean. This highlights the Critically Endangered status of this population of green turtles. Furthermore, as conventional beach patrols underestimate clutch frequency, these population estimates are likely to be optimistic. "
186,3800,Population recovery of black rhinoceros in north-west Namibia following poaching,"Curtailing overharvest, whether illegal or legal, is often a critical conservation objective. Yet even if overexploitation can be stopped, subsequent rates of population recovery can be highly variable due to Allee effects, alterations to age and sex structure and disruptions of animal social systems. Moreover, understanding the in?uence of density dependence can be dif?cult but important for long-term management. Here, we investigate the dynamics of black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis in the Kunene region of Namibia as they recover from illegal hunting. We use multi-strata markrecapture models to examine survival and stage-transition rates from 1992 to 2005. Survivorship estimates ranged from 0.793 for calves to 0.910 for adult males and 0.944 for adult females. The annual reproductive rate in adult females was estimated at 0.315. Model selection showed that these vital rates were time invariant, suggesting that Allee effects and transient dynamics did not have an important effect upon population dynamics, even in the early stages of recovery. Relative population density increased signi?cantly from 1992 to 2005 once illegal hunting had ceased in Kunene. However, the best-?t models did not include relative density in the estimation of survival or stage-transition rates. We then used the vital rates generated from our markrecapture analysis to build matrix projection models that assessed overall population dynamics. The female-only model gave a population growth rate estimate of l=1.011. Two-sex models suggest that the growth rate of the population could range from 0.990 to 1.012. The relatively slow growth rate of this population, even without hunting or density dependence, could stem from the low productivity of the region. Adult females had the highest reproductive value and their survival had the highest elasticity among vital rates. Translocating adult females would lead to the fastest initial population growth rate in founder populations but would have the most impact on the source population."
187,4267,Extreme rainfall-related clutch size variation in the Critically Endangered Raso Lark Alauda razae of the arid Cape Verde islands,"Summary The Raso Lark Alauda razae is a single island endemic confined to the island of Raso in the Cape Verde islands. It has been studied via short (11-20 day), similarly-timed visits every year from 2001 to 2017. These November/December visits have occurred towards the end of the main rainy period (August-October) in the Cape Verdes. Average clutch size ranged from zero (no nests found) to 3.57 in different years and was strongly correlated with rainfall in the three months preceding the year's visit, but not with population size, which varied 25-fold during the study period. Since the nomadic pursuit of rain is not an option for the Raso Lark, the species adjusts clutch size according to conditions prevailing on Raso."
188,2721,Large-scale noninvasive genetic monitoring of wolverines using scats reveals density dependent adult survival,"Noninvasive genetic monitoring has the potential to estimate vital rates essential for conservation and management of many species. In a long-term genetic capture-mark-recapture study using scats we evaluated temporal variation in adult survival in a wolverine (Gulo gulo) population in southern Norway. In contrast to most previous studies of large mammals we found evidence for negative density dependence in adult survival in this large carnivore. Both sexes showed the same pattern of density dependence, with higher annual survival rates in adult females than males. In addition, we also found an additive mortality effect of harvesting in the population, resulting in the lowest adult survival rates at a combination of high population density and high harvest rate. The additive effects of density and harvest on adult survival of wolverines have relevance to the conservation and management of solitary carnivores with strong intrasexual territoriality, especially for species where combats among conspecifics can cause serious injury or even mortality.

189,4445,Gray whale distribution relative to benthic invertebrate biomass and abundance: Northeastern Chukchi Sea 2009–2012,"The shallow continental shelf waters of the Bering and Chukchi seas are the northernmost foraging grounds of North Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus). Benthic amphipods are considered the primary prey of gray whales in these waters, although no comprehensive quantitative analysis has been performed to support this assumption. Gray whale relative abundance, distribution, and behavior in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (69°72°N, 155169°W) were documented during aerial surveys in June-October 20092012. Concurrently, vessel-based benthic infaunal sampling was conducted in the area in July-August 200910, September 2011, and August 2012. Gray whales were seen in the study area each month that surveys were conducted, with the majority of whales feeding. Statistical analyses confirm that the highest densities of feeding gray whales were associated with high benthic amphipod abundance, primarily within 70km of shore from Point Barrow to Icy Cape, in water <50m deep. Conversely, gray whales were not seen in 40-km×40-km cells containing benthic sampling stations with 85m?2 or fewer amphipods. Continuing broad-scale aerial surveys in the Chukchi Sea and prey sampling near feeding gray whales will be an important means to monitor and document ongoing and predicted ecosystem changes."
190,3661,Decline of Red-Eared Sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) and Texas Spiny Softshells (Apalone spinifera emoryi) in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas,"In 2009, we repeated a freshwater turtle survey first conducted in 1976 in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas to determine whether the abundance of freshwater turtles in the LRGV has changed over the past three decades. We captured significantly fewer red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) and Texas spiny softshells (Apalone spinifera emoryi) in 2 recently urbanized counties (Cameron and Hidalgo), and more red-eared sliders and Texas spiny softshells in a nonurbanized county (Willacy). Land-use changes, increased urbanization, and commercial turtle harvest are likely responsible for the decline of freshwater turtles in the LRGV. "
191,3654,The ecological impact of invasive cane toads on tropical snakes: Field data do not support laboratory-based predictions,"Predicting which species will be affected by an invasive taxon is critical to developing conservation priorities, but this is a difficult task. A previous study on the impact of invasive cane toads (Bufo marinus) on Australian snakes attempted to predict vulnerability a priori based on the assumptions that any snake species that eats frogs, and is vulnerable to toad toxins, may be at risk from the toad invasion. We used time-series analyses to evaluate the accuracy of that prediction, based on >3600 standardized nocturnal surveys over a 138-month period on 12 species of snakes and lizards on a floodplain in the Australian wet?dry tropics, bracketing the arrival of cane toads at this site. Contrary to prediction, encounter rates with most species were unaffected by toad arrival, and some taxa predicted to be vulnerable to toads increased rather than declined (e.g., death adder Acanthophis praelongus; Children's python Antaresia childreni). Indirect positive effects of toad invasion (perhaps mediated by toad-induced mortality of predatory varanid lizards) and stochastic weather events outweighed effects of toad invasion for most snake species. Our study casts doubt on the ability of a priori desktop studies, or short-term field surveys, to predict or document the ecological impact of invasive species."
192,4129,Frogs in the spotlight: a 16-year survey of native frogs and invasive toads on a floodplain in tropical Australia,"Although widespread declines in anuran populations have attracted considerable concern, the stochastic demographics of these animals make it difficult to detect consistent trends against a background of spatial and temporal variation. To identify long-term trends, we need datasets gathered over long time periods, especially from tropical areas where anuran biodiversity is highest. We conducted road surveys of four anurans in the Australian wet-dry tropics on 4637 nights over a 16-year period. Our surveys spanned the arrival of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina), allowing us to assess the invader's impact on native anuran populations. Our counts demonstrate abrupt and asynchronous shifts in abundance and species composition from one year to the next, not clearly linked to rainfall patterns. Typically, periods of decline in numbers of a species were limited to 1-2 years and were followed by 1- to 2-year periods of increase. No taxa showed consistent declines over time, although trajectories for some species showed significant perturbations coincident with the arrival of toads. None of the four focal frog species was less common at the end of the study than at the beginning, and three of the species reached peak abundances after toad arrival. Survey counts of cane toads increased rapidly during the initial stage of invasion but have subsequently declined and fluctuated. Distinguishing consistent declines versus stochastic fluctuations in anuran populations requires extensive time-series analysis, coupled with an understanding of the shifts expected under local climatic conditions. This is especially pertinent when assessing impacts of specific perturbations such as invasive species."
193,4194,Invader impact clarifies the roles of top-down and bottom-up effects on tropical snake populations,"Disentangling the effects of prey limitation (bottom-up) and predation (top-down) processes on natural populations is difficult, but the perturbations introduced by an invasive species can provide pseudo-experimental evidence on this issue. In tropical Australia, keelbacks (Tropidonophis mairii) and slatey-grey snakes (Stegonotus cucullatus) experience little direct cost or benefit from the arrival of toxic invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina), because they rarely eat toads and if they do, are relatively resistant to the toads' toxins. Nonetheless, these snakes could be affected indirectly by toad-induced decreases in the availability of prey (native frogs) and/or by fatal poisoning of the snakes' predators (large varanid lizards). The former (bottom-up) effect predicts decreases in snake body condition, feeding and growth rates after toads arrive, whereas the latter (top-down) effect predicts increases in survival. Our mark-recapture studies on these snakes in tropical Australia (for 7 years before and 7 years after toad arrival) reveal bottom-up effects both on an anurophagous dietary specialist (keelbacks) and a generalist feeder (slatey-grey snakes). Top-down effects of toad arrival were seen in keelbacks but not in slatey-grey snakes, perhaps reflecting the latter's larger body size. Indirect effects coinciding with the timing of toad invasion thus were mediated through changes in food supply for both native species and in rates of predation for one species. "
194,698,Temporal Changes in a Chihuahuan Desert Rodent Community,"Used time series analysis of 10 yr of monthly census data to assess the responses of both individual species and an entire community of rodents to a fluctuating desert environment. Dipodomys spectabilis and Perognathus flavus had pronounced annual cycles; D. ordii, D. merriami, Chaetodipus penicillatus, Onychomys torridus, O. leucogaster and Neotoma albigula exhibited annual cycles modified by interannual variation; and Peromyscus eremicus, Pm. maniculatus and Reithrodontomys megalotis showed little evidence of annual periodicity. Timing of annual cycles and the pattern of inter-annual fluctuations also differed among species, but 2 results that several species responded similarly to long-term environmental variation: 1) population densities of 4 species and total rodent biomass and numbers were positively correlated with the densities of annual plants; and 2) many pairs of species exhibited positively correlated population dynamics. Clustering of pairwise cross-correlation coefficients was used to identify sets of species with similar population dynamics. Detrended Correspondence Analysis identified 3 independent patterns of variation in species composition: a long-term trend; a 4-5 yr repeated pattern that appeared to correspond to the climatic effects of the El Nino Southern Oscillation; and an annual cycle. In general, species appeared to respond individualistically to environmental variation. -from Authors"
195,2114,"Abundance, movements, and feeding habits of Harbor Seals, Phoca vitulina, at Netarts and Tillamook Bays, Oregon","Harbor seal abundance at Tillamook Bay peaked during pupping (May-June) and molting (August) periods, while peak abundance at Netarts Bay coincided with the annual return (October-November) of chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta. Observations of seals preying on adult salmon resulted in estimated losses of 6.1, 7.2, and 1.5% of the total chum returns for 1978, 1979 and 1980, respectively, due to seal predation in the Whiskey Creek area. Pacific sand lance Ammodytes hexapterus was the most frequently identified prey item. Ten species of flatfish (Order Pleuronectiformes) were identified as harbor seal prey with Parophrys vetulus, Glyptocephalus zachirus, Citharichthys sordidus, Microstomus pacificus and Lyopsetta exilis ranking among the 7 most frequently occurring food items. In general, benthic and epibenthic fish appeared to be important in the harbor seal diet. Tagged harbor seals frequented at least 4 different estuaries and one coastal haul-out area, ranging from 25-550 km from the tagging area. -from Authors"
196,3230,Species loss and shifting population structure of freshwater turtles despite habitat protection,"Changes to population and community structure can have important ecological consequences and raise conservation concerns when causes are anthropogenic; however, signs of stress may not always be apparent. Turtles are long-lived and presence of adults may; suggest healthy populations when lack of recruitment is actually threatening persistence.; We observed and captured turtles for two years in Point Pelee National Park, Ontario, Canada,; and compared our results with those collected 30 years earlier to determine if (1) species; relative abundance, (2) sex ratios, and (3) age structure changed over three decades.; Extirpation of the spotted turtle since 19721973 has altered the parks species assemblage.; Evidence also suggests that Blandings turtles have declined. Sex ratios were similar; between time periods for all species except for the painted turtle which has become significantly; more male-biased. Size structure for Blandings and snapping turtles shifted; towards larger and presumably older age classes. Our results suggest that limited juvenile; recruitment caused the size shift. Heavy predation on turtle nests from a dense raccoon; population appears to be the main factor limiting recruitment. Despite protecting a sizable; fragment of turtle habitat for a century, Point Pelee has lost one species and only one other; species has a large healthy population. Our study illustrates that habitat protection provides; no guarantee for species persistence when multiple threats exist and highlights; the necessity for monitoring populations of long-lived species."
197,4190,"Segregation or aggregation? Sex-specific patterns in the seasonal occurrence of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias at the Neptune Islands, South Australia","The seasonal patterns of occurrence of male and female white sharks Carcharodon carcharias at the Neptune Islands in South Australia were reviewed. Analyses of a 14 year data series indicate that females seasonally aggregate in late autumn and winter coinciding with the maximum in-water availability of lactating female long-nose fur seals and seal pups. During this period, observed male:female sex ratios were similar; whereas during late spring and summer, males continued to visit, but females were rarely recorded. There was no evidence for segregation by sex or size at the Neptunes, but the highly focused seasonal pattern of occurrence of females compared with the year-round records of males suggests that there are likely to be differences between the sexes in overall distribution and movement patterns across southern Australia. It is suggested that foraging strategies and prey selection differ between sexes in C. carcharias across the life-history stages represented and that sex-specific foraging strategies may play an important role in structuring movement patterns and the sex ratios observed at such aggregation sites. Differences between sexes in distribution, movement patterns and foraging strategies are likely to have implications for modelling the consequences of fisheries by-catch between regions or jurisdictions and other spatially or temporally discrete anthropogenic effects on C. carcharias populations. Such differences urge for caution when estimating the size of C. carcharias populations based on observations at pinniped colonies due to the likelihood of sex-specific differences in movements and patterns of residency. These differences also suggest a need to account for sex-specific movement patterns and distribution in population and movement models as well as under conservation actions."
198,1302,The use of temporary removal sampling in a study of population dynamics of the salamander Desmognathus monticola. 2nd World Congress of Herpetology.,"  Temporary removal sampling was used to investigate the population dynamics of the salamander Desmognathus monticola in the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. Sampling was conducted over 5 years, mainly in July, on one or two plots each year, with seven removal samples being taken in each set of samples. By using size‐frequency distributions, it was possible to separately estimate population numbers for three juvenile age‐classes and a mixed age‐class of older individuals that included adults. Repetition of the procedure in successive years provided data for both time‐specific (vertical) and cohort life tables. Fecundity values obtained by dissection and age data derived by skeletochronology provided a means for refining the life table. The results confirmed and extended earlier findings of life‐history traits of D. monticola, and showed that annual survival rates of 0.5–0.6 are required for population equilibrium. Removal sampling is considered to be a promising technique for evaluating demographics in multispecies communities of desmognathine salamanders, but requires intensive sampling of relatively large plots over several years.

199,2309,"Large- and medium-sized ungulates in the Haut Niger National Park, Republic of Guinea: population changes 1997-2002","A census of ungulates was carried out in May 2002 in the Haut Niger National Park, Republic of Guinea. The study site was subdivided into three census blocks in which a total 111 transects (total length = 838.24 km) were censused once by one observer. Densities were estimated using DISTANCE analysis. We observed a total of 10 species of ungulates (nine Bovidae and one Suidae). Maxwell's duiker Cephalophus maxwelli had the highest density (3.69 individuals km-2) followed by the red-flanked duiker Cephalophus rufilatus (2.61 individuals km-2), whereas the buffalo Syncerus caffer had the lowest density (0.34 individuals km-2). Compared to a census in 1997, the abundance of red-flanked and Maxwell's duikers significantly decreased (by c. 50%) whereas that of other species remained stable or increased. This variation may possibly be explained by a change in the hunting pattern in the area, which shifted from large-scale hunting by large groups of hunters from outside the area before the Park's creation, to small-scale poaching by local hunters. The Park includes a diversity of ungulate species and harbours populations of ungulates that are important at both national and regional levels. We recommend therefore that the Park should be considered a key area for the conservation of ungulates in West Africa. "
200,4492,Long-term changes in species composition and relative abundance of sharks at a provisioning ,"Diving with sharks, often in combination with food baiting/provisioning, has become an important product of todays recreational dive industry. Whereas the effects baiting/provisioning has on the behaviour and abundance of individual shark species are starting to become known, there is an almost complete lack of equivalent data from multi-species shark diving sites. In this study, changes in species composition and relative abundances were determined at the Shark Reef Marine Reserve, a multi-species shark feeding site in Fiji. Using direct observation sampling methods, eight species of sharks (bull shark Carcharhinus leucas, grey reef shark Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, whitetip reef shark Triaenodon obesus, blacktip reef shark Carcharhinus melanopterus, tawny nurse shark Nebrius ferrugineus, silvertip shark Carcharhinus albimarginatus, sicklefin lemon shark Negaprion acutidens, and tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier) displayed inter-annual site fidelity between 2003 and 2012. Encounter rates and/or relative abundances of some species changed over time, overall resulting in more individuals (mostly C. leucas) of fewer species being encountered on average on shark feeding dives at the end of the study period. Differences in shark community composition between the years 20042006 and 20072012 were evident, mostly because N. ferrugineus, C. albimarginatus and N. acutidens were much more abundant in 20042006 and very rare in the period of 20072012. Two explanations are offered for the observed changes in relative abundances over time, namely inter-specific interactions and operator-specific feeding protocols. Both, possibly in combination, are suggested to be important determinants of species composition and encounter rates, and relative abundances at this shark provisioning site in Fiji. This study, which includes the most species from a spatially confined shark provisioning site to date, suggests that long-term provisioning may result in competitive exclusion among shark species."
201,2969,Seasonal and Long-Term Changes in Relative Abundance of Bull Sharks from a Tourist Shark Feeding Site in Fiji,"Shark tourism has become increasingly popular, but remains controversial because of major concerns originating from the need of tour operators to use bait or chum to reliably attract sharks. We used direct underwater sampling to document changes in bull shark Carcharhinus leucas relative abundance at the Shark Reef Marine Reserve, a shark feeding site in Fiji, and the reproductive cycle of the species in Fijian waters. Between 2003 and 2009, the total number of C. leucas counted on each day ranged from 0 to 40. Whereas the number of C. leucas counted at the feeding site increased over the years, shark numbers decreased over the course of a calendar year with fewest animals counted in November. Externally visible reproductive status information indicates that the species' seasonal departure from the feeding site may be related to reproductive activity. "

Information on the catch and biology of five shark species (Isurus oxyrinchus, Prionace glauca, Alopias superciliosus, Alopias vulpinus, and Sphyrna zygaena) is analyzed and contrasted with swordfish (Xiphias gladius) landings. A total of 51,205 fish were sampled, of which 40,198 were sharks, 9,990 swordfish, and the rest other bony fish.

We present information on population structures of the shark species, along with hypotheses about shortfin make movements as suggested by landing data."
203,4280,Seasonal movements in the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus abelii) and consequences for conservation,"Preservation of orangutan habitat can only be effective when their range requirements are taken into consideration. Here, the effect of the variation in fruit supply at different altitudes on the seasonal movements of orangutans is investigated. Transects were surveyed every 2 months from 1998 to 2000, at different altitudinal zones in the larger Ketambe area, Indonesia. The density of orangutan and sources of ripe fruit with soft pulp were determined along these transects. Both orangutan density and the availability of fruit varied considerably throughout the survey period at different altitudinal zones. The peaks in fruit production at different altitudes occurred in successive periods. For each altitudinal zone a significant correlation was found between orangutan density and the number of fruit sources, which shows that orangutans follow the production of fruit between these altitudinal zones within the boundaries of their home range. Orangutans with core areas in intermediate and highland areas depend seasonally on fruit production of lowland areas, and vice versa. Thus, conservation of large tracts of primary forest with a range of different altitudes is necessary to preserve the remaining orangutan population."
204,3052,"A Population Study of the Viviparous Australian Lizard, Trachydosaurus rugosus (Scincidae)","A population of the Australian scincid lizard Trachydosaurus rugosus, a large species whose adult snout-vent length can exceed 30 cm, was studied at Tickera in South Australia between 1975 and 1982. The population density remained relatively stable at 2-3 lizards/ha over the study period. The majority of recaptured lizards were within 100 m of their original capture site, even over periods of 6 yr between captures. Each year a proportion of the population consisted of new adults moving through the area. Mating occured in spring (Sept.-Nov.), which was also the time when lizards were most active. Live young (1-3 per female) were born the following autumn (Feb.-March). Growth rate data from recaptured individuals indicated that a lizard can reach maturity by its third spring season at an approximate age of 30 mo. Longevity could not be assessed, but many lizards were at least 9 yr old by the end of the study."
205,1918,"The ecology and conservation of reptiles on Round Island and Gunner's Quoin, Mauritius","The reptile communities on two islands off the north coast of Mauritius are described. One of these islands, Round Island, is the last refuge for four species: Phelsuma guentheri, Leiolopisma telfairii, Bolyeria multocarinata and Casarea dussumieri, which together with four more species form a relict herpetofauna of great scientific and conservation interest. The reptile fauna of the neighbouring island of Gunner's Quoin has been reduced to four species, probably because of habitat destruction and the effects of ship rats Rattus rattus. Round Island has also suffered habitat destruction through introduced mammals but because of its remoteness, rats are absent. Conservation of the Round Island ecosystem is discussed; removal of the remaining alien herbivores, the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and conservation education about Round Island are the main recommendations."
206,1592,"Resource Partitioning in Sympatric Cynopterus bats in Lowland Tropical Rain Forest, Thailand","Diet and habitat use of the closely related and size-overlapping sympatric Cynopterus brachyotis and C. sphinx were established in lowland dry evergreen forest, Thailand, between March 1998 and March 2000. Feces from netted bats were analyzed, and the recapture rate determined. Although both species share a set of food plants, and fruits from early successional forest contribute about half of their diet, C. brachyotis, the smaller of the two species, ate a significantly greater proportion of fruits from early successional forest than C. sphinx. The latter ate a significantly greater proportion of fruit species in larger size classes. More C. brachyotis were captured in early successional forest in almost every month, while C. sphinx is more common in old-growth forest. However, the capture rate of C. sphinx increased in early successional forest in the mid-dry season when its preferred fruits become available. The recapture rate of C. brachyotis in early successional forest was significantly higher than that of C. sphinx, and the reverse situation was observed in old-growth forest. Male C. sphinx had a significantly higher recapture rate in early successional forest than females. Fruit size and habitat use are the major determinants of resource partitioning between these size-overlapping congeners. "
207,4422,"The importance of protected and unprotected areas for colony occupancy and colony size in White-necked Picathartes Picathartes gymnocephalus in and around Gola Rainforest National Park, Sierra Leone","Summary Most attention on tropical biodiversity conservation has focussed on protected areas. Recognising and enhancing the value of biodiversity outside, as well as inside, protected areas is increasingly important given recognition that biodiversity targets will not be met through protected areas alone. We investigated the extent to which protection influences colony occupancy and colony size of a species of conservation concern, the rock-nesting White-necked Picathartes Picathartes gymnocephalus. We used mixed models to compare long term trends at 42 colonies located both inside and outside a protected area of forest, Gola Rainforest National Park, and considered colonies further inside the boundary as being better protected. Colony occupation was primarily predicted by the level of protection, with occupation highest within protected areas, but was not different between colonies situated close to or far from the boundary. Mean colony occupation was consistently high in protected areas, and lower in unprotected areas. The surface area of colony rocks was also an important predictor with larger rock faces having a higher probability of occupancy. Our best models also included distance to forested habitat, presence of cleared forest and evidence of hunting as less important predictors. Over the eight-year study, after controlling for rock surface area, active colony size declined significantly. However, declines were only significant in colonies in unprotected forest, whilst colonies located within protected areas were buffered from significant decline. Together this suggests colony occupancy and the number of active nests are influenced by protection and human disturbance. Although a lack of demographic and population dynamic work on picathartes prevents identifying mechanisms, we show that despite unprotected colonies having lower occupancy and fewer active nests they can persist in human altered and disturbed areas, partly because larger traditionally used rocks remain important nesting sites."
208,1772,,"We monitored 11 populations of eight species of Eleutherodactylus in Puerto Rico from 1989 through 2001. We determined relative abundance of active frogs along transects established in the Caribbean National Forest (El Yunque), Carite Forest, San Lorenzo, and in the vicinity of San Juan. Three species (Eleutherodactylus karlschmidti, E. jasperi, and E. eneidae) are presumed to be extinct and eight populations of six different species of endemic Eleutherodactylus are significantly declining at elevations above 400 m. Of the many suspected causes of amphibian declines around the world, we focused on climate change and disease. Temperature and precipitation data from 1970-2000 were analyzed to determine the general pattern of oscillations and deviations that could be correlated with amphibian declines. We examined a total of 106 tissues taken from museum specimens collected from 1961-1978 and from live frogs in 2000. We found chytrid fungi in two species collected at El Yunque as early as 1976, this is the first report of chytrid fungus in the Caribbean. Analysis of weather data indicates a significant wanning trend and an association between years with extended periods of drought and the decline of amphibians in Puerto Rico. The 1970's and 1990's, which represent the periods of amphibian extirpations and declines, were significantly drier than average. We suggest a possible synergistic interaction between drought and the pathological effect of the chytrid fungus on amphibian populations."

210,3040,The Nassau Grouper Spawning Aggregation Fishery of the Cayman Islands – An Historical and Management Perspective,"The reproductive characteristics of mass spawning at predictable times and; places have made the Nassau grouper, Epinephelus striatus, vulnerable to over; fishing. Historically in the Cayman Islands, five Nassau grouper spawning; aggregations provided an important seasonal artisanal fishery for local fishermen; from which fish were harvested by the thousands. In 1986, fishermen; began complaining of reduced catch and size of fish taken from the fishery.; Since 1987, the fishery has been monitored. Data on age, size, catch, and; catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was collected. Fifty-two percent of fish aged; were seven and eight years old, indicating full recruitment to the fishery by this; age. Analyses of data show overall declines in catch, CPUE, and size. In 2001; a sixth aggregation was discovered and heavily fished. In 2002, an Alternate; Year Fishing law was passed to reduce fishing mortality. In 2003, an 8-year; ban on fishing in all designated grouper spawning areas was implemented; when it became apparent that further fishing could irreversibly compromise the; viability of the new aggregation. Of the six known Nassau grouper spawning; aggregations sites in the Cayman Islands, three are fished out, two are in serious; decline, and one, though affected by fishing, is still comparatively healthy.; Additionally, two other areas were designated as potential spawning sites.

211,3066,"Population ecology, home Range, and seasonal movements of the Carolina diamondback terrapin, Malaclemys terrapin centrata, in Northeastern Florida","From May 1997 through March 1998 and from March 2000 through April 2001 my colleagues and I studied diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) in Duval and Nassau counties. We employed several capture methods, followed their movements with radio telemetry, and studied nesting and nest predation. We captured 173 previously unmarked females, 19 males, 2 juveniles, and 48 hatchlings. We also recaptured 52 females and 5 males. Combining measurements of these terrapins with others previously captured in the same area, mean plastron length for females was 162.2 mm, for males 102.5 mm, and for hatchlings 29.9 mm. Sex ratio was 1.33 males:1 female, and the population of females using the nesting beach is estimated to be 1,350.8. The most successful capture method was hand-capture at the nesting beach; however, we caught only females this way. Modified crab pots allowed capture of both sexes but produced fewer captives and was labor intensive. Cast netting was successful when terrapins were found in groups and were frequently surfacing. We equipped several females from both Deep Creek and the nesting beach with radio transmitters, monitored their activities, and established that the two sites represented separate populations. In at least 1 year, nesting beach terrapins spent the rest of the year in marshes and creeks 35 km upstream in the Nassau River. Deep Creek terrapins were downstream, near the Intracoastal Waterway, in April, May, and June. The rest of the year they were further upstream, and at least 1 wintered in the adjoining Garden Creek. Calculating the 95% isopleth, the mean female home range was 54.33 ha using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, 52.62 ha using the adaptive kernel (AK) method, and 236.92 ha using the fixed kernel (FK) method. For the 50% isopleth the values are 14.91 ha (MCP), 7.69 ha (AK), and 15.02 ha (FK). We used head counts (heads/minute) as a measure of terrapin activity in Deep Creek. No terrapins surfaced from December through February when water temperatures (TW) were 19°C or less. When TW was warmer highest head counts were recorded when salinity was moderate (1525 ppt). More heads were also recorded at higher TW and at lower tides. We recorded nesting from late April through late July. We found most newly deposited nests in May; however, crawl counts indicated that more terrapins visited the beach in June. Most depredated nests were found in June or July, and those from July included both newly deposited and recently hatched nests. Nests preyed upon in August and September were all recently hatched. Most nests were depredated within 24 hours of oviposition. The major nest predator was the raccoon (Procyon lotor), but we also noted crows (Corvus ossifragus and C. branchyrhynchos), boat-tailed grackles (Quiscalus major), an armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata). Hatching and emergence began in early July and continued into October. The mean emergence period for 54 nests was 68.9 days. In 1997, 21.9% of marked nests were washed out by high tides or storms, and in 2000, 8.9% suffered that fate."

Four passerine species and three species of waders constitute the commonest breeders. Significant decrease in numbers was found in the three commonest species, Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis (down 40 %), Northern Wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe (down 6567 %) and, in particular, Lapland Bunting Calcarius lapponicus (down 8287 %). The decline in Lapland Bunting is discussed in relation to changes in the vegetation on the breeding grounds probably caused by reduced grazing and climatic changes, and in relation to possible negative factors in parts of the wintering area."
213,2000,,"Every year, thousands of limicola and migratory birds winter on the South American coast, between September and April, where they acquire body mass and undergo moulting before returning to their reproduction sites. Qualitative and quantitative studies were performed in the Piaçabuçu Protection Area located in the state of Alagoas, Brazil, by direct counting, aiming to follow upon the birds' seasonal migration. Five species of Charadriidae family were recorded: Vanellus chilensis (Wagler, 1827); Pluvialis squatarola (Linnaeus, 1758); Charadrius semipalmatus Bonaparte, 1825; Charadrius collaris Vieillot, 1818 and Charadrius wilsonia (Ord, 1814), and five of the Scolopacidae family: Arenaria interpres (Linnaeus, 1758); Actitis macularius (Linnaeus, 1766); Catoptrophorus semipalmatus (Gmelin, 1789); Calidris pusilla (Linnaeus, 1766) and Calidris alba (Pallas, 1764). Pluvialis squatarola, Charadrius semipalmatus, Charadrius collaris, Arenaria interpres, Calidris pusilla and Calidris alba were considered constant (present in over 50% of observation time). Charadrius semipalmatus and Calidris alba showed highest level of frequency during November and December and March and September, respectively. Spearman correlation shows a strong dependency on migration of this species. The birds' loyalty to the Piaçabuçu area seen in this research show that this is a preferred site for wintering thus reinforcing its importance for the conservation of the migratory species that utilize the site."
214,170,Recovery within a population of the Critically Endangered citron-crested cockatoo Cacatua sulphurea citrinocristata in Indonesia after 10 years of international trade control,"Moratoria on international trade are frequently used to protect threatened species but few studies have examined their effectiveness in allowing populations to recover. We present population data collected before and after a moratorium on trade in the citron-crested cockatoo Cacatua sulphurea citrinocristata, a distinctive subspecies of the yellow-crested cockatoo endemic to Sumba, Indonesia. Before legal trade ceased in 1993 numbers of cockatoos leaving Sumba averaged c. 1,600 per year, and the 1992 population, estimated at 3,200, surely could not sustain such a level of trade. We surveyed cockatoos in four forest patches on Sumba in 1992, and then surveyed these same forest patches 10 years later, using the same field methods. Forest cover within the four patches was similar between years. We recorded a statistically significant increase in overall cockatoo density, from c. 2 birds per km2 in 1992 to >4 per km2 in 2002. Group sizes were also larger in 2002 than in 1992. Densities at two forest sites had increased considerably, at another the population was stable, but at one small forest patch a small population in 1992 had probably decreased. While the population has made a modest recovery, densities remain low compared to cockatoo populations elsewhere. Illegal trade is known to persist and its volume should be monitored closely. "
215,2099,Distribution and abundance of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and other marine mammals off the northern Washington coast,"We examined the summer distribution of marine mammals off the northern Washington coast based on six ship transect surveys conducted between 1995 and 2002, primarily from the NOAA ship McArthur. Additionally, small boat surveys were conducted in the same region between 1989 and 2002 to gather photographic identification data on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) to examine movements and population structure. In the six years of ship survey effort, 706 sightings of 15 marine mammal species were made. Humpback whales were the most common large cetacean species and were seen every year and a total of 232 sightings of 402 animals were recorded during ship surveys. Highest numbers were observed in 2002, when there were 79 sightings of 139 whales. Line-transect estimates for humpback whales indicated that about 100 humpback whales inhabited these waters each year between 1995 and 2000; in 2002, however, the estimate was 562 (CV=0.21) whales. A total of 191 unique individuals were identified photographically and mark-recapture estimates also indicated that the number of animals increased from under 100 to over 200 from 1995 to 2002. There was only limited interchange of humpback whales between this area and feeding areas off Oregon and California. Killer whales were also seen on every ship survey and represented all known ecotypes of the Pacific Northwest, including southern and northern residents, transients, and offshore-type killer whales. Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) were the most frequently sighted small cetacean: abundance was estimated at 181-291 individuals, except for 2002 when we observed dramatically higher numbers (876, CV=0.30). Northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus) and elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) were the most common pinnipeds observed. There were clear habitat differences related to distance offshore and water depth for different species."
216,2930,Reintroduction of roe deer Capreolus capreolus into a Mediterranean habitat: female mortality and dispersion,"During 1995-1997, 52 male and 52 female roe deer Capreolus capreolus, captured in the Forest of Trois-Fontaines in northeastern France, were introduced into the Petit Luberon state forest in southern France; of these 49 females (21 young that were < 1 year old and 28 adults that were > 1 year old) were monitored by radio-tracking. The overall mortality rate among the females monitored was 47% within one year of release. The first month following the release (February) was critical for the success of the operation as 35% of introduced animals died within this time span. It appears that stress was a major cause of mortality at this time, but traumatic deaths caused by drowning, collision with cars, and falling off cliffs were also frequent. The survival rate increased to 0.9 in spring, summer and early fall and decreased again during late fall and early winter. The high mortality rate occurring during this period may be explained by an increased mobility resulting from disturbance from wild boar Sus scrofa hunting. After the reintroduction, the animals stayed close to the release site (50% within 2.4 km, and 75% within 4 km), though the adults established themselves at longer distances than the young. The dispersion pattern of the females was not uniform throughout the study area: they preferentially settled down northwest of the release site, which may be explained by the topography of our study area and by the absence of human structures (roads, canals) in this area.

217,4205,"The Past and Present Nesting Ecology of Nile Crocodiles in Ndumo Game Reserve, South Africa: Reason for Concern?","Knowledge of the distribution and abundance of crocodilian nests and threats facing them is essential in calculating recruitment and determining population trends. We studied the nesting ecology of the Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) at Ndumo Game Reserve (NGR) in northeastern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa from 2009 to 2012. Nesting effort in NGR was comparable to other C. niloticus populations at 18-22%. Historical data suggest that high water levels completely inundate nesting sites within the reserve once every 10 yr, whereas predation destroys on average < 20% of nests annually and can be primarily attributed to water monitor lizards (Varanus niloticus). The number of crocodile nests located in NGR remained similar from 1964-2012 despite significant increase in population size. Earlier stocking programs increased the number of C. niloticus in the greater Maputo/Phongola floodplain areas, but these numbers may not be sustainable because the majority of C. niloticus nests appear to be outside of the reserve in unprotected areas."
218,4116,Comparison of pellet-group counting methods to estimate population density of white-tailed deer in a Mexican tropical dry forest,"Wildlife species population density estimation is important from both ecological and management perspectives. The pellet-group counting method has been used to evaluate density of the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). This species is an important component of human diet in tropical habitats. The objectives of this study were to: 1) compare density estimates using four methods: counts in circular plots (FSC, Fecal Standing Crop and FAR, Fecal Accumulation Rate), and counts in transects (LT, Line Transect and ST, Strip Transect); 2) simulate the effect of increased sampling effort on density and precision, and; 3) evaluate the effort required to detect changes in population density using LT. From 2006 to 2007, we intensively sampled a 1 km2 quadrant in a Mexican tropical dry forest. The results indicate that all four methods produce similar mean population density estimates. However, estimates of precision were dependent on sample size which in turn was associated with the particular counting method used. In descending order of estimate precision, the methods ranked as: LT, ST, FSC, and FAR. To detect population changes of < 20%, we suggest the establishment of 5 to 22 transects (LT) of 390 m during the dry season. To reduce bias in density estimation, it is important to obtain defecation and pellet decomposition rates in the study site"
219,2924,"Recent status and trends of the land bird avifauna on Saipan, Mariana Islands, with emphasis on the endangered Nightingale Reed-warbler Acrocephalus luscinia","The avifauna of the Mariana Islands, an archipelago in the western Pacific, faces the threats of rapid economic development and the spread of non-native species, particularly a devastating predator, Brown Tree Snake Boiga irregularis. In this paper, we examine the status and trends of the land bird fauna of Saipan Island based on three island-wide surveys conducted in 1982, 1997, and 2007. During this period, the human population on Saipan increased more than four-fold and much of the island has been developed. The surveys employed standard point-transect methods based on Distance Sampling. Remarkably, we found nearly all species of land birds - 11 native species and three introduced species - to be common or abundant. The exception was the Micronesian Megapode Megapodius laperouse, a historically rare species that was not observed on the 2007 survey, although it does persist on Saipan and other Mariana islands. A comparison of species densities among the three surveys showed that seven species, mainly fruit and seedeaters, had increased and three species of insectivorous birds had decreased - Rufous Fantail Rhipidura rufifrons, Nightingale Reed-warbler Acrocephalus luscinia, and Golden White-eye Cleptornis marchei. Of these three, Nightingale Reed-warbler is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and as an Endangered Species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Reed-warbler densities on Saipan decreased by more than half between 1982 and 2007. Although point transect sampling worked well for this species, density estimates and trends assessment could be improved by reallocating sampling stations among habitats and by more frequent sampling."
220,4013,"Suitability of poplar plantations for a cavity-nesting specialist, the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor, in the Mediterranean mosaic landscape","Monocultures of even-aged trees in short rotation are a forest system of low ecological complexity that has; been described as unsuitable for the establishment of stable populations of forest birds. However, key habitat quality; cues could make them attractive to forest specialists. This paper assesses the suitability of poplar plantations in the; northeast of the Iberian Peninsula for a forest specialist, the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor. Poplar; stands occupy a small area of an agroforestry mosaic landscape where semi-natural Mediterranean woodland is predominant.; Population size, nesting success, home ranges and habitat selection were studied by radio-tracking and monitoring; during the breeding season and the winter. Poplar plantations were preferentially selected for breeding and foraging; in the spring and the winter. Home ranges in the breeding season and the winter (32.4 and 438.5 ha, respectively); were similar to those observed in semi-natural woodlands that have been studied in Europe. However, population; density (0.25 territories/100 ha) was lower than that described in most European semi-natural woodlands. Nesting success; was low (0.54), due to strong competition with other cavity nesters, predation of nests by the Greater Spotted; Woodpecker, and loss of one of the adults. Fifty per cent of the foraging activity during the breeding season took place; in an area of 180 metres around the nest. The amount of standing dead wood in poplar stands was much higher than; in the surrounding habitats and source areas. The moderate breeding success and the high rate of adult predation may; suggest that poplar plantations act as an ecological trap, in which standing dead wood may be a habitat quality cue that; attracts birds to this non-ideal habitat. Poplar plantations become even less suitable when most of the available habitat; is felled at the same time. Suitable planning of poplar plantation rotations and recovery of riparian forest is the best way; to ensure the survival of Lesser Spotted Woodpecker populations in the long term."
221,2494,Model-based abundance estimates for bottlenose dolphins off southern Spain: implications for conservation and management,"An EU-funded Life project was initiated off southern Spain in 2002, with the objective of developing a Conservation Plan for bottlenose dolphins in the area. Baseline information and monitoring of abundance and distribution is needed to determine if the conservation objectives are met in the long-term. To estimate abundance, 12,568km of non-systematic line transects conducted from 2000 to 2003, with 72 sightings, were analysed using spatial modelling methods. Transects were divided into 4,575 small segments (average 2.8km) with similar values for sightability conditions and environmental variables. The point estimate of bottlenose dolphin abundance in the area was 584 dolphins (95% CI=278-744). The same method was applied to investigate changes in abundance since 1992 in the eastern section of the research area, where most dolphins were concentrated, stratifying by three groups of years. Point estimates were 111 dolphins for 1992-97, 537 for 1998-2000 and 279 for 2001-03. The higher abundance between 1998 and 2000 corresponded with the observation of an 'immigrant' group of dolphins in these years. These results highlight the importance of longterm studies to understand natural variation in abundance in a specific area subject to conservation activities."
222,1473,A review of sea turtle nesting activity along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey,"Many parts of the Turkish coastline are important nesting grounds for sea turtles. The aim of this study was to assess the present state of sea turtle populations along the coastline of Turkey, by evaluating research conducted at various nesting grounds from 1979 to 2000. The results of the evaluation indicate that the Turkish coastline is the most important nesting area for Chelonia mydas, and the third most important nesting area for Caretta caretta after Greece and Libya (if nesting estimates for Libya are correct) in the entire Mediterranean. The most important C. caretta nesting beaches in Turkey are Dalyan (11.9%), Kumluca (11.3%), Belek (27.9%), Kizilot, (8.9%) and Anamur (8.8%), while those for C. mydas are Kazanli (24.1%) and Akyatan (54.4%). These sites are classified as ""Nesting Areas of 1st Degree Importance"". Annual mean nest numbers along the coastline of Turkey are estimated to be ca. 2000 for C. caretta and 650 for C. mydas. Assuming that each adult female sea turtle nests three times per season, the annual numbers of nesting females along the beaches of Turkey range between about 500 and 800 for C. caretta and 130 and 300 for C. mydas. Annual nesting densities along the 204 km beach strip, which includes 17 important nesting grounds in Turkey, were 11.3 nests/km for C. caretta and 19.2 nests/km for C. mydas. "
223,892,Status of an endangered subspecies: The peninsular pronghorn at Baja California,"During November 1993, we traversed by ground and by air the Vizcaino Desert, the last redoubt of the peninsular pronghorn (Antilocapra americana peninsularis). A total of 29 h of aerial census was performed and a total of 1900 km2 were covered by ground, totalling 400 man hours of survey. At present the peninsular pronghorn population consists of 175 individuals, and inhabits an area of approximately 5000 km2. Because of the impossibility of controlling its activities over such an area and because of the present small population size, we propose to manage part of the population in semicaptivity at Mesa de la Choya island, with the objective of assuring the survival of this subspecies, the most endangered mammal in Mexico."
224,2664,Assessing population parameters and trends of Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis): An eight-year mark-recapture study,"This study represents the first attempt to study the population dynamics of Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis), by evaluating a set of demographic parameters. The population of the Caravelas River estuary, eastern Brazil, was systematically monitored through a long-term mark-recapture experiment (2002-2009). Abundance estimates revealed a small population (57-124 dolphins), comprised of resident dolphins and individuals that temporarily leave or pass through the study area. Temporary emigration from the estuary to adjacencies (γ″= 0.33 ± 0.07 SE) and return rate (1 -γ′= 0.67) were moderate and constant, indicating that some dolphins use larger areas. Survival rate (φ= 0.88 ± 0.07 SE) and abundance were constant throughout the study period. Power analysis showed that the current monitoring effort has high probability of detecting abrupt population declines (1 -β= 0.9). Although the monitoring is not yet sensitive to subtle population trends, sufficient time to identify them is feasible (additional 3 yr). Despite such apparent stability, this population, as many others, inhabits waters exposed to multiple human-related threats. Open and closed population modeling applied to photo-identification data provide a robust baseline for estimating several demographic parameters and can be applied to other populations to allow further comparisons. Such synergistic efforts will allow a reliable definition of conservation status of this species. "
225,4318,"Population size of endemic Rana tavasensis in its terra typica, Turkey","We applied capture-mark-recapture (CMR) methods to estimate the population size of the Tavas frog Rana tavasensis in its terra typica. For this purpose,we used Pollock’s robust design in program MARK in the 2011-2015 breeding seasons in its terra typica. Based on the selected model,equal catchability of each individual and absence of temporary migration were found to be the most likely biological hypotheses. Population sizes were estimated as 398,348,275,and 117 individuals during the four study years,respectively. Annual capture probabilities were estimated to average 0.07,and annual survival rates across years averaged 0.19. The year-specific estimations showed a remarkable decline in population size and survival rates. Anthropogenic factors,such as off-road activities,recreational activities,and animal grazing,might have played a role in this decline. This trend provides us with useful knowledge for conservation and management activities."
226,4430,"Changes in breeding population sizes of Double-crested Cormorants Phalacrocorax auritus in the Humboldt Bay area, California, 1924–2017","To better understand recent population growth of the Double-crested Cormorant Phalacrocorax auritus along the Pacific coast of North America, we assessed long-term breeding population trends in the Humboldt Bay area, California, using aerial photographic survey data collected since 1989 as well as available prior data. The earliest documentations of breeding (but without nest counts) are from 1924, 1943, and 1947 on the outer coast near Trinidad, and from 1959 in Humboldt Bay at Old Arcata Wharf. The breeding population increased from 188 nests (376 breeding birds) at one colony in 1961 to ~ 350 nests (700 breeding birds) at four colonies by 1980, and then to peaks of nearly 1 700 nests (3 400 breeding birds) in 1997 and 2004 at eight colonies. Breeding was documented at 13 coastal colonies through 2017. The population increased 100 % (9 % per annum) from 1989 to 1997, decreased during the strong 1998 El Niño, and rebounded by 2004. After the 2004 peak, three years of available data indicated slight population decline. For the entire 1989–2017 period, the population increased by 91 % (2 % per annum). Artificial habitats in Humboldt Bay allowed most of the population growth, especially Teal Island, which was colonized in 1993 and became the largest colony in all but one year thereafter. Nest totals on the outer coast decreased, likely because of movements to the Humboldt Bay colonies, which are closer to main foraging areas, and because of competition for nesting space with Common Murres Uria aalge at one colony (False Cape Rocks). Future growth of the population in the Humboldt Bay area appears limited by the availability of disturbance-free breeding habitat. Declines may occur if artificial habitats are lost."
227,4446,"Long-term trends in cetacean occurrence during the annual sardine run off the Wild Coast, South Africa","During the austral winter, cetaceans and other apex predators follow the annual northeastward movement of shoaling sardines, known as the sardine run, along the southeast coast of South Africa, including a 400-km stretch called the Wild Coast. In total, 131 opportunistic aerial surveys were conducted between May and July, from 1996 to 2014, to monitor sardine movement. Cetacean-sighting data from these surveys were analysed, focusing on long-term trends in frequencies of the cetaceans. In total, 630 sightings involving five cetacean species were recorded: 268 (approximately 32 400 individuals) of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus, 108 (approximately 79 400 individuals) of long-beaked common dolphin Delphinus capensis, 242 (approximately 670 individuals) of humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, 1 (two individuals) of southern right whale Eubalaena australis, and 11 (16 individuals) of Bryde’s whale Balaenoptera edeni. The occurrence of common dolphins, typically associated with sardines, decreased significantly in average group size over the study period (p = 0.0343); bottlenose dolphins, considered generalist feeders, demonstrated no such trend (p = 0.916). Humpback whales were most frequently sighted between 2010 and 2014, and with significantly larger groups observed towards the end of the study period (p = 0.0121). For all these species, more sightings were made inside than outside of marine protected areas (>70% of the dolphin species, and >65% of the humpback whales), both pre- and post-2005 (from 2005 the size of the survey area increased). The results indicate that movements of the common dolphin may be employed as a proxy for sardine occurrence. Long-term trends evident in the data also demonstrate the importance of this coastal region for bottlenose dolphins as well as use as a migratory corridor for humpback whales."
228,4319,Can intensive agricultural landscapes favour some raptor species? The Marsh harrier in north-eastern Spain,"Agricultural intensification over the last 60 decades has been linked to decreases in biodiversity and in the breeding populations of several avian species in farmlands. However, agricultural intensification has not affected all species in the same way and transformed landscapes can still provide suitable habitats for species tolerant to some degree of anthropogenic change. Understanding habitat selection in man-made landscapes is a pre-requisite to effective management and conservation of the species that use them. However, habitat-related choices made by individuals occupying these landscapes are often difficult to explain, as the cues they use may be decoupled from the ecological context in which they evolved. Here, we investigated nesting habitat selection in a ground-nesting raptor breeding mainly in wetlands, which, unlike many other species occupying farmlands, has experienced a population increase in some agricultural regions. We used multivariate analysis to assess the extent to which habitat characteristics, human disturbance or proximity to other occupied sites influenced nesting-site occupancy. Our results indicate that Marsh harriers occupied breeding sites according to habitat cues obtained at two complementary spatial scales (i.e. the breeding site and the foraging area). This study indicates that a raptor species that uses human-made structures such as ponds for breeding while exploiting their surrounding crops for hunting can take advantage of agricultural intensification. Environmental disturbances are often viewed only in terms of their harmful impacts on the affected species. However, human activities are causing many types of alterations in natural landscapes that can be exploited by certain species with positive responses towards these transformations. The adaptation of some raptors to human-altered environments, such as the Marsh harrier in our study area, raises doubts regarding the appropriateness of using such species as indicators of natural habitat quality.

229,4145,Distribution and feeding habitat characterization of whale sharks Rhincodon typus in a protected area in the north Caribbean Sea,"The relationship between the distribution of the whale shark Rhincodon typus and hydrobiological variables in the Caribbean Sea during 20052009 was analysed. Monthly trips were made to the R. typus aggregation area during the months when this species is present in the region (May to September) to record sightings and hydrological data and to collect samples to determine nutrients, chlorophyll a (Chl a) and zooplankton biomass. A total of 2104 R. typus were counted and three zones of high abundance were identified: Cabo-Catoche, Contoy (both within the Whale Shark Biosphere Reserve, WSBR) and the zone knows as Afuera. The zones of greatest R. typus density within the WSBR were characterized by high Chl a concentrations (median: 1·1 mg m?3, interpercentile range: 0·51·8 mg m?3) and high nutrient concentrations, such as ammonium (median: 2·5 µmol l?1, interpercentile range: 0·56·4 µmol l?1), due to the influence of local upwelling. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to explore the relationship between R. typus distribution and the environmental variables inside WSBR. Zooplankton biomass was the most influential environmental variable, supporting the close relationship between R. typus distribution and biological productivity. Copepods were the dominant zooplankton group within the WSBR. In the Afuera zone, there were large R. typus aggregations (>80 individuals) associated with zooplankton dominated by fish eggs and significantly higher mean ± s.d. biomass (3356·1 ± 1960·8 mg m?3) compared with that recorded inside the WSBR (103·5 ± 57·2 mg m?3). The differences among zones generated changes in R. typus distribution patterns and provided opportunities to develop local management strategies for this species."
230,3499,An index of abundance for coastal species of juvenile sharks from the Northeast Gulf of Mexico,"A fishery-independent assessment of juvenile coastal shark populations in U.S. waters of the northeast Gulf of Mexico was conducted using two methods: gillnets and longlines. Surveys were conducted monthly during April-October in two fixed sampling areas from 1996 to 1998. The Atlantic sharp-nose shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, and the blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus, were the most common species captured with either longlines or gillnets. An additional 14 shark species were captured, and juvenile indices of abundance were developed for 8 species with gillnets and 6 species of sharks with longlines. Trends in catch-per-unit-effort were found to vary depending on species. Length-frequency information revealed that the majority of sharks captured were juveniles. Given the direct relationship between stock and recruitment for sharks, continued monitoring of juvenile abundance will aid in determining the strength of the parental stock size and for predicting future population strength."
231,4476,Relative abundance and size of coastal sharks derived from commercial shark longline catch and effort data,"In the north-west Atlantic Ocean, stock assessments conducted for some commercially harvested coastal sharks indicate declines from 64 to 80% with respect to virgin population levels. While the status of commercially important species is available, abundance trend information for other coastal shark species in the north-west Atlantic Ocean are unavailable. Using a generalized linear modelling (GLM) approach, a relative abundance index was derived from 1994 to 2009 using observer data collected in a commercial bottom longline fishery. Trends in abundance and average size were estimated for bull shark Carcharhinus leucas, spinner shark Carcharhinus brevipinna, tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier and lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris. Increases in relative abundance for all shark species ranged from 14% for C. brevipinna, 12% for C. leucas, 6% for N. brevirostris and 3% for G. cuvier. There was no significant change in the size at capture over the time period considered for all species. While the status of shark populations should not be based exclusively on abundance trend information, but ultimately on stock assessment models, results from this study provide some cause for optimism on the status of these coastal shark species."
232,4431,"Long-term changes in population size, distribution and productivity of skuas (Stercorarius spp.) at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands","In this study, we investigate the numbers, productivity and territory distribution of the two species of skuas (brown Stercorarius lonnbergi and south polar Stercorarius maccormicki) breeding at Signy Island, South Orkneys, and compare the results with trends elsewhere. Comparison with previous counts indicates a biphasic increase in brown skuas at Signy Island; much faster from 1958/1959 to 1982/1983 (3.3 % per annum), than in subsequent years (0.4 % per annum from 1983/1984 to 2013/2014). Relative distribution of territories has changed little over time. The reduced rate of population growth in recent years was broadly coincident with a decrease in numbers of penguins (and therefore potential prey), which may also explain recent reductions in skua numbers at other Antarctic sites. As prey have become limiting, breeding success of brown skuas at Signy Island is now slightly lower than in the 1950s/early 1960s, but timing of breeding does not appear to have changed. Brown skuas at Signy Island may still have enough resources to start breeding, but as the season progresses and availability of resources declines, chick survival is reduced. South polar skuas have declined from ten pairs in 1982/1983 to one pair in 2013/2014, and mixed pairs have increased from one to three pairs. A review of the literature indicated that although population trend data are available for relatively few sites elsewhere in the subantarctic and Antarctic, numbers of brown skuas appear to be generally decreasing or stable, and of south polar skuas to be stable or increasing."
233,2806,"On the merits and feasibility of wildlife monitoring for conservation: a case study from Katavi National Park, Tanzania","Although long-term monitoring is viewed as an essential part of conserving wildlife populations, it is currently carried out in surprisingly few protected areas in Africa. Here, data from a 16-year vehicle transect monitoring programme in Katavi National Park, western Tanzania, are presented. These data provide information on large mammal densities, identify declines in populations of several large mammal species as based on encounter rates, support worrying trends observed in aerial census data and shed light on the effectiveness of recent changes in legal protection. Ground and aerial surveys confirmed that waterbuck, topi, warthog, lion and spotted hyaena populations are all in decline and that this should be a cause for concern. Counting animals by driving vehicle transects is relatively easy and inexpensive to carry out, and data here show that such counts have several pay-offs for conservation managers especially in identifying population declines; counts should be employed more often in East Africa and elsewhere."
234,1689,"Factors Affecting the Small Mammal Community Inside and Outside Katavi National Park, Tanzania'","Small mammal trapping showed that a minimum of 12 species live in and around Katavi National Park in western Tanzania. Species richness and abundance were greater outside the park than inside, extending results of an earlier study. Species richness and abundance were not significantly associated with vegetation cover or plant biomass but were negatively correlated with seed diversity, seed biomass, and possibly small carnivore abundance. Unfortunately, small mammal diets are unknown in this ecosystem and it can be argued that carnivores are unlikely to reduce species diversity, casting doubt on the importance of these variables. While the factors causing small mammals to fare poorly in this protected area are not yet understood, reduced food availability remains the best candidate."
235,4568,"Potential effects of global climate change on fisheries in the Trasimeno Lake (Italy), with special reference to the goldfish Carassius auratus invasion and the endemic southern pike Esox cisalpinus decline"," Global climate changes have led to a gradual warming of the planet, resulting in decreased precipitation and rising temperatures in Mediterranean inland waters. In Trasimeno Lake, the largest shallow lake in Italy, some non-native fish species have probably benefited from these changes as they are thermophilic and characterised by wider habitat preferences. Fish data collected by gillnets and fyke nets between 1956 and 2016, and by electrofishing in 1993 and 2014, were used to analyse changes over time in the fish community in relation to environmental conditions. An explosion in goldfish Carassius auratus (L.), following its introduction in 1988, coupled with water level fluctuations and reduced transparency, contributed to the reduction in commercial fish catch in the lake, and to the decline of the endemic southern pike Esox cisalpinus Bianco & Delmastro, already threatened by reduced spawning habitat and interspecific competition with other non-native predatory fishes."
236,2415,Density-dependent productivity depression in Pyrenean Bearded Vultures: Implications for conservation,"The main objective of many conservation programs is to increase population size by improving a species' survival and reproduction. However, density dependence of demographic parameters may confound this approach. In this study we used a 25-year data set on Bearded Vultures (Gypaetus barbatus) in Spain to evaluate the consequences of population growth on reproductive performance. Unlike its coefficient of variation (cv), mean annual productivity decreased with increasing population size. After controlling for territorial heterogeneity, productivity also was negatively related to the distance to the nearest. conspecific breeding pair and to supplementary feeding points where floaters congregate. These results suggest that vulture populations are regulated as posited by the site-dependency hypothesis: as the population increases, average productivity decreases because progressively poorer territories are used. The combined effects of the shrinkage of territories and the presence of floaters around supplementary feeding points seem to be the main causes of productivity decline and are therefore the main determinants of territory quality. This has conservation implications especially concerning the role of supplementary feeding points. Supplementary feeding should be reviewed given that its usefulness in reducing preadult mortality has not yet been proved and its effect on productivity, as our results suggest, is negative."
237,1564,Monitoring Mammal Populations in Costa Rican Protected Areas under Different Hunting Restrictions.,"It is necessary to assess whether the management of protected areas is achieving the objectives set for them. In particular, changes and trends in wildlife populations should be documented. We compared the 1990 abundance of mammals in two Costa Rican protected areas, Corcovado National Park (CNP) and Golfo Dulce Forest Reserve (GDFR), with similar environmental characteristics but different hunting restrictions and levels of protection. We also monitored the abundance of mammals in CNP over a 4-year period. We also devised an inexpensive method of monitoring tropical rainforest mammal populations in a timely and efficient manner. The method is based on the use of mammal track records and arboreal mammal sightings and requires little effort. With this method 20 mammal species were recorded at CNP and 15 at GDFR. Species were consistently less abundant in GDFR than in CNP, principally those species preferred by hunters. Species were grouped according to whether or not they are used as food and whether they are locally or globally threatened or not threatened. The abundance of all these groups of species in GDFR was 6-28% the abundance in CNP. During 1990-1994, overall mammal abundance in CNP remained relatively stable, but there was considerable variability among species. As a group, both species used for food and globally threatened species declined in abundance during that period in CNP. The abundance of all groups of species declined from 1992 to 1994, coinciding with a reduction in hunting vigilance at CNP. Evidence suggests that the main factor differentiating the abundance of mammals in the two protected areas, and at CNP during the study period, was toe level of hunting. Golfo Dulce Forest Reserve seems to be achieving only partial success in protecting wildlife, whereas Corcovado National Park seems to be considerably more effective, although not entirely successful."
238,4147,Incorporating specific change points in catchability in fisheries stock assessment models: An alternative approach applied to the blue shark (Prionace glauca) stock in the south Atlantic Ocean,"Fishermen frequently switch their target fish species without documenting changes in which species they are targeting and the fishing practices used, generating misleading catchability information about the fish caught. To date, changes in target species have been incorporated in stock assessments at two different levels in analyses. First, these changes are taken into account during the parameterization of generalized linear models used to compute the CPUE index standardization. Second, changes in target species are directly incorporated as a time-varying catchability parameter during the fitting of the dynamic model used for the assessment. Here, we present an alternative method for this incorporation by specifying a single change point in the stationary distribution of the catchability coefficient in a Bayesian state-space production model. Two models were fitted to the time series of the south Atlantic blue shark (Prionace glauca) stock. In one of the models, only one catchability coefficient was estimated. In the other model, a change point was included, and two catchability coefficients were estimated, one before the change point, and the other after. Despite the latter model introducing an extra parameter, it produced a significantly better fit than the modeling approach without the change point. Although including a single change point in the catchability coefficient had no significant impact on the status of south Atlantic blue shark (which is still above BMSY), it provided a robust way of accounting for changes in catchability as a result of fishermen changing target species.

239,4146,Spatial predictions of blue shark (Prionace glauca) catch rate and catch probability of juveniles in the Southwest Atlantic,"Generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction was applied to catch per unit effort (cpue) data for blue shark (Prionace glauca) caught by the Brazilian tuna longline fleet between 1997 and 2008 (43 546 longline sets) to predict the effect of environmental, spatial, and temporal factors on catch distribution. In addition, the size distribution of blue sharks measured by on-board observers during the years 20062008 was used to model the proportion of juvenile blue sharks in the catches from a spatial perspective. Latitude was the most important factor influencing blue shark cpue in the Southwest Atlantic, with cpue spatial predictions suggesting two areas of higher catch probabilities. Latitude was also the most important factor influencing the proportion of juveniles in the catches. The spatial prediction map showed that juveniles were more frequently caught south of 35°S (?38°S). This information can assist in the design of management strategies either to exploit this predictable spatial distribution of the catch or to manage the fisheries in a spatially explicit manner if one component (i.e. juveniles) requires protective measures."
240,2151,"Monitoring changes in the catch rates and abundance of juvenile goliath grouper using the ENP creel survey, 1973-2006","In early 2006, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service removed goliath grouper from its list of species of concern. It cited a recent status report that showed a significant increase in the abundance of the USA population and suggested that goliath grouper are re-establishing themselves throughout their historic range. However, under the Magnuson-Stevens Conservation Act, the goliath grouper remains 'overfished,' and harvest is still illegal. The historical center of abundance of goliath grouper is the Ten Thousand Islands area of southwest Florida. Detailed catch and effort data are available from this region for 1973 to 2006. The data were collected by Everglades National Park (ENP) officials during voluntary dockside interviews of sport fishermen. Using this data, a standardized index of abundance was created for juvenile goliath grouper. The index shows a substantial decline in abundance during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since that time, the abundance of juveniles within ENP has increased considerably, suggesting that strong year classes have recently occurred in ENP. This information is useful for managers and stock assessment biologists tasked to evaluate the stock status of goliath grouper, and to determine acceptable harvest levels for scientific research and/or fishing.

241,4320,"Introduction of exotic fish species and decline of native species in the lower Po basin, north-eastern Italy","Freshwater ecosystems worldwide are experiencing native fish losses with severe threats to the conservation of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and the debate on whether the cause is biotic or abiotic disturbance is still open.Temporal variation in fish assemblages was analysed over an 18year period in 14 waterways of the lowland backwaters of the Po River in north-eastern Italy, which are important feeding, spawning and nursery sites for native fish.In 1991, 14 native and eight exotic species were collected. In less than 20years 10 native species underwent local extinction, three of which - Rutilus pigus, Rutilus aula, and Chondrostoma soetta - were endemic to the Padano-Veneto District in northern Italy.Ordination of the data (MDS, CLUSTER, ANOSIM, SIMPER) showed a clear temporal gradient in fish community structure. After the establishment of the exotic predator Silurus glanis, some native species significantly declined in abundance and biomass (i.e. Alburnus arborella and Scardinius erythrophthalmus) or disappeared (i.e. Rutilus aula and Tinca tinca). Moreover, exotic species Cyprinus carpio, Ameiurus melas, and Carassius auratus from previous introductions, underwent significant changes in their abundance and biomass. No correlation was found between fish community structure and water quality parameters (BIOENV).The success of exotic species, particularly S. glanis which thrived in this degraded habitat, seems to have led to the decline of native fish fauna in the canals of the lower portion of the Po River basin. Conservation strategies focusing on the containment of exotic species and habitat restoration are recommended. "
242,3531,"Status, ecology and conservation of sea turtles in Guinea-Bissau","This paper provides the first overview of sea turtles in Guinea-Bissau, presents data on their ecology, and analyzes threats and conservation initiatives. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is by far the most widespread and abundant of the 5 species that nest in Guinea-Bissau. Between ca. 7000 and 29,000 green turtle nests are laid per year at the globally important site of Poilão Island, with a few hundred more on surrounding islands. There is a marked interspecific variability in nesting seasonality, with green and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles nesting mostly during the rainy season and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) and leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) during the dry season. Informal interviews all over the coastal zone suggest that sea turtle populations have markedly declined within living memory. Main threats are poaching of eggs and of nesting females and the incidental capture in fishing gear. Amongst the major achievements of sea turtle conservation efforts are that all species are protected by law, the most important nesting beaches have been included in the protected area network, and significant progress has been made in removing the presence of settlements of foreign fishermen from the areas near the turtle concentrations where accidental captures used to occur. On the down side, it should be pointed out that protection in the national parks is insufficient. The main problem seems to be the weak enforcement of park and national rules by park authorities, which creates a feeling of relative impunity in park residents and visiting fishermen. "
243,4328,Are salinas a suitable alternative breeding habitat for Little Terns Sterna albifrons?,"This paper describes the breeding population, breeding habitats and reproductive variables of Little Terns Sterna albifrons in natural (sandy beaches) and alternative (salinas) habitats. Studies of nesting success conducted between 1998 and 2002 in these two types of habitat were combined with a literature review of census work from the past 30 years in order to assess whether salinas are suitable alternative breeding habitat for Little Terns. Most of the Portuguese Little Tern population now breeds in salinas. Census data from the last 30 years show that this is a recent breeding behaviour, because until the 1990s most colonies were located on sandy beaches. Destruction and disturbance of the natural habitat has caused this habitat shift. Despite this shift, the Portuguese Little Tern breeding population did not decline during this period and no significant differences were found in nesting success between natural and alternative habitats. This might indicate that salinas are a suitable alternative breeding habitat for Little Terns, but differences in laying period, clutch size and egg size were recorded between birds nesting on sandy beaches and in salinas in the same area. Birds nested earlier on sandy beaches and laid larger clutches and eggs than in salinas. These data suggest that, when both habitats are available, older and/or higher quality birds prefer sandy beaches for breeding, presumably trying to re-nest in salinas when first breeding attempts failed. We discuss conservation priorities and management actions for both habitats."
244,4333,The status of an isolated population of Goosander Mergus merganser in the Balkans,"This paper describes in detail for the first time the small, isolated population of Goosander Mergus merganser at the transboundary Prespa Lakes and Lake Ohrid in the Balkans. Co-ordinated censuses made during the breeding season each year from 2011-2015 inclusive estimated that there are 15-25 breeding pairs (15-34 according to the number of drakes counted) involving at least 77 individuals at Prespa Lakes, although numbers vary between years. The maximum number of young reared per pair in May-June 2011-2015 was estimated at 6.4 ± 3.5 (mean ± s.d., n = 35). During the period 1988-2013 the Prespa Lakes have also been the most important wintering site for this population, holding 4.8-100% (mean ± s.d.= 46.5 ± 29.5% ; n = 21) of the total numbers of Goosanders wintering in the southwest Balkans (i.e. in Albania, the FYR of Macedonia and Greece). Up to 130 birds overwinter in the region, where numbers have increased during the last 30 years, including at Prespa and Ohrid Lakes. The 2014 census provided first evidence of 3-4 pairs of Goosander nesting at Lake Ohrid, the second most important wintering site in the region. Conservation of this isolated population is of utmost importance, at least in a European context."
245,881,Management of the Vicuna Vicugna-Vicugna in Chile - Use of a Matrix Model to Assess Harvest Rates,"Some aspects of the population dynamics of the vicuña Vicugna vicugna were studied using census and field data recorded at the Reserva Nacional Las Vicuñas, I Region, northernmost Chile. Census data and mean values of fertility and survival were used to estimate functional classes for growth rate and population trends. The Chilean population of the vicuña is growing at an annual rate of 16·4% and the curve fits an exponential model. Using these data a harvest process was simulated with a Leslie matrix population model (Pielou, E.C. (1974). Population and Community Ecology: Principles and Methods. Gordon & Breach, New York). Fertility and survival for each age-functional class were adjusted according to a compensatory mechanism when fixed harvest rates (10, 12·5 and 15%) were applied for a 20-year period. Harvesting three 'adult' classes at 12·5% of the total population showed that the population level remains stable if it is placed at the half carrying capacity level. This rate yielded an average of 1680 specimens per year. A harvest rate of 15% resulted in a 3% annual decrease of the population size. The importance of fertility and survival estimates is discussed, bearing in mind the need to improve future management plans. "
246,2327,"Abundance and distribution of elephants in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia","Elephant density over 40 000 km2 of the Luangwa Valley was estimated as 2–17 km‐2 to give a population size of around 86 000 in that area, a tally that would probably top 100 000 if unsurveyed areas within the drainage had been included. Seasonal movement is largely restricted to a migration on to the riverine strip during the wet season and reciprocal dispersal across the valley thereafter. The mean annual range of movement is about 25 km. "
247,4281,"Population abundance, natural history, and habitat use by the arboreal marsupial Dromiciops gliroides in rural Chiloe´ Island, Chile","Populations of the endemic and threatened marsupial Dromiciops gliroides were studied in logged and; unlogged forest patches and shrublands in a rural area of northern Chiloe´ Island (42uS), Chile. We expected to find differences in abundance, with higher densities in unlogged, old-growth remnant forests. Individuals were livetrapped over 4 years (20052009) at the peak of their breeding (November) and nonbreeding (February) seasons. We estimated population densities using capturemarkrecapture procedures. Home range, diet (through fecal content), and health status (ectoparasite loads) were assessed for captured individuals. We estimated the length of the breeding season by the levels of reproductive hormones, whereas winter torpor was documented using artificial nest boxes. Population densities varied seasonally in accordance with breeding, with higher densities recorded during summer, and were similar in old-growth and in logged forests, but were considerable higher in forests than in shrublands. D. gliroides reproduced well in both unlogged and logged forests. Social torpor was documented for the 1st time and was fairly frequent (64%), especially among juveniles. Home ranges were 2 times larger for males than for females. We confirmed the omnivorous diet of D. gliroides, with predominant consumption of arthropods, and a higher consumption of fleshy fruits during summer. Habitat and animal age had significant effects on ectoparasite prevalence, with higher incidences among juveniles in logged forests. We conclude that D. gliroides is not a rare species in remnant forests in the rural landscape of Chiloe´ Island. This result is crucial for the assessment of its conservation status and offers clues for designing better conservation strategies for this living fossil in anthropogenic landscapes."
248,1515,Movements of humpback whales between Kauai and Hawaii: implications for population structure and abundance estimation in the Hawaiian Islands.,"Identification photographs of individual humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae were used to investigate movements of whales between Kauai and Hawaii (approximately 500 km apart; the Hawaiian Islands, USA) during the winter and spring months of 1989, 1990 and 1991. A total of 1072 individuals were identified, with 40 individuals being sighted off both islands. There were 15 documented transits between islands within seasons; 9 whales traveled northwest (from Hawaii to Kauai), whereas 6 whales traveled southeast (Kauai to Hawaii). Simulation data indicated that these transit-direction proportions did not deviate from random expectations (p = 0.76); therefore, there was no directional trend to movement between the islands. The shortest observed transit was 8 d, indicating that whales can move throughout the island chain in short periods. Males were significantly overrepresented in inter-island recaptures (p << 0.001), and we suggest that males actively engaged in courtship behaviors are more wide-ranging. Whales did not show a significant trend to be captured off the same island in different years (p = 0.08 for Kauai, p = 0.12 for Hawaii); however, recaptures were few, power was relatively low, and 1 test approached significance. The observed number of within-season, between-island recaptures was significantly less than expected as determined by random simulations (p = 0.013 for Kauai, p = 0.008 for Hawaii), indicating that, during a season, whales are more likely to be recaptured off the island of initial capture. There was also evidence suggesting that sub-groups of whales moved among the islands in loose aggregations: within seasons, the number of pairs of individuals captured off both islands within 7 d of each other was significantly greater than expected in random simulations (p = 0.038). We conclude that complete random mixing of whales among the islands is unlikely, and should not be assumed in the context of mark-recapture abundance estimation. Larger samples with greater coverage of the Hawaiian Islands and higher recapture probability will be needed to elucidate movement patterns of the population."
249,2805,Encouraging outlook for recovery of a once severely exploited megaherbivore,"Aim To critically review the status of the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) using the best available scientific studies as there is a prevailing view that this species is globally endangered and its marine ecosystem functions compromised. Location Ogasawara (Japan), Hawaii (USA), Great Barrier Reef (Australia), Florida (USA), Tortuguero (Costa Rica). Methods We compiled seasonal nesting activity data from all reliable continuous long-term studies (> 25 years), which comprised data series for six of the world's major green turtle rookeries. We estimated the underlying time-specific trend in these six rookery-specific nester or nest abundance series using a generalized smoothing spline regression approach. Results Estimated rates of nesting population increase ranged from c. 4-14% per annum over the past two to three decades. These rates varied considerably among the rookeries, reflecting the level of historical exploitation. Similar increases in nesting population were also evident for many other green turtle stocks that have been monitored for shorter durations than the long-term studies presented here. Main conclusions We show that six of the major green turtle nesting populations in the world have been increasing over the past two to three decades following protection from human hazards such as exploitation of eggs and turtles. This population recovery or rebound capacity is encouraging and suggests that the green turtle is not on the brink of global extinction even though some stocks have been seriously depleted and are still below historical abundance levels. This demonstrates that relatively simple conservation strategies can have a profound effect on the recovery of once-depleted green turtle stocks and presumably the restoration of their ecological function as major marine consumers."
250,1126,Trends in the abundance of sea turtles resident in southern Great Barrier Reef waters.,"A mark-recapture study was used to estimate trends in annual abundance of green and loggerhead turtles resident in southern Great Barrier Reef (sGBR) waters between 1985-1992. Abundance was derived using a Horvitz-Thompson type estimator based on sex- and ageclass-specific recapture probabilities conditioned on annual sampling effort. The resident green turtle population increased over the 8 years by 11% pa and comprised 1300 individuals in 1992. The female nesting population also increased but more slowly at 3% pa and has continued to do so. The increase may be due to favourable environmental conditions affecting breeding behaviour. On the other hand, the resident loggerhead population declined at 3% pa and comprised < 40 adults by 1992. The female loggerhead nesting population also declined over the same period at 8% pa and has continued to do so. Yet loggerhead survival was high and constant so the decline may be due to recruitment failures resulting from (1) fox predation of eggs at mainland rookeries during the 1960s and (2) pelagic juvenile mortality from incidental capture in longline fisheries since the 1970s. The sGBR loggerhead stock is clearly endangered. "
251,3485,Environmental extremes versus ecological extremes: impact of a massive iceberg on the population dynamics of a high-level Antarctic marine predator,"Extreme events have been suggested to play a disproportionate role in shaping ecological processes, but our understanding of the types of environmental conditions that elicit extreme consequences in natural ecosystems is limited. Here, we investigated the impact of a massive iceberg on the dynamics of a population of Weddell seals. Reproductive rates of females were reduced, but survival appeared unaffected. We also found suggestive evidence for a prolonged shift towards higher variability in reproductive rates. The annual number of females attending colonies showed unusual swings during the iceberg period, a pattern that was apparently the consequence of changes in sea-ice conditions. In contrast to the dramatic effects that were recorded in nearby populations of emperor penguins, our results suggest that this unusual environmental event did not have an extreme impact on the population of seals in the short-term, as they managed to avoid survival costs and were able to rapidly re-achieve high levels of reproduction by the end of the perturbation. Nevertheless, population projections suggest that even this modest impact on reproductive rates could negatively affect the population in the long run if such events were to occur more frequently, as is predicted by models of climate change.

252,2023,"Decline of the leatherback population in Terengganu, Malaysia, 1956-1995","The Rantau Abang leatherback population in Terengganu, Malaysia is now severely depleted, with current nestings representing less than 1% of levels recorded in the 1950s. Major causes of decline are mortalities attributed to fisheries operations in the high seas as well as within the territorial waters of Malaysia, and a long history of egg exploitation. These problems have been compounded by loss of suitable nesting habitat due to tourism-related development, marine pollution, and sub-optimal hatchery practices leading to reduced hatch rates and sex-biased hatchling production. The global moratorium on driftnet fisheries and complete protection of eggs to ensure optimal hatch rates and production of hatchlings with balanced sex ratios offer some hope for the eventual rehabilitation of the depleted population."
253,2423,Habitat quality and habitat selection of golden-winged warblers in Costa Rica: an application of hierarchical models for open populations,"Identifying high-quality habitat is integral to effective species conservation efforts and requires information about habitat-specific abundance and demographics. This information is lacking for many species of conservation concern because of the inherent difficulties associated with implementing mark-recapture studies at large spatial scales. The golden-winged warbler Vermivora chrysoptera is a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird experiencing a long-term population decline; yet no information about non-breeding season habitat quality or habitat selection exists to inform conservation efforts. We used a novel hierarchical model that requires only spatially and temporally replicated count data to estimate habitat-specific abundance, apparent survival, recruitment and detection probability of golden-winged warblers wintering in Costa Rica. We quantified habitat selection at the home-range level using radiotelemetry. Golden-winged warblers were absent from tropical dry forest and were most abundant in premontane evergreen forest. Within their home ranges, golden-winged warblers selected microhabitat features associated with intermediate disturbance that reflected their preference for foraging in hanging dead leaves. Consistent with other evidence of a declining population, local population size decreased over the duration of the study. The rate of decrease was higher during the non-breeding season than among seasons. We found no differences in apparent survival or recruitment among habitat types; however, our estimates of these parameters were imprecise. Synthesis and applications. Golden-winged warblers are forest-dependent species during the non-breeding season and have specialized microhabitat requirements that make them vulnerable to ongoing tropical deforestation. However, advanced secondary forests can provide the requisite microhabitat features, and because we found no evidence of reduced survival in this habitat type, regenerating forest on degraded lands may be an effective component of a conservation strategy for this species. Our study also demonstrates that information on population dynamics and habitat quality can be obtained using repeated counts instead of mark-recapture methods. "
254,1489,"Long-Term Effects of Logging on African Primate Communities: a 28-Year Comparison From Kibale National Park, Uganda","If logging is to be compatible with primate conservation, primate populations must be expected to recover from the disturbance and eventually return to their former densities. Surveys conducted over 28 years were used to quantify the long-term effects of both low- and high-intensity selective logging on the density of the five common primates in Kibale National Park, Uganda. The most dramatic exception to the expectation that primate populations will recover following logging was that group densities of Cercopithecus mitis and C. ascanius in the heavily logged area continued to decline decades after logging. Procolobus tephrosceles populations were recovering in the heavily logged areas, but the rate of increase appeared to be slow (0.005 groups/km2 per year). Colobus guereza appeared to do well in some disturbed habitats and were found at higher group densities in the logged areas than in the unlogged area. There was no evidence of an increase in Lophocebus albigena group density in the heavily logged area since the time of logging, and there was a tendency for its population to be lower in heavily logged areas than in lightly logged areas. In contrast to the findings from the heavily logged area, none of the species were found at a lower group density in the lightly logged area than in the unlogged area, and group densities in this area were not changing at a statistically significant rate. The results of our study suggest that, in this region, low-intensity selective logging could be one component of conservation plans for primates; high-intensity logging, however, which is typical of most logging operations throughout Africa, is incompatible with primate conservation."
255,2110,Population declines of colobus in Western Uganda and conservation value of forest fragments,"The processes of habitat loss and fragmentation are probably the most important threats to biodiversity. It is critical that we understand the conservation value of fragments, because they may represent opportunities to make important conservation gains, particularly for species whose ranges are not in a protected area. However, our ability to understand the value of fragments for Primates is limited by the fact that researchers have conducted many studies in protected areas, which do not represent most fragments, and studies are typically short term. Here we determine the long-term survival probability of red (Procolobus pennantii) and black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) inhabiting forest fragments outside of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Local communities use the fragments primarily for subsistence agriculture and fuelwood. We surveyed primate populations 3 times over 8 yr, made a total inventory of all trees 2 times, contrasted behavior of groups inhabiting 1 fragment with groups in the continuous forest, and judged the conservation value of the fragments by quantifying patterns of forest use by local people. Of the 20 fragments surveyed, 16 supported resident populations of colobus in 1995, 2 were cleared in 2000, and an additional 2 fragments were cleared by 2003. In 1995 we counted 165 black-and-white colobus, whereas in 2000 and 2003, we counted 119 and 75 individuals, respectively. Seven fragments supported red colobus in 1995, 11 in 2000, and 9 in 2003. In 2000 we counted 159 red colobus, while in 2003, we saw 145 individuals. For both species, activity patterns in continuous forest were similar to those in a fragment, with the exception that individuals in the fragment rested more. Colobus in the fragment ate more mature leaves than colobus in the continuous forest did. Fragments supported all the fuelwood needs of an average of 32 people who lived immediately adjacent to them, and partially supported families up to 3 farms away (ca. 400 m), representing 576 people. Intensive harvesting for fuelwood occurred when neighboring households engaged in beer brewing (an average of 9.6% of the households), gin distilling (8.8%), or charcoal production (14.5%). Overall, between 2000 and 2003, the average density of trees declined by 14 trees/ha (range 0-60 trees/ha). If current rates of clearing continue, the probability that the fragments will continue to support colobus populations is low."
256,3964,"Fish faunal resurgence in Lake Nabugabo, East Africa","In Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, a small satellite of the equatorial Lake Victoria, approximately 50% of the; indigenous fish species disappeared from the open waters subsequent to establishment of the introduced predatory Nile perch (Lates niloticus). However, several of these species persisted in wetland refugia. Over the past decade, Nile perch in Lake Nabugabo have been intensively fished. Herein we report a resurgence of some indigenous species in open waters. In a multiyear study, we used annual transects in inshore and offshore waters of exposed (no wetland) and wetland habitats to document the pattern of resurgence. In 1995, haplochromine cichlids were largely confined to inshore areas, particularly wetland ecotones, and were rare in Nile perch stomachs, as were most other indigenous species. By 2000 haplochromine cichlids were abundant in inshore and offshore areas of both exposed and wetland transects. Several indigenous noncichlids also reappeared in the main lake, including three of the four original mormyrid species. Between 1995 and 1999, there was a dramatic increase in the proportion of haplochromines in the diet of Nile perch. When haplochromines were rare (1995), Nile perch switched from an invertebrate-dominated diet to piscivory at a large size (30 cm total length). In 2000, however, Nile perch were strongly piscivorous by 510 cm total length. The pattern of faunal loss and recovery in Lake Nabugabo demonstrates the importance of refugia in providing the seeds of resurgence and provides a model with which to understand some changes in Lake Victoria."
257,4247,Inter-annual dynamics and persistence of small mammal communities in a selectively logged tropical forest in Borneo,"Understanding temporal change and long-term persistence of species and communities is vital if we are to accurately assess the relative values of human-modified habitats for biodiversity. Despite a large literature and emerging consensus demonstrating a high conservation value of selectively logged tropical rainforests, few studies have taken a long-term perspective. We resampled small mammals (≤ 1 kg) in a heavily logged landscape in Sabah, Borneo between 2011 and 2016 to investigate temporal patterns of species-level changes in population density. We found that small mammal population density in heavily logged forest was highly variable among years, consistent with patterns previously observed in unlogged forest, and uncovered evidence suggesting that one species is potentially declining towards local extinction. Across nine species, population densities varied almost sevenfold during our 6-year study period, highlighting the extremely dynamic nature of small mammal communities in this ecosystem. Strictly terrestrial murid species tended to exhibit strong temporal dynamics, whereas semi-arboreal foraging species such as treeshrews had more stable dynamics. We found no relationships between population density and fruit/seed mass, and therefore no evidence that our patterns represent responses to inter-annual mast fruiting of the dominant canopy dipterocarp trees. This may be due to the removal of most of the canopy during logging, and hence the dipterocarp seed resource, although it possibly also reflects spatiotemporal limitations of our data. Our results underline the importance of understanding long-term variability in animal communities before developing conservation and management recommendations for human-altered ecosystems."
258,2535,Acoustic detections of singing humpback whales in deep waters off the British Isles,"From October 1996 through September 1998, we used bottom-mounted hydrophone arrays to monitor deep-water areas north and west of the British Isles for songs of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Singing humpbacks were consistently detected between October and March from the Shetland-Faroe Islands south to waters west of the English Channel. Temporal and geographic patterns of song detections, and movements of individually tracked whales, exhibited a southwesterly trend over this period, but with no corresponding northward trend between April and September. These results, together with a review of historical data from this area, suggest that the offshore waters of the British Isles represent a migration corridor for humpbacks, at least some of which summer in Norwegian (and possibly eastern Icelandic) waters. The migratory destination of the detected animals remains unknown, but the limited data suggest that these whales are bound primarily for the West Indies rather than historical breeding areas off the northwestern coast of Africa. Humpbacks detected in British waters after early to mid-March probably do not undertake a full migration to the tropics. These data provide further evidence that singing is not confined to tropical waters in winter, but occurs commonly on migration even in high latitudes."
259,3504,"Responses of coral and fish assemblages to a severe but short-lived tropical cyclone on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia","Changes in reef assemblages of corals and fishes following a tropical cyclone were assessed using data sets from (1) manta tow surveys of entire reef perimeters and (2) intensive surveys of specific sites, across 11 reefs lying close to the cyclone's track. Only one of the reefs experienced an obvious and immediate decline in mean coral cover (from 24 to 8%) due to the cyclone. The abundance and species richness of adult damselfish assemblages on intensive survey sites at this reef were not affected in the short term (6-8 weeks), despite the removal of 48% of living hard coral. Assemblages of adult fishes showed a similar lack of response at three other reefs where no significant habitat changes had occurred. Eleven to twelve months later, the total abundance of damselfishes had decreased substantially at eight of the sampled reefs, while the abundance of larger mobile fishes remained stable. We infer that the effects on coral assemblages reflect the short duration and orientation of the cyclone, the history of exposure to wave energy (influencing life-form structure and therefore degree of fragility), and the degree of consolidation of the reef matrix. The lack of short-term effects of the cyclone on adult fishes shows that these fishes can endure periods of intense underwater turbulence. The lack of change in damselfish assemblages weeks after loss of coral cover implies that this resource was not limiting adult fish densities. The reasons for widespread decreases in damselfish numbers 11-12 months after the cyclone are unknown."
260,4544,Time series dataset of fish assemblages near thermal discharges at nuclear power plants in northern Taiwan,"Long-term time series datasets with consistent sampling methods are rather rare, especially the ones of non-target coastal fishes. Here we described a long-term time series dataset of fish collected by trammel net fish sampling and observed by an underwater diving visual census near the thermal discharges at two nuclear power plants on the northern coast of Taiwan. Both experimental and control stations of these two investigations were monitored four times per year in the surrounding seas at both plants from 2000 to 2017. The underwater visual census mainly monitored reef fish assemblages and trammel net samples monitored pelagic or demersal fishes above the muddy/sandy bottom. In total, 508 samples containing 203,863 individuals from 347 taxa were recorded in both investigations at both plants. These data can be used by ecologists and fishery biologists interested in the elucidation of the temporal patterns of species abundance and composition."
261,1909,Comparison of the genetics and nesting ecology of two green turtle rookeries,"We characterize the behavioral, phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the two main green turtle Chelonia mydas nesting populations remaining in Taiwan and examine how the differing ecology of the nesting environments on each island may have influenced these life-history traits. Wan-an Island in the south-west sector of the Taiwan Straits was found to be hotter and drier than Lanyu Island located south-east of Taiwan in the Pacific Ocean. The frequency of nesting attempts and the internesting intervals were both significantly greater (mean nesting attempts: 15.4 vs. 15.2, mean internesting interval: 13.7 vs. 10.6 days) for the Wan-an nesters. Nests were deeper (69.6 vs. 69.0 cm) while the incubation duration was shorter on this island (52.1 vs. 54.7 days). Green turtles were larger on Lanyu, but deposited smaller eggs. Nests on Lanyu had higher hatching success, hatchling emergence success and clutch survival rate (hatching success; 72.2 vs. 80.76%, hatchling emergence success; 47 vs. 64.1%, clutch survival rate; 67.7 vs. 70.3%). However, hatchlings on Wan-an were larger (HC; 47.6 vs. 46.6 cm. HW; 23.9 vs. 21.7 cm). Analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences obtained from a total of 53 nesters indicated that both rookeries are genetically distinct (FST=0.673, P<0.00001), with a single haplotype characterizing the Lanyu rookery (n=13). This lack of gene flow between the two rookeries is evidence for localized natal homing and is consistent with the morphological and behavioral differences that we detected between the two rookeries. These findings are surprising given the close geographic proximity of the two rookeries"
262,4346,"The Black-necked Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis): an expanding species in the Middle Atlas wetlands, Morocco","The present study investigates the population trends of Black-necked Grebe Podiceps nigricollis (Podicipedidae: Podicidae) over 5 years (2009-2013) in three Middle Atlas wetlands (Aguelmam Afennourir, Dayet Aoua and Dayet Ifrah). Using generalized linear models with a Poisson distribution, we demonstrated that the number of Black-necked Grebe breeding pairs has varied significantly and positively over the 5 years and between the three study wetlands. The annual population growth rate of the three colonies was 0.48 (±0.01). This positive trend is consistent with the current Least Concern conservation status of the IUCN Red List. Further more detailed studies are, however, needed to improve our understanding on the mechanisms driving the population increase in this part of North Africa. This remains a prerequisite for proper population conservation and management. "
263,1771,Evaluating the status of exploited taxa in the northern South China Sea using intrinsic vulnerability and spatially explicit catch-per-unit-effort data,"This paper compares the exploitation status of 17 species groups of fish in the northern South China Sea (NSCS) using spatially explicit catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data of demersal trawlers from 1973 to 1988, with a 'rapid appraisal' technique using intrinsic vulnerability. We attempt to minimize biases from the non-randomness of the catch and effort survey by interpolating CPUE, spatially and temporally, in un-sampled areas. The data are then standardized with a generalized linear model to obtain the time-series changes in relative catch rate during this period. Using multiple imputation analysis, we account for the uncertainty associated with the interpolated data. The CPUE of most of these species declined by over 70% over the 15-year period. CPUE of some intrinsically vulnerable groups such as skates and rays declined by an average of over 90%. Based on their life history traits reported in published literature and FishBase, we calculate an index of intrinsic vulnerability from a published expert system for the 17 species groups and evaluate its relationship with the estimated declines in catch rate. The results support the hypothesis that the two variables are positively related (i.e., species with higher intrinsic vulnerability would have a stronger rate of decline). Thus, intrinsic vulnerability can be used to approximate the population status of other species in the region that are exploited by bottom trawlers. "
264,4107,"Population mapping of gibbons in Kalimantan, Indonesia: correlates of gibbon density and vegetation across the species' range",": The first comprehensive survey of gibbons (<i>Hylobates</i> spp.) across Indonesian Borneo was carried out over 3 years to (1) determine whether densities of gibbon species are correlated with vegetation characteristics, and if so, whether the same characteristics are correlated with density across all forest types; and (2) determine population densities in the survey areas and identify threats to the areas. To achieve this, a total of 8 forest blocks were surveyed, involving 53 independent survey locations and repeat surveys in 3 forest blocks. Our data show that gibbons are ubiquitous where there is forest; however, the quality of forest affects population density, forest block size affects longevity of populations, and populations are susceptible to the compression effect, i.e. populations occupy smaller fragments at unsustainably high densities. We show the effects of forest disturbance (logging, fire, fragmentation) on gibbon distribution and density and highlight issues for long-term conservation. We discuss the use of minimum cross-sectional area, habitat variables and presence of top foods to determine population density and to identify a threshold below which gibbons cannot persist. We discuss the conservation issues facing all Bornean gibbons, including natural hybrids (<i>H. muelleri</i> × <i>H. albibarbis</i>). The answers to these research questions will help mitigate threats to gibbons and their habitat, as well as identify key habitat for gibbon populations within and outside the protected area network."
265,3043,Intrapopulation variation in life history traits of Boa constrictor occidentalis in Argentina,"We provide data on intrapopulation variation of life history traits of Boa constrictor occidentalis in the; District of Pocho, Córdoba, Argentina. A total of 153 individuals were captured. The distribution of individuals; among four size classes differed signi cantly among the  ve years of study. The proportion of mature individuals; did not differ between sexes but it showed variation among years. Females were longer and heavier than males.; The mean litter size of the species was 24 and there was a linear relationship between litter size and maternal; snout-vent length. Most boas were captured during the dry season. There were no signi cant sex differences; in the time of capture and air temperature in either the wet or the dry seasons. However, we found signi cant; differences in the time of capture and air temperature between the seasons. The long-term monitoring of wild; populations should be a priority for the development of conservation and management plans for this boid."
266,4486,"Sexual Dimorphism, habitat use and seasonal abundance of Elachistocleis cf. ovalis (Anura: Microhylidae) in a Cerrado remnant of São Paulo state, southeastern Brazil","Elachistocleis ovalis is a species presenting taxonomical problems and wide distribution throughout South America. We provide information on sexual dimorphism, calling site, habitat use and seasonal abundance of; E. cf. ovalis in a preserved Cerrado area in São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil. Sampling was carried out primarily with pitfall traps. Traps were placed in areas characterized by three different physiognomies: campo sujo, campo cerrado, and gallery forest edge. We found sexual dimorphism, with females being larger than males. Similar dimorphism has already been documented for other populations and congeneric species. The calling site of males was also in agreement with the literature on other populations and species. Habitat use was different among the three environments, with higher abundance in gallery forest edges. This population showed a clear pattern of seasonal activity, in which abundance was higher during rainy seasons, as well as other Cerrrado anuran species. Abundance was related to relative air humidity and maximum temperature, two variables whose influence on anurans has already been documented. We found no variation in the abundance patterns of the population between the two years in which samples were carried out."
267,3452,Spatial scale and abundance patterns of large fish communities in freshwater marshes of the Florida Everglades,"Anthropogenic habitat alterations and water-management practices have imposed an artificial spatial scale onto the once contiguous freshwater marshes of the Florida Everglades. To gain insight into how these changes may affect biotic communities, we examined whether variation in the abundance and community structure of large fishes (SL > 8 cm) in Everglades marshes varied more at regional or intra-regional scales, and whether this variation was related to hydroperiod, water depth, floating mat volume, and vegetation density. From October 1997 to October 2002, we used an airboat electrofisher to sample large fishes at sites within three regions of the Everglades. Each of these regions is subject to unique water-management schedules. Dry-down events (water depth < 10 cm) occurred at several sites during spring in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002. The 2001 dry-down event was the most severe and widespread. Abundance of several fishes decreased significantly through time, and the number of days post-dry-down covaried significantly with abundance for several species. Processes operating at the regional scale appear to play important roles in regulating large fishes. The most pronounced patterns in abundance and community structure occurred at the regional scale, and the effect size for region was greater than the effect size for sites nested within region for abundance of all species combined, all predators combined, and each of the seven most abundant species. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling revealed distinct groupings of sites corresponding to the three regions. We also found significant variation in community structure through time that correlated with the number of days post-dry-down. Our results suggest that hydroperiod and water management at the regional scale influence large fish communities of Everglades marshes. "
268,3495,"Using life-history traits of New Zealand sea lions, Auckland Islands to clarify potential causes of decline","Annual censuses of New Zealand (NZ) sea lions Phocarctos hookeri at the subantarctic Auckland Islands have indicated a decline in pup production of over 40% during the first decade of the 2000s. With this significant decline and likely decline in the population as a whole, population ecology theory hypothesizes that life-history traits such as reproduction rate, survival or growth should improve, particularly if density-dependency is playing a significant role in the population. This research examined whether changes in NZ sea lion pup production were associated with changes in adult abundance or population life-history traits in an attempt to clarify potential causes of decline. Since 1998/1999, daily surveys of Sandy Bay, Enderby Island, were undertaken during the NZ sea lion breeding season (December-February). These surveys confirm that the number of adults at the breeding area has significantly declined during the period of pup production decline. There was no difference between years in mean pup birth date, but the ratio of pups to females ashore during peak pupping varied significantly. The sex ratio of pups at birth also varied from year to year, but with no significant variation overall. Pup mortality varied significantly only during years of epizootic events (1997/1998, 2001/2002 and 2002/2003). Pup birth mass showed little variation between 2000/2001 and 2006/2007, increasing slightly in the last 3 years of study. Pup mass at 3 weeks, although highly variable, showed no trend during the period of decline. Despite the significant decrease in pup production and breeding animals, not all life-history traits relating to pup mass and survival or female fecundity improved. Research suggests that indirect fishing-related pressures may influence some of these traits and that the NZ sea lion population was unlikely to have been influenced by density-dependent factors or to have been at or near carrying capacity before the decline.

269,3501,Population structure and residency patterns of the blacktip reef shark Carcharhinus melanopterus in turbid coastal environments,"This study examined the characteristics of a blacktip reef shark Carcharhinus melanopterus population in turbid coastal habitats through a multi-year fishery-independent sampling and tag-recapture programme. Results revealed a highly structured population comprised almost entirely of juveniles and adult females with individuals between 850 and 1050mm total length effectively absent. Mature males were also rarely encountered with adult sex ratio highly biased towards females (female:male=7:1). Mating scars were observed on adult females between December and April, and parturition was observed from December to March. Regression analysis showed that catch rates were significantly higher during the summer wet season between November and May. Recapture data suggested a highly resident population with a recapture rate of 21% and a mean recapture distance of 0·8km. In addition, 33% of recaptured animals were captured multiple times, indicating long-term residency. Most recaptures were, however, of adults with few juveniles recaptured. Widespread sampling at the study site and in adjacent areas suggested that the population was highly localized to a specific bay. The bimodal and sex-segregated population structure observed here differs from previous reports for this species, and in combination with reproductive observations, suggests population structuring to facilitate reproductive and recruitment success. These data also highlight the potential ecosystem functions performed by coastal habitats in sustaining C. melanopterus populations. "
270,3051,Has the Luangwa (Zambia) hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) population stabilized after reaching its asymptote? What are the management challenges?,"The population size of hippo (Hippopotamus am- phibius Linnaeus 1758) in Luangwa valley, Zam- bia was earlier assessed for the period 1976- 2008 and repeated 2009-2012 and found to have reached and maintained carrying capacity K of 6000 individuals over a 165 km river stretch. This study covered the period 2009-2012 and used river bank count method as in previous studies. The method involved counting indivi- duals and taking GPS locations of hippo schools. During the period 2009-2012 the population had maintained irregular cycles oscillating above and below K of 6000 and was still within carrying capacity band of 2000 individuals. The highest population size was still 6832 hippos (rounded off to 7000) and density of 42/km reached in 1984, and the lowest was 4765 hippos (rounded off to 5000) and density of 29/km recorded in 1978. Be- tween 1976-2008, and 2009-2012 the population still oscillated between 5000 - 7000 individuals, which is symptomatic of a population that had reached its asymptote. Plot of population size for the period 1976-2012 assumed a population model which was a hybrid between less accu-rate regulation and stable limit cycle. The slow-down in population growth at K and oscillations were attributed to environmental resistance. More studies are required to identify the impact of climate change on the population size and den-sity fluctuations to determine whether K will rise or drop."
271,3937,Decadal changes in urban bird abundance in Singapore,"Birds are one of the most cost-effective groups to survey for monitoring human impacts; on faunal communities and are consequently the best studied taxonomic group in urban areas. Urban bird; assemblages are typically dominated by a few pest species, and need to be appropriately managed to reduce; the aesthetic costs and health risks they may pose in highly-populated areas. Studies were conducted in; Singapore (Feb.2000 to Feb.2001) to provide recommendations to manage urban birds, in particular to control; the population of two invasive alien bird species: the house crow (Corvus splendens) and the Javan myna; (Acridotheres javanicus). We then re-surveyed the same sites 9 years later (Mar.2010 to Feb.2011) to compare; the changes in the abundance of the 20 most common urban bird species in Singapore over the past decade.; We also tested whether the decrease in house crow abundance was correlated with increases in abundance; of its co-invasive, the Javan myna, or with the Asian koel (Eudynamys scolopacea), a brood parasite of the; house crow, across sites. In addition, we investigated competition between two myna species by comparing; whether declines in the abundance of the common myna (Acridotheres trista) were correlated with increases; in the abundance of the Javan myna. Our results showed that a total of 14 species recorded a signifi cant; increase in abundance between the two surveys, two species signifi cantly decreased, and four species had; no signifi cant change. There was also no signifi cant correlation between all the bird abundances, although; changes in bird abundances were signifi cantly associated with certain changes in the urban environment; such as spontaneous or cultivated green cover. We suggest that reduced density of house crow nests may; actually result in increased vulnerability to, and hence success rate of, brood parasitism by the Asian koel,; or there may be increased parasitism of other host species nests. Meanwhile, competitive effects among; the other birds may not be detectable at the scale of the transects used in our study."

273,1376,"Conservation and biomonitoring in the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, Bihar, India","From March 2001 to December 2003 eight direct count surveys in an upstream direction were conducted for Ganges river dolphins Platanista gangetica gangetica in the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, a c. 60 km long segment of the middle Ganges River in Bihar, India. The mean number of dolphins recorded during upstream surveys was 119.4±SD 31.8 (range 88-174), with an encounter rate of 1.8 dolphins km-1 (range 1.4-2.8). During these surveys a rich diversity of other threatened aquatic wildlife was also documented, including the Indian smooth-coated otter Lutrogale perspicillata, gharial Gavialis gangeticus, a variety of freshwater turtles, and 135 water bird species. An assessment of fisheries documented 76 fish species of which 43% were caught exclusively in monofilament gill nets, a gear known to kill dolphins by entanglement. Eight new records of fishes preyed upon by Ganges river dolphins were identified from the stomach contents of two dolphin carcasses (Setipinna brevifilis, Osteobrama cotio cotio, Puntius sophore, Crosochelius latius, Mystus cavasius, Heteropneustus fossilis, Macrognathus pancalus, Sperata seenghala). These fishes and other species previously recorded in the diet of the dolphins composed 33.3% of the total catch sampled in 2001-2003. Interviews of 108 fishing households revealed that literacy rates were low (29.9%) and almost 50% earned less than USD 411 per year. The most important conservation actions that could be taken are for national and state governments to establish civil control and promote the development of community-based fishing cooperatives. These cooperatives could enjoy ownership rights to certain river segments in exchange for employing sustainable fishing techniques that are less injurious to dolphins. "
274,4035,Long-term changes in pronghorn abundance index linked to climate and oil development in North Dakota,"The interacting effects of climate change and habitat fragmentation on wildlife are of global conservation concern. Over the past four decades, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) populations in North Dakota have been exposed to severe winter weather, drought, predation, harvest, and rapid oil and gas development. Adult pronghorn counts in North Dakota fluctuated over time with an increasing trend from 1974 to 2007, followed by a rapid decline from2008 to 2012. Our primary objective was to identify key drivers of an index of pronghorn abundance in western North Dakota over this period to inform conservation and management. Despite missing data, Bayesian mixed-effects models allowed us to analyze variation in annual population count data relative to weather conditions, coyote populations, oil and gas development, human harvest, and agricultural practices.We found that lower indices of abundance correspondedwith heavy snowfall and lowwinter temperatures, suggesting that the large observed decline starting in 2008 was primarily due to severe winter weather conditions.We also found that the abundance index was negatively correlated with road and oil/gas well density, of which the; latter increased exponentially during the last decade. In contrast, we found little evidence that coyote populations, drought, and human harvest were major drivers of observed population declines. Based on these findings, we expect that pronghorn populations will be negatively influenced by the anticipated increase in winter storm frequency and continued expansion of oil and gas development. Roads, fences, and development may impede pronghorn movement to more hospitable areas during winter storms, thereby hindering their ability to escape extreme conditions."
275,1778,Effects of Typhoon Disturbance on the Abundances of Two Mid-Water Fish Species in a Mountain Stream of Northern Taiwan,"The objective of this study was to use a 9 yr dataset to evaluate the responses of Onychostoma barbatula and Candidia barbata abundances to 3 typhoon events in a mountain stream of northern Taiwan. The association of habitat variables with fish abundances was also explored. Bimonthly electrofishing was conducted at 4 sampling sites, and habitat variables of water depth and stream length were measured after each fish sampling. Few or no significant differences in fish abundances for each site were identified among bimonthly sampling periods and years. Abundance variations did not significantly differ before and after typhoon periods in the 9 yr dataset, in typhoon years, or in non-typhoon years. These results indicated that typhoon impacts on the abundances of these 2 mid-water fishes are minor despite the potential for habitat alteration in mountain streams of Taiwan. Mid-water fish in Taiwan may adapt to flow fluctuations in mountain stream by their good swimming performance, and by staying in or quickly dispersing to deeper regions as refuges. Based on the results of this study, typhoons invading Taiwan during the wet season should be cautiously regarded as a natural disturbance. However, floods caused by typhoons which occur in the dry season may still cause reproductive threats to aquatic organisms in Taiwan. Given that global warming may become more serious in the future, greater emphasis should be placed on determining drought impacts on stream organisms in Taiwan as there is currently a lack of academic information and in situ experience."
276,1671,Effects of flooding on avian top-predators and their invertebrate prey in a monsoonal Taiwan stream,"1. The effects of flooding on top predators are poorly understood globally, but particularly in monsoonal streams. We therefore attempted to assess how inter-annual and intra-annual variations in flood magnitude affected an obligate riverine predator, the brown dipper (Cinclus pallasii), and its invertebrate prey, in the mountain Tachia River, Taiwan. Major flooding in one of the study years (2005) allowed an insight into the effects of abnormally large flows. 2. The abundance and biomass of insects, and the abundance of dippers, decreased steadily from 2003 to 2005 as flood magnitude grew, but then increased in 2006 when more typical discharge returned. Dipper abundance, insect abundance and insect biomass were all strongly positively inter-related, but negatively related to discharge. Insect biomass, rather than abundance, was more useful in predicting brown dipper abundance. 3. Aquatic insect composition fluctuated among sampling years, revealed by non-metric multidimensional scaling, and these fluctuations were also related to discharge. In turn, dipper abundance and the mean body size of aquatic insects declined with the shift in insect composition as flow increased. 4. These data illustrate how discharge fluctuations can have pronounced effects on top predators in streams, mediated in this case by fluctuating prey abundance. While contributions from bird movement, breeding performance and mortality were not clearly differentiated, our data reveal how dippers have strategies to accommodate varying discharge in river systems. We suggest that the effects of floods on dippers should be taken into account when using this group as indicators of river quality. "
277,2994,"Long-term population changes of Adélie, Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins in the regions of SSSI No. 8 and SSSI No. 34, King George Island, Antarctica","Population estimates of Adelie, chinstrap, and gentoo penguins were obtained at the SSSI No. 8 during 1990, 1992, and between 1994 and 1996, and at the SSSI No. 34 between 1994 and 1996. The most numerous species at both localities were the Adelie penguin population, which appears to be fairly stable in the region of SSSI No. 8, oscillating at the level of 17 000 nests. However, in the region SSSI No. 34 the Adelie population decreased. The gentoo penguin population doubled in the region of SSSI No. 34 since 1980, but decreased in the region of SSSI No. 8. Significant decreases in chinstrap nest numbers in both sites were found during the study period. This pattern mirrors the general pattern of the Pygoscelis penguin population changes in the Antarctic Peninsula region. There is increasing concern that tourism and other human-related activities may negatively impact penguin populations. However, our data are insufficient to prove that hypothesis."
278,4131,"Invasive parasites, habitat change and heavy rainfall reduce breeding success in Darwin's finches","Invasive alien parasites and pathogens are a growing threat to biodiversity worldwide, which can contribute to the extinction of endemic species. On the Galapagos Islands, the invasive parasitic fly Philornis downsi poses a major threat to the endemic avifauna. Here, we investigated the influence of this parasite on the breeding success of two Darwin's finch species, the warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea) and the sympatric small tree finch (Camarhynchus parvulus), on Santa Cruz Island in 2010 and 2012. While the population of the small tree finch appeared to be stable, the warbler finch has experienced a dramatic decline in population size on Santa Cruz Island since 1997. We aimed to identify whether warbler finches are particularly vulnerable during different stages of the breeding cycle. Contrary to our prediction, breeding success was lower in the small tree finch than in the warbler finch. In both species P. downsi had a strong negative impact on breeding success and our data suggest that heavy rain events also lowered the fledging success. On the one hand parents might be less efficient in compensating their chicks' energy loss due to parasitism as they might be less efficient in foraging on days of heavy rain. On the other hand, intense rainfalls might lead to increased humidity and more rapid cooling of the nests. In the case of the warbler finch we found that the control of invasive plant species with herbicides had a significant additive negative impact on the breeding success. It is very likely that the availability of insects (i.e. food abundance)is lower in such controlled areas, as herbicide usage led to the removal of the entire understory. Predation seems to be a minor factor in brood loss."
279,4014,"Diversity, abundance and nesting phenology of the wading birds of Bahía Kino, Sonora, México","The occurrence and nesting phenology of Ardeidae species and other wading birds were documented; from 2009-2013 in the Bahía Kino bioregion of western Sonora, México. Two active colonies were surveyed:; in a mangrove (Avicennia germinans; Rhizophora mangle) estuary and on a nearshore desert island. Thirteen species; of nesting wading birds were recorded, 11 of which are year-round residents and two occurring only during the; breeding season; two additional species were documented only in migration. The most abundant species was the; Snowy Egret (Egretta thula), which had a peak of 234 nests in 2012. Of particular conservation interest is the Reddish; Egret (E. rufescens), which had a peak of 149 nests in 2012. Potential prey of wading birds in the estuary was; also sampled, with special focus on brachyuran crabs, which constitute the main prey items of the Yellow-crowned; Night-Heron (Nyctanassa violacea). The rapid development of the region, and especially the establishment of largescale; mariculture operations along Estero Santa Cruz, has the potential to impact local wading bird populations,; and thus an understanding of wading bird diversity, abundance and habitat use may prove critical to inform future; management and conservation initiatives."
280,2098,"Changes in a population of orange roughy, Hoplostethus atlanticus, with commercial exploitation on the Challenger Plateau, New Zealand","The commercial fishery for orange roughy on the Challenger Plateau developed in 1981, increased markedly throughout the mid-1980s, and then declined rapidly by 1990. Data from research trawl surveys and commercial fishing returns over the period are examined, and changes in the population are described. The distribution of orange roughy changed over the period examined; there was a contraction of the areas of high density and apparent fishing-out of aggregations on relatively flat bottom. Aggregations are now largely confined to pinnacles. Biomass of orange roughy, measured by bottom trawl survey indices and commercial catch per unit of effort, declined substantially and is currently estimated to be about 20% of virgin levels. Most other incidental species in the trawl surveys have also declined in abundance, and there are no indications of 'species replacement.' Data on size, reproductive stage, size at maturity, and feeding have also been examined. Size structure of the population has not changed over time. Time of spawning (July) and the pattern of gonad development have been consistent over the years. Diet composition has also remained similar; dominant prey groups are natant decapod crustaceans and small fish. It is suggested that biological changes have not been apparent because orange roughy are a long-lived, slow-growing species, with low productivity. There could be a long response time to fishing pressure, yet orange roughy populations can be quickly reduced to low levels by commercial fishing."
281,2589,Chick provisioning and breeding success of Adélie penguins at Béchervaise Island over eight successive seasons,"Data on foraging trip durations and meal sizes were collected by means of an automated monitoring system from breeding Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at Béchervaise Island over eight breeding seasons, commencing in 1991-92. Significant interannual differences in duration of foraging trips, meal sizes and diet composition were observed. These parameters were correlated with breeding success and fledging masses, and provide useful indicators of food availability during the breeding season. Chicks were particularly vulnerable to a decreased availability of food during the first 3 weeks after hatching."
282,1528,Population shifts in two competing fish species on a degrading coral reef.,"I monitored the populations of 2 fishes on a coral reef in St Croix, U. S. Virgin Islands, from 1980 to 1995 to determine if they could track changes in their habitat. Starting in the mid-1970s, white band disease killed all the elkhorn corals Acropora palmate, providing access to a variety of boring organisms that create the cavities inhabited by the spinyhead blenny Acanthemblemaria spinosa and the roughhead blenny A. aspera. As the corals became more heavily bored, they were weakened and collapsed, providing more of the low habitat occupied by roughheads and less of the high habitat occupied by spinyheads. This structural change was generally gradual but Hurricane Hugo destroyed almost all the remaining standing dead corals in 1989. Both species increased in density until 1989 when the sudden reduction of high habitat caused a decrease in spinyhead population density. In contrast, roughheads continued their population growth until 1991 after which they also declined. Although previous work has shown that spinyheads can displace roughheads from preferred habitat, spinyheads did not increase their numbers close to the reef surface as the high corals collapsed. I hypothesize that their inflexible minimum height is due to their previously demonstrated higher metabolic rate which constrains them to the higher locations where planktonic food is more abundant. Consequently, the species mix shifted from one of spinyheads with extremely rare roughheads in 1980 to one dominated by roughheads with few spinyheads in 1995. This precise tracking of a changing environment suggests resource limitation and is counter to the widespread view that coral reef fish assemblages are largely unsaturated systems consisting of open, recruitment-limited populations. The fishes studied here may be atypical, however, and it is suggested that more studies with a mechanistic approach may provide insight into reef fish assemblage structure."
283,4189,Population trends in Pacific Oceanic sharks and the utility of regulations on shark finning,"Accurate assessment of shark population status is essential for conservation but is often constrained by limited and unreliable data. To provide a basis for improved management of shark resources, we analyzed a long-term record of species-specific catches, sizes, and sexes of sharks collected by onboard observers in the western and central Pacific Ocean from 1995 to 2010. Using generalized linear models, we estimated population-status indicators on the basis of catch rate and biological indicators of fishing pressure on the basis of median size to identify trends for blue (Prionace glauca), mako (Isurus spp.), oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus), and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks. Standardized catch rates of longline fleets declined significantly for blue sharks in the North Pacific (by 5% per year [CI 2% to 8%]), for mako sharks in the North Pacific (by 7% per year [CI 3% to 11%]), and for oceanic whitetip sharks in tropical waters (by 17% per year [CI 14% to 20%]). Median lengths of silky and oceanic whitetip sharks decreased significantly in their core habitat, and almost all sampled silky sharks were immature. Our results are consistent with results of analyses of similar data sets. Combined, these results and evidence of targeted fishing for sharks in some regional fisheries heighten concerns for sustainable utilization, particularly for oceanic whitetip and North Pacific blue sharks. Regional regulations that prohibit shark finning (removal of fins and discarding of the carcass) were enacted in 2007 and are in many cases the only form of control on shark catches. However, there is little evidence of a reduction of finning in longline fisheries. In addition, silky and oceanic whitetip sharks are more frequently retained than finned, which suggests that even full implementation of and adherence to a finning prohibition may not substantially reduce mortality rates for these species. We argue that finning prohibitions divert attention from assessing whether catch levels are sustainable and that the need for management of sharks should not be addressed by measures that are simple to implement but complex to enforce and evaluate."
284,972,"Population development and changes in winter site use by the Svalbard light-bellied brent goose, Branta bernicla hrota 1980-1994","The Svalbard breeding population of light-bellied brent goose Branta bernicla hrota, wintering in 4-5 sites in Denmark and at Lindisfarne in north-east England, increased from c. 3500-4000 in the early 1980s to 4000-5800 in the early 1990s. The increase was mainly due to years with good breeding success, but probably also to improved survival in mild winters. Thus, in cold winters it was observed that mortality, of at least first-winter birds, increased. Major changes in winter site use were observed during the 1980s; the use of the Danish Wadden Sea decreased, and in consequence, the brent geese arrived earlier at Lindisfarne and at the main winter site, Mariager-Randers Fjords. In the course of winter the population now disperses to more sites and new wintering sites have been established; in spring the majority of the population is concentrated in two sites in north-west Jutland in Denmark. The changed pattern of movement reflects decreases in distribution of Zostera food resources and depletion of the remaining resources due to waterfowl grazing, which may negatively affect condition of the geese in winter and ultimately survival. On the other hand, the population is now more dispersed during winter and hence less vulnerable to local environmental pertubations. The wider dispersal and changed phenology have several implications for management of the population which are discussed."
285,2590,Breeding performance of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at a colony exposed to high levels of human disturbance,"Port Lockroy, situated on the Antarctic Peninsula, is one of the most visited tourist sites in Antarctica. The effects of visitor disturbance on the breeding performance of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at Goudier Island, Port Lockroy was investigated during the austral summer of 1996/1997 by comparing pairs in treatment areas (visited by 35-55 tourists every 12 days) and control colonies (not visited by tourists). There were no differences between the two groups in the proportion of birds that laid, in hatching success or the proportion of single-chick broods. Pairs in treatment colonies laid a higher proportion of single-egg clutches, but this was related to colony location and unusually high snow accumulation. Most treatment colonies were situated on low-lying ground or in the lee of buildings, and probably had more late layers at the initial census. Only 11% of tourist visits had occurred by laying, making human disturbance an unlikely explanation for the higher proportion of single-egg clutches. Nests monitored in a disturbed colony and a control colony showed no differences in chick mass or survival up to 20 days of age. The overall breeding success, based on counts of creched birds, was similar to other southern populations of gentoo penguins, after correcting for mortality between creching and fledging. Historical data from Goudier Island indicate that the colony established itself in 1985 and has rapidly increased in size since then. The neighbouring colony at Alice Creek, which has been regularly visited by tourists for at least a decade, has also shown a population increase, although this expansion has been at a slower rate. We conclude that disturbance from tourist visits is unlikely to have been a major determinant of gentoo population change at Port Lockroy."
286,2007,"Predicting population survival under future climate change: density dependence, drought and extraction in an insular bighorn sheep","Our understanding of the interplay between density dependence, climatic perturbations, and conservation practices on the dynamics of small populations is still limited. This can result in uninformed strategies that put endangered populations at risk. Moreover, the data available for a large number of populations in such circumstances are sparse and mined with missing data. Under the current climate change scenarios, it is essential to develop appropriate inferential methods that can make use of such data sets. 2. We studied a population of desert bighorn sheep introduced to Tiburon Island, Mexico in 1975 and subjected to irregular extractions for the last 10 years. The unique attributes of this population are absence of predation and disease, thereby permitting us to explore the combined effect of density dependence, environmental variability and extraction in a 'controlled setting.' Using a combination of nonlinear discrete models with long-term field data, we constructed three basic Bayesian state space models with increasing density dependence (DD), and the same three models with the addition of summer drought effects. 3. We subsequently used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the combined effect of drought, DD, and increasing extractions on the probability of population survival under two climate change scenarios (based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predictions): (i) increase in drought variability; and (ii) increase in mean drought severity. 4. The population grew from 16 individuals introduced in 1975 to close to 700 by 1993. Our results show that the population's growth was dominated by DD, with drought having a secondary but still relevant effect on its dynamics. 5. Our predictions suggest that under climate change scenario (i), extraction dominates the fate of the population, while for scenario (ii), an increase in mean drought affects the population's probability of survival in an equivalent magnitude as extractions. Thus, for the long-term survival of the population, our results stress that a more variable environment is less threatening than one in which the mean conditions become harsher. Current climate change scenarios and their underlying uncertainty make studies such as this one crucial for understanding the dynamics of ungulate populations and their conservation. "
287,4577,Spatial and temporal variation in population dynamics of Andean frogs: Effects of forest disturbance and evidence for declines,"Biodiversity loss is a global phenomenon that can result in the collapse of food webs and critical ecosystem services. Amphibian population decline over the last century is a notable case of species loss because amphibians survived the last four major extinction events in global history, their current rate of extinction is unprecedented, and their rate of extinction is greater than that for most other taxonomic groups. Despite the severity of this conservation problem and its relevance to the study of global biodiversity loss, major knowledge gaps remain for many of the most threatened species and regions in the world. Rigorous estimates of population parameters are lacking for many amphibian species in the Neotropics. The goal of our study was to determine how the demography of seven species of the genus Pristimantis varied over time and space in two cloud forests in the Ecuadorian Andes. We completed a long term capture-mark-recapture study to estimate abundance, survival, and population growth rates in two cloud forests in the Ecuadorian Andes; from 2002 to 2009 at Yanayacu in the Eastern Cordillera and from 2002 to 2003 at Cashca Totoras in the Western Cordillera. Our results showed seasonal and annual variation in population parameters by species and sex. P. bicantus experienced significant reductions in abundance over the course of our study. Abundance, apparent survival, and population growth rates were lower in disturbed than in primary or mature secondary forest. The results of our study raise concerns for the population status of understudied amphibian groups and provide insights into the population dynamics of Neotropical amphibians."
288,3026,"Effects of marine reserve protection at Goat Island, northern New Zealand","The possible effects that marine reserve protection has had on densities of some reef fish and large invertebrates were investigated near Leigh (north-eastern New Zealand) by a series of sampling programmes between 1976 and 1988. Fish counts at intervals during the 6 years after the initial establishment of the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve in 1975 suggested that red moki {Cheilodactylus spectabilis) had increased in abundance whereas five others had remained at approximately constant densities. A comparison of data between 1978 and 1988 also revealed few consistent differences in fish abundances. A detailed survey in 1988 between sites inside and outside the marine reserve showed no clear patterns for sea urchins (Evechinus chloroticus) and several fish; trends for increased abundances in the marine reserve of fish such as snapper Pagrus (=Chrysophrys) auratus, blue cod (Parapercis colias), and red moki; a very striking increase in numbers of rock lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) within the marine reserve; and an obvious trend for increased size of snapper in the marine reserve. Most of the trends, however, were not statistically significant, owing largely to the low power of the tests used. Although it is now generally accepted that the creation of marine reserves such as the one at Leigh results in increased abundances of certain organisms, our study highlights the difficulty of rigorously demonstrating this, especially for patchily distributed and mobile fish species."
289,3264,Waterbird monitoring in Ireland 2000/01: results of the seventh year of the Irish Wetland Bird Survey (I-WeBS),"This paper summarises the results of the seventh year of the Irish Wetland Bird Survey, placing; the results in the context of previous years, especially those since 1996/97. Counts of over; 350 sites were carried out in 2000/01, with most major wetlands being covered at least once.; Monthly coverage was similar to that attained in previous years though access to rural are a s; due to Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions affected spring counts. Counts were below the; long-term average for most species. Peaks of Little Egret, Greylag Goose, Shoveler and; Ringed Plover were, however, the highest recorded yet during I-WeBS counts. Peak counts of; Shoveler at two sites were the highest yet re c o rded. A peak count of Coot at Lough Corrib; exceeded the international threshold level for the third time, making this site easily the most; important in Britain and Ireland. Provisional trends suggest increases in the latter two species; together with Oystercatcher, Bar-tailed Godwit and Curlew. In contrast, most duck species,; Grey Plover, Dunlin and Black-tailed Godwit appear to have declined and populations of; largely sedentary species such as Great Crested Grebe, Mute Swan and Mallard appeare d; to be stable. 8 sites hold more than 20,000 waterbirds on average; a further 15 sites hold; numbers exceeding 10,000 waterbirds.

The; importance of continued long-term monitoring for assessment of site importance for; individual species, periodic revisions of population estimates and analysis of national trends in; populations is discussed."
290,4350,"Trends in biomarkers, biotic indices, and fish population size revealed contrasting long-term effects of recycled water on the ecological status of a Mediterranean river","Recycled water is important for maintaining river flow in semi-arid regions. However, it has ecological risk, as suggested by comparison of habitat and white and red blood cell count in two wild fish species (Barbus meridionalis and Squalius laietanus) before and after an input of recycled water in Ripoll River (NE Spain) in 2009. Due to the lack of normal ranges for blood variables in wild fish, we surveyed seasonally the same river reaches in 2013 to test if blood alterations from 2009 compromised the viability of the fish populations. By examining other indicators of river health in baseline and polluted sites (fish abundance, mass-length relationships, and community indices in fish, diatoms and invertebrates), we tested for the superior utility of blood tests in biomonitoring. The comparison of water quality and scores of diatoms and invertebrate indices between polluted and reference sites showed that polluted sites improved from 2009 to 2013. The abundance of B. meridionalis also increased in polluted sites, but that of S. laietanus declined in 2013 compared to 2009. These results contrast with results of blood analyses in 2009, which suggested that B. meridionalis was more seriously affected by pollution than S. laietanus. The fish index did not reveal the risk of recycled water to fish health, whereas fish mass-length relationships suggested that S. laietanus individuals in 2013 had a better body condition in polluted than in reference sites. Given that the two fish species had opposite results in reference sites, and that the physical habitat was more suitable for B. meridionalis in polluted sites in 2013 than was for S. laietanus, trends in population size are not only explained by pollution. The role of phenology is suggested by peaks in blood disorders during the breeding season. However, more long-term studies combining indicators of river health at the individual and community scales are needed to fully assess the ecological risk of recycled water in this river. These studies will also help to develop blood tests as reliable health indicators in wild fish populations."
291,3786,"Evidence of a declining Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) population at Lake Sibaya, South Africa","Formerly widespread throughout the waterbodies of eastern South Africa, viable Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) populations are now restricted to three disjunct protected areas in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Mpumalanga and Limpopo. Growing evidence suggests that protected populations are declining, including the breeding C. niloticus population at Lake Sibaya in KZN. Aerial surveys were conducted at Lake Sibaya from 2003-2004 and 2007-2009, spotlight counts in 2003 and intensive nesting surveys in 2003 and 2004. Seven adults were counted during the 2009 aerial survey; an 89% decrease from the 1985 count (62 adults) and a decline of 95-98% of the estimated 1970 adult population. Likewise, in 1970 30 nests were recorded, compared to three nests in 2003 and no recorded nests in 2004. The non-hatchling population in 2003 was estimated at 48 individuals and decreased to an estimated eight in 2009. The neighbouring community perceives crocodiles as a threat to their lives and livestock, and increasing human pressures on C. niloticus in the area will probably ensure that the population will not recover naturally. Unless crocodiles are perceived as a useful or somehow beneficial natural resource by the surrounding community, the species faces possible extirpation from Lake Sibaya in the future."
292,3166,Changes in Tundra swan Cygnus columbianus bewickii distribution and abundance in the Yangtze River floodplain,"Approximately 75% of the East Asian Flyway Tundra Swan Cygnus columbianus bewickii population winters in the Yangtze River floodplain, China. Historically the species was more widely distributed throughout the floodplain but now most of the population is confined to five wetlands in Anhui Province and to Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province, where the majority (up to 113,000 birds) occur. Within-winter counts suggest that swans congregate at Poyang Lake before dispersing to other sites later in the winter. Counts show large between-year fluctuations, but suggest declines at Shengjin and Fengsha Lakes (both in Anhui) during the last five years. Declines at Shengjin Lake are likely due to decreases in submerged vegetation (particularly tuber-producing Vallisneria, a major food item) perhaps linked to eutrophication. Range contractions throughout the floodplain may also be linked to reductions in submerged vegetation coverage elsewhere. Changes in water quality and lake hydrology post-Three Gorges Dam may have adversely affected submerged vegetation productivity. Key information needs for the effective implementation of conservation measures for Tundra Swans include: (1) annual surveys of all major wintering sites throughout each winter to establish the importance of different sites during the non-breeding period; (2) more information on swan diets at important sites; and (3) an assessment of adverse effects of water quality and lake water levels post-Three Gorges Dam on submerged vegetation productivity at Poyang Lake and other important sites.

293,3028,Abundance and interchange of humpback whales in Oceania based on fluke photo-identification and DNA profiling,"The abundance of humpback whales on breeding grounds from Oceania (New Caledonia to French Polynesia), was estimated ; using individual identification photographs collected between 1999 and 2004 and microsatellite genotypes collected between ; 1999 and 2005. Both datasets were reviewed for quality control, resulting in a total photo-ID catalogue of 660 individuals and a ; genotype catalogue or DNA register of 436 males and 277 females. A number of estimates were calculated using both open and; closed models, including sex-specific estimates from the genotypes. The population estimates showed some variation depending ; on the assumptions of the models and different pooling of the sighting-resighting histories (e.g., by dataset, by sex, by region, or ; pooled across regions by year). Using closed population estimates, the regional estimates of abundance were greatest for Tonga ; (N=1,840 using genotypes and N=1,168 CV=0.16 using photo-ID), with about half this number in French Polynesia (N=934 using ; genotypes and 440 CV=0.23 using photo-ID) and New Caledonia (N=804 using genotypes and 383 CV=0.35 using photo-ID). A ; Pradel model showed no significant trend in abundance for this population, supporting the conclusion from previous population ; dynamic models that recovery in the region is much lower than in the adjacent eastern Australia. The genotype database revealed ; a sex-bias in capture towards males (1.6:1 males : females), so genotypic estimates of abundance were derived by doubling the ; male-specific estimates, assuming that the true sex ratio is at parity. For the purposes of future modelling efforts intended for ; completing of the Comprehensive Assessment, we consider the most optimistic estimate of total abundance for Oceania to be ; 3,520 whales (CV = 0.1) in 2005, using the POPAN model estimate of total super-population abundance. There is a significant ; transience signal in the dataset, which may indicate that a proportion of the whales captured in the survey region are travelling to ; areas not yet surveyed in Oceania. The POPAN super-population estimate is therefore favoured because it is inclusive of both ; animals resident to the surveyed breeding grounds and those migrating past to unsurveyed regions. However it is likely to be ; positively biased by the assumption of zero mortality over the survey period. Among all other male-derived genotype abundance ; estimates presented in this study (range of N=1,000-4,800), the male-specific Pradel and POPAN estimates from 2003 were ; closely similar (doubled estimates of males; POPAN N=2,361 CV=0.11; Pradel N=2,304). We therefore propose the POPAN ; estimate in 2003 as a reasonable estimate of abundance in the primary survey regions in Oceania, but conclude that true ; abundance in the wider Oceania area is likely to fall between this estimate and the higher super-population estimate of 3,520 ; whales.

294,684,Demographic changes in a Snow Goose population: biological and management implications,"Describes the demography of a lesser snow goose Anser caerulescens caerulescens colony at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, which has been the subject of a detailed study since 1973. Fecundity initially exceeded mortality and the population growth of c8% per annum could be accounted for by local recruitment. Immigration and emigration of females is an infrequent event. Most breeding males in the population are immigrants from other colonies and thus the demography of the LPB colony may be affected by conditions at other colonies. During the course of the study the colony has increased in size and three fitness components have changed systematically. Clutch size has declined by 0.7 eggs, gosling weight at fledging (and subsequent adult weight) has decreased by 11% and first-year survival has decreased significantly. This has resulted in a decline in the growth rate of the population and is consistent with the operation of density-dependent processes. All these declines could be explained by a decline in the quality and availability of food, and the decline in gosling weight and first-year survival strongly suggests degradation of the arctic salt-marshes where geese rear their broods. Snow geese nest in large colonies and colony demography is probably driven by local food availability. There may be a natural growth and decline of colonies and as long as new arctic salt-marshes are available and protected, the overall population can remain stable. -from Authors"
295,945,"Derby-determined vital statistics and trends of the Smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu, recreational fishery in the middle reaches of the Grand river, Ontario","Data from Grand River Bass Derbies (1988-1997) documents trends in relative abundance and provides information on vital statistics of Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in the recreational fishery on the Grand River, Ontario. The length-weight relationship for all fish entered in the derby was described as weight (g) = (2 x 105) x total length (mm)2.95. A significant declining trend in mean fish length existed for the 10 longest fish entered in the derby each year over the 10 year period (r2= 0.071, p < 0.05). Relative weights observed were consistently below the length specific standard of 100, similar to other riverine Smallmouth Bass populations. Age and growth rates were similar to other northern riverine Smallmouth Bass populations, and the oldest fish observed was 16 + (441 mm TL). Trends in the middle Grand River Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) data suggest that the relative abundance of Smallmouth Bass has decreased significantly since 1988 (r2=0.552, p<0.05), although the 10-year derby CPUE (0.36) is similar to CPUE from other nverine populations. The derby data indicates that the population size and structure require further investigations to determine exactly where problems and management opportunities exist."
296,2846,Source populations in carnivore management: cougar demography and emigration in a lightly hunted population,"Wildlife agencies typically attempt to manage carnivore numbers in localized game management units through hunting, and do not always consider the potential influences of immigration and emigration on the outcome of those hunting practices. However, such a closed population structure may not be an appropriate model for management of carnivore populations where immigration and emigration are important population parameters. The closed population hypothesis predicts that high hunting mortality will reduce numbers and densities of carnivores and that low hunting mortality will increase numbers and densities. By contrast, the open population hypothesis predicts that high hunting mortality may not reduce carnivore densities because of compensatory immigration, and low hunting mortality may not result in more carnivores because of compensatory emigration. Previous research supported the open population hypothesis with high immigration rates in a heavily hunted (hunting mortality rate=0.24) cougar population in northern Washington. We test the open population hypothesis and high emigration rates in a lightly hunted (hunting mortality rate=0.11) cougar population in central Washington by monitoring demography from 2002 to 2007. We used a dual sex survival/fecundity Leslie matrix to estimate closed population growth and annual census counts to estimate open population growth. The observed open population growth rate of 0.98 was lower than the closed survival/fecundity growth rates of 1.13 (deterministic) and 1.10 (stochastic), and suggests a 12-15% annual emigration rate. Our data support the open population hypothesis for lightly hunted populations of carnivores. Low hunting mortality did not result in increased numbers and densities of cougars, as commonly believed because of compensatory emigration."
297,3135,Long-term declines in migratory shorebird abundance in north-east Tasmania,"Evidence of long-term declines in migratory shorebird populations is reported at two areas in north-east Tasmania.; In north-east Tasmania, both George Town Reserve and Cape Portland have featured in National Wader Counts; since 1981, although observations go back to the early 1970s. Compared with the extreme north-west of; Tasmania and with many mainland study sites, wader numbers in north-east Tasmania are never large, which; makes for relatively easier counting. At George Town, count data indicate long-term population declines from; 1974 to 2011 in Eastern Curlew, (Numenius madagascariensis), Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres), Curlew; Sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea), and Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica). George Town has also seen a; decrease in the number of migratory shorebird species recorded each year, a drop on average from nine to seven,; while Cape Portland has seen a larger drop in migratory shorebird species richness from eleven to six. Cape; Portland has also experienced long-term declines from 1981 to 2011 in Ruddy Turnstone and Curlew Sandpiper.; The reduction in species richness in both areas relates to historically uncommon species no longer being recorded; such as Red Knot (Calidris canutus), Lesser Sand Plover (Charadrius mongolus), Greater Sand Plover; (Charadrius leschenaultia), Grey-tailed Tattler (Tringa brevipes), Terek Sandpiper (Xenus cinereus) and Grey; Plover (Pluvialis squatarola). Trends derived from these two north-east Tasmanian areas are similar to those being; reported more widely in Australia, with growing numbers of migratory shorebirds showing evidence of long-term; population declines. Threats to the foraging areas of both study sites, which have the potential to compromise their; viability, are outlined. The volume of data available from these areas will allow for more detailed analyses in; future."
298,2034,"Decrease of African penguins at the Possession Island group, 1956-1995: contrasting trends for colonial and solitary breeders","Between 1956 and 1995, the African Penguin Spheniscus demersus population at Possession Island decreased by 96% from 23 245 breeding pairs to 895 pairs. At adjacent North Reef, African Penguins ceased breeding before December 1988. In 1956, 850 pairs bred there. At Possession Island, 22 441 pairs of penguins bred colonially in 1956, but there were only 360 pairs in colonies in 1995 - a decrease of 98%. By contrast, there were 804 solitary breeding pairs in 1956 and 535 in 1995 - a decrease of 33%. All colonies at the southern portion of Possession Island and that at North Reef were abandoned by 1986. In the central and northern portions of Possession Island colonial breeding still persists, but as numbers have decreased colonies have fragmented. Minimal recruitment to the breeding population, probably resulting from food scarcity, is considered the most likely reason for the long-term decrease in penguin numbers. When penguins were abundant, there were insufficient suitable sites for solitary breeding and most birds bred in large colonies. Sites used by solitary breeders provide shade and restrict access by predators. Colonial breeding may have facilitated sharing information on the distribution of, and group foraging on, Sardine Sardinops sagax, the main food of penguins off Namibia in the 1950s."
299,3745,"Birds at Laurie Island, South Orkney Islands, Antarctica: breeding species and their distribution","Bird communities of the ice-free areas of Laurie Island were surveyed during the breeding seasons of 1993/94 and 1994/95. Additional censuses of penguin colonies were made during the 2004/05 season. Twenty-nine seabird species were recorded, of which 15 were breeding. Adélie Penguins Pygoscelis adeliae bred at six localities, primarily on the south coast. This survey showed that the population of Adélie Penguins in the 2004/05 season was 32.3% lower than that found a previous study conducted during the 1983/84 season. Chinstrap Penguins Pygoscelis antarctica are the most numerous pygoscelid penguins in the area. Previous studies showed they had increased between 1948 and 1983 at many colonies. Since then, there was a slight increase in the population between 1983/84 and 1994/95 (from 141 950 to 143 792 breeding pairs, +1.3%). However, populations of Chinstrap Penguins in the Antarctic Peninsula showed different trends in the late 1980s. Because the censuses available from Laurie Island after 1994/95 season were incomplete, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about Chinstrap Penguin population trends. Population size and distribution of several other species breeding in the area are updated, and possible factors affecting short-term changes are discussed."
300,1157,Variation in the abundance of southern fish species in the southern North sea in relation to hydrography and wind,"Is the increased abundance of southern fish species in the southern North Sea during recent years a signal of a long-term trend, or can it be explained by random variability? Time-series data on the abundance of 12 southern fish species were derived from the 1st quarter International Bottom Trawling Surveys 1970-1994. Two periods of increased abundance were identified, one in the mid-1970s and one around 1990. Both periods coincided with positive anomalies of winter temperature and salinity. These anomalies in turn are correlated with the southerly wind component over. The Netherlands, suggesting increased inflow of Atlantic Water through the Strait of Dover. The conclusion is that the increased abundance does not reflect a long-term trend, but is the effect of temporary increased in southerly winds over the southern North Sea, resulting in increased transport of southern fish species into the North Sea, and favourable temperature conditions during winter."
301,2630,"Reef fisheries in Porto Seguro, eastern Brazilian coast","Fish landings in Porto Seguro, in the eastern Brazilian coast, were monitored from September 1997 to August 1999 to describe the predominant species caught, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) and patterns of yields according to depth and season. A total of 223.5 t from 352 fishing trips made by a fleet of 53 boats was monitored. The fishery is conducted at depths from 20 to 150 m. The number of commercially valuable species caught was high (n = 53). Snappers (Ocyurus chrysurus, Lutjanus analis and L. jocu) made up 38% of total catch. Pelagic species such as Coryphaena hippurus, Seriola dumerili, Thunnus albacares and T. atlanticus accounted for 43% while groupers, mainly Mycteroperca bonaci, represented 10%. Relative abundance of these target species was strongly dependent (P < 0.001) upon depth and season. Higher yields of O. chrysurus (>20 kg/fisher per day) were observed between 20 and 40 m, from April to June. During spring-summer, yields of oceanic pelagic species increased rapidly, and catches of C. hippurus (40 kg/fisher per day) rose from November to January. "
302,3397,"Distribution and abundance of breeding and moulting Brant on Banks Island, Northwest Territories, 1992-1994","Aerial surveys were conducted over most (28 414 km2) of southern Banks Island, Northwest Territories, to determine the distribution and abundance of breeding and non-breeding Brant Branta bernicla. In 1992-1993, we estimated that there was an average population of 8745 ± 1115 (standard error) adult Brant on the study area. Taking into account the low densities of Brant that existed in unsurveyed parts of the island, we estimated that at least 10 000 adults were present. Brant were found nesting throughout the study area, including the interior of the island, where earlier observers had not recorded them. The greatest numbers (6455 ± 1007) and densities (0.52/km2) of Brant were found on the western lowlands. Both numbers and densities were considerably lower in the interior and eastern parts of the island. We estimated that there were 116 nesting colonies present on the study region and possibly as many as 130 colonies on all of Banks Island during 1993 (a good nesting year). The total population in the two areas (the western lowlands and the interior/ eastern parts of the island) surveyed in both 1992 and 1993 remained stable. However, the proportion of Brant observed in nesting colonies increased from 6% to 32% between 1992 and 1993, the proportion occurring as dispersed pairs declined from 40% to 22%, and the proportion occurring in flocks of nonbreeders decreased from 54% to 47%. These changes can probably be attributed to the much earlier spring in 1993. In 1992 and 1993, brood surveys were conducted in a 252-km2 area in the western lowlands. The number of broods observed was small; although brood and gosling densities appeared to be higher in 1993 (0.20 broods/km2, 0.34 goslings/km2) than in 1992 (0.07 broods/km2, 0.20 goslings/km2), the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Approximately 2300 Brant moulted within the study area in 1992, 1993, and 1994, primarily on lakes located within 20 km of the west coast. During July of each year, between 1100 and 1500 Brant were captured and banded. Many of the same lakes were used by moulting flocks each year. Brant appeared to show high fidelity to the area where they had previously moulted, and most (88%) birds captured two or more times were <5 km distant from their previous capture site. Nonetheless, we captured 196 Brant (i.e., 5% of the total number handled) that had not been banded originally on Banks Island. Origins of these birds included the mainland of the Northwest Territories 300 km southwest of Banks Island, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and North Slope in Alaska, and Wrangel Island in the Russian Federation. Most Brant moulting on the western lowlands of Banks Island were Black Brant B. b. nigricans, although 11% of the birds could have been classified as Grey-bellied Brant (or Western High-Arctic Brant), which, although they have no official taxonomic status, are thought to be an endangered and unique subspecies by many biologists."
303,3517,Population dynamics of the reef manta ray Manta alfredi in eastern Australia,"The reef manta ray Manta alfredi aggregates at several sites along the east coast of Australia. Photographic identification and mark-recapture methods were used to report on the site affinity, size and structure of this population of M. alfredi. A total of 716 individuals were identified in 1982-2012, including 636 at Lady Elliot Island (LEI), southern Great Barrier Reef. Over 60 % of individuals identified were resighted at least once during the study period. Multiple resightings within and among years imply a high degree of site affinity by individuals to aggregation sites. One individual was sighted 11 times at LEI over a 30-yr period. The sex ratio of this population was significantly biased towards females (1.2:1 female-to-male ratio), and females were more commonly resighted than males. Robust design population models were used to estimate the population size of the winter aggregation at LEI over a 4-yr period. The models estimated up to 456 (95 % CI 399-535) M. alfredi individuals in the population within one winter season and a high annual apparent survival. This study demonstrated that waters around LEI form a key aggregation site for a large portion of the M. alfredi population in east Australian waters. "
304,4148,"Reconstructing ecosystem dynamics in the central Pacific Ocean, 19521998. II. A preliminary assessment of the trophic impacts of fishing and effects on tuna dynamics","Pelagic fisheries in the Pacific Ocean target both large (Thunnus spp.) and small tunas (juveniles of Thunnus spp; Katsuwonus pelamis) but also take billfishes (Xiphias gladius, Makaira spp., Tetrapturus spp., Istiophorus platypterus) and sharks (Prionace glauca, Alopias superciliosus, Isurus oxyrinchus, Carcharhinus longimanus, Galeocerdo cuvieri) as bycatch. We developed a multispecies model using the Ecopath with Ecosim software that incorporated time-series estimates of biomass, fishing mortality, and bycatch rates (1952-1998) to evaluate the relative contributions of fishing and trophic impacts on tuna dynamics in the central Pacific (0°N to 40°N and 130°E to 150°W). The Ecosim model reproduced the observed trends in abundance indices and biomass estimates for most large tunas and billfishes. A decline in predation mortality owing to depletion of large predators was greatest for small yellowfin tuna and could possibly account for apparent increases in biomass. For other tunas, however, predicted changes in predation mortality rates were small (small bigeye) or were overwhelmed by much larger increases in fishing mortality (skipjack and small albacore). Limited evidence of trophic impacts associated with declining apex predator abundance likely results from the difficulties of applying detailed trophic models to open ocean systems in which ecological and fishery data uncertainties are large."
305,3184,"Waders at Lake McLarty, Western Australia","The comprehensive RAOU waterbird survey 1981-1985 (Jaensch et al. 1988) included data from Lake McLarty, Western Australia.; Since then, the ecology of the lake and its utilization by waders has changed drastically. We present the results of an extensive study; of the waders of Lake McLarty conducted from 1996 to 2000. We link the results of the original RAOU survey to the present; findings, how the patterns of wader use have changed since the early 1980s. Historical and current information show that an; extraordinary number and variety of waders visit this ephemeral lake during the summer months. No less than 36 species of wader; have been recorded. Several species occur in sufficient numbers to make this lake a site of national and international significance; according to the Ramsar Convention criteria. We show the seasonal and annual fluctuations in key wader populations at the lake and; how these change with water levels. Lake McLarty is still a relative pristine wetland and concerns are expressed about the impact; nearby development may have on the wader populations. This study provides updated count data that can be used as a reference; source to assist in the preservation of Lake McLarty."
306,1379,THE DECLINE OF FRUIT BATS IN AMERICAN SAMOA DUE TO HURRICANES AND OVERHUNTING,"Populations of the two fruit bat species in American Samoa Pteropus samoensis and P. tonganus have declined dramatically (80-90%) in the past five years due to hurricane losses and subsequent overhunting by villagers. Current estimates are that only 200-400 P. samoensis and 1500-2500 P. tonganus remain on Tutuila Island, which formerly supported the largest bat populations in the Territory. A three-year hunting ban was enacted in 1992, but modeling projections indicate that a much longer recovery period will be required. "
307,4561,"Epidemic disease decimates amphibian abundance, species diversity, and evolutionary history in the highlands of central Panama","Amphibian populations around the world are experiencing unprecedented declines attributed to a chytrid fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Despite the severity of the crisis, quantitative analyses of the effects of the epidemic on amphibian abundance and diversity have been unavailable as a result of the lack of equivalent data collected before and following disease outbreak. We present a community-level assessment combining long-term field surveys and DNA barcode data describing changes in abundance and evolutionary diversity within the amphibian community of El Cope, Panama, following a disease epidemic and mass-mortality event. The epidemic reduced taxonomic, lineage, and phylogenetic diversity similarly. We discovered that 30 species were lost, including five undescribed species, representing 41% of total amphibian lineage diversity in El Cope. These extirpations represented 33% of the evolutionary history of amphibians within the community, and variation in the degree of population loss and decline among species was random with respect to the community phylogeny. Our approach provides a fast, economical, and informative analysis of loss in a community whether measured by species or phylogenetic diversity."
308,2339,"Food, fishing and seabirds in the Benguela upwelling system","The Benguela upwelling system off south-western Africa supports sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus that are harvested by purse-seine fisheries and are the main prey of three endemic seabirds: African Penguin Spheniscus demersus, Cape Gannet Morus capensis and Cape Cormorant Phalacrocorax capensis. There have been large, long-term changes in the abundance and distribution of the fish resources that have influenced seabird populations. After 1956/1957, the numbers of penguins and gannets breeding in Namibia decreased by 90% and 95%, respectively. After 1978/1979, the number of Cape Cormorants breeding in Namibia decreased by 76%. These decreases were significantly related to the biomass of sardine and anchovy in Namibia and are thought to result mainly from a greatly reduced availability of prey. In South Africa, when the sardine collapsed, it was replaced by anchovy. In the Western Cape, the numbers of Cape Gannets and Cape Cormorants were stable after the collapse of the sardine but African Penguins decreased. The sardine resource recovered in the 1980s and 1990s but, at the turn of the century, was displaced to the east, leading to increases and then decreases in the numbers of penguins and gannets in the Western Cape. In the Eastern Cape, there were long-term increases in the numbers of penguins and gannets, until a recent decrease in penguins. In South Africa, the models used to advise allowable catches for sardine and anchovy are being modified to incorporate a model of African Penguins and functional relationships linking penguins and fish stocks. Consideration is also being given to precluding fishing in areas around seabird breeding colonies. "
309,2591,Recent trends in numbers of four species of penguins at the Prince Edward Islands,"Four species of penguin breed regularly at South Africa's Prince Edward Islands: king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus, gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus and southern rockhopper penguin E. chrysocome. In December 2008, it was estimated that some 65 000 pairs of king penguins were incubating eggs at Marion Island, the larger of the two islands in the group, and 2 000 pairs at Prince Edward Island. At Marion Island from 1987 to 2008, there was no long-term trend in numbers of king penguin chicks that survived to the end of the winter period, but there was considerable fluctuation in chick production in the 1990s. It was roughly estimated that on average 88% of king penguin chicks survived the winter period (from April to September/October). Numbers of gentoo penguins at Marion Island decreased from more than 1 300 pairs in the mid-1990s to fewer than 800 pairs in 2003, and then increased to almost 1 100 pairs in 2008 as breeding success improved. Between 1994/1995 and 2008/2009, numbers of macaroni and southern rockhopper penguins at Marion Island decreased by about 30% and 70% respectively. In 2008/2009, some 290 000 pairs of macaroni penguins bred at this island, mostly in two large colonies where there was a progressive decrease in the density of nests. At both these colonies, decreases in numbers breeding followed outbreaks of disease. Inadequate breeding success has influenced the decreases of macaroni and rockhopper penguins. In 2008/2009, some 42 000 pairs of southern rockhopper penguins bred at Marion Island and 12 000 pairs of macaroni penguins and 38 000 pairs of southern rockhopper penguins at Prince Edward Island. "
310,4470,"Competition for Space: Recolonising Seals Displace Endangered, Endemic Seabirds off Namibia","South Africa (Cape) fur seals Actocephalus pusillus pusillus recolonised Mercury Island off South West Africa/Namibia in the early 1980s. By 1986, many endemic seabirds, including endangered and scare species, had been displaced from their breeding sites. The seabirds, already stressed because food resources have been depleted by fisheries, appear unable to compete for space against the heavier seals. Guano scraping has led to a loss of potential refuges and, by lessening the availability of nesting material and the attractiveness of nest sites, may also have weakened the inclination of birds to defend territories. As depleted seal populations recover worldwide, competition between pinnipeds and seabirds for breeding space is likely to increase. "
311,2592,"Breeding numbers and success of Eudyptes penguins at Marion Island, and the influence of mass and time of arrival of adults","At sub-Antarctic Marion Island, there was substantial correlation in the numbers of adults breeding at study colonies of macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) over 26 years, as there was also for eastern rockhopper (E. chrysocome filholi) over 22 years, suggesting that overwintering conditions may influence the proportions of birds breeding. For both species the time of arrival of females for breeding, and for rockhopper penguins the mass of females on arrival, was significantly related to breeding success. Therefore, overwintering conditions may also affect breeding success. Trends in breeding success between study colonies were more strongly correlated for macaroni penguins than for rockhopper penguins. Macaroni penguins have a greater foraging range than rockhopper penguins when breeding, and may be more influenced at this stage by wider-scale environmental phenomena. For macaroni penguins, breeding success was significantly correlated with mass of chicks at fledging. For both species, mass on arrival of males was significantly correlated with that of females. Although both species had low masses on arrival after the El Niño Southern Oscillation event of 1997/98, there was no significant correlation in mass on arrival between the two species. It is likely that at Marion Island their overwintering grounds are different."
312,4471,Seabird breeding populantions decrease along the arid coastline of South Africa’s Northern Cape province,"Numbers of eight seabird species that have bred in coastal areas of South Africa’s arid Northern Cape province have all shown substantial decreases since initial estimates of their abundance were made in the latter part of the twentieth century. Likely drivers of these decreases include reduced availability of food and the loss of suitable breeding habitat, including in the Orange River Estuary and at coastal pans and islands, which has resulted from a variety of human alterations, uses and disturbances. The decreases have contributed to a worsening conservation status of several of the seabirds, some of which are endemic to southern Africa. The more adaptable species appear to have partially offset habitat loss by moving to alternative breeding sites. However, substitute habitat is limited and the more numerous species suffered relatively large decreases. In order to conserve remnant populations it will be necessary to prevent further loss of breeding habitat, restore some former habitats and provide suitable, alternative habitat."
313,2587,"Population dynamics of the African penguin Spheniscus demersus at Robben Island, South Africa","In 1948, a small colony of emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri was discovered breeding on Emperor Island (67° 51′ 52″ S, 68° 42′ 20″ W), in the Dion Islands, close to the West Antarctic Peninsula (Stonehouse 1952). When discovered, the colony comprised approximately 150 breeding pairs; these numbers were maintained until 1970, after which time the colony showed a continuous decline. By 1999 there were fewer than 20 pairs, and in 2009 high-resolution aerial photography revealed no remaining trace of the colony. Here we relate the decline and loss of the Emperor Island colony to a well-documented rise in local mean annual air temperature and coincident decline in seasonal sea ice duration. The loss of this colony provides empirical support for recent studies (Barbraud & Weimerskirch 2001; Jenouvrier et al 2005, 2009; Ainley et al 2010; Barber-Meyer et al 2005) that have highlighted the vulnerability of emperor penguins to changes in sea ice duration and distribution. These studies suggest that continued climate change is likely to impact upon future breeding success and colony viability for this species. Furthermore, a recent circumpolar study by Fretwell & Trathan (2009) highlighted those Antarctic coastal regions where colonies appear most vulnerable to such changes. Here we examine which other colonies might be at risk, discussing various ecological factors, some previously unexplored, that may also contribute to future declines. The implications of this are important for future modelling work and for understanding which colonies actually are most vulnerable. "
314,2035,"Population dynamics of the African penguin Spheniscus demersus at Robben Island, South Africa","African Penguins Spheniscus demersus recolonized Robben Island in 1983 when about nine pairs bred at the island. By 1996, the colony had grown to about 3100 pairs. Adult survival was probably between 0.82 and 0.90 in 1993/94, but fell to 0.75 in 1994/95 when many birds at the island were oiled following the sinking of the Apollo Sea in June 1994. Some penguins initiated breeding when two years old, and all were assumed to be breeding at age five. The proportion of mature birds that bred in a year varied between about 0.70 and 1.00. During a breeding season, pairs laid their first clutches between January and August, mostly in February and March. The average clutch was 1.86 eggs. Of lost clutches 32% were replaced, whereas 23% of pairs losing broods relayed and 21% of pairs that successfully fledged chicks relayed. On only one occasion was the laying of a third clutch during a breeding season recorded, and this was unsuccessful. The mean number of chicks fledged per breeding pair varied between 0.32 and 0.59 per annum. Both fledging success and immigration of immature birds to the colony were significantly related to the spawner biomass of Cape Anchovy Engraulis capensis, the most important prey item of penguins at the island. Growth of the colony has been driven by immigration. Depending on the values assumed for survival of adults and first-year birds, 59-87% of new adults in the colony resulted from immigration. Several birds banded as chicks at Dassen and Dyer islands were recorded breeding at Robben Island."
315,4453,Population trends of seabirds breeding in South Africa's Eastern Cape and the possible influence of anthropogenic and environmental change,"Eleven species of seabird breed in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province. Numbers of African Penguin Spheniscus demersus and Cape Gannet Morus capensis in the province increased in the 20th century, but penguins decreased in the early 21st century. A recent eastward displacement of Sardine Sardinops sagax off South Africa increased the availability of this food source to gannets but did not benefit penguins, which have a shorter foraging range. Fishing and harbour developments may have influenced the recent decrease of penguins. Cape Cormorant Phalacrocorax capensis and Swift Tern Thalasseus bergii also feed on sardine and increased in the Eastern Cape in the early part of the 21st century. There has been a recent increase in the Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus population in South Africa's Indian Ocean sector, which includes the eastern portion of the Western Cape Province. Hartlaub's Gull L. hartlaubii and Damara Tern Sterna balaenarum, which have their main populations in the Benguela system off western southern Africa, were first recorded in the Eastern Cape in the late 1970s and later shown to be breeding there. Numbers of White-breasted Cormorant P. lucidus and Caspian Tern Hydroprogne caspia breeding in this province have been stable, but those of Grey-headed Gull L. cirrocephalus and Roseate Tern St. dougallii have increased since the early 1990s. The former three species also breed at inland localities; the Roseate Tern is at the western extent of its distribution in the Indian Ocean. Although not yet breeding in the Eastern Cape, the Crowned Cormorant P. coronatus, another western species, has extended its range to this province. Congruent changes in the distributions and abundance of several marine species off South Africa, and similar changes elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, suggest that large-scale environmental change may be influencing the distribution and abundance of species. Conservation will need to account for these as well as for anthropogenic impacts."
316,1165,Trends of African penguin Spheniscus demersus populations in the 20th century,"The entire nesting population of African penguins Spheniscus demersus was about 575 000 adults at the start of the 20th century. Numbers halved by the 1950s and continued to fall to about 220 000 by the late 1970s and about 180 000 by the early 1990s. In Namibia, there has been a 30% reduction since the late 1970s, the most severe declines being in the south, where colonies continue to decrease. Populations at Mercury, lchaboe and Halifax islands now appear to be stable. In South Africa, numbers fell by 17% between the late 1970s and early 1990s, with especially severe decreases near Saldanha Bay and at Dassen and Dyer islands. These decreases have been arrested, except at Dyer Island. Three new colonies were established in the Western Cape in the early 1980s and supported about 10 000 adult birds in 1994. At islands in Algoa Bay, numbers of adults increased by nearly 30 000 between the late 1970s and the early 1990s, with large increases at St Croix and Bird islands. Ongoing deterioration in the status of the species is being driven by the trends at Dyer Island and off southern Namibia, the causes of which must be investigated. "
317,2602,Recent population trends of jackass penguins Spheniscus demersus off Southern Africa,"Between the late 1970s and the mid 1980s there were large decreases in numbers of jackass penguins Spheniscus demersus breeding near the centre of the species' distribution, whereas near the periphery of its breeding range numbers either decreased less severely or remained stable. Similar trends had been observed between the mid 1950s and the late 1970s, with the exception that at some peripheral localities numbers had been increasing. The persistence in regional trends reflects an altered distribution of prey organisms. As most colonies occur at the centre of the species' distribution, overall numbers of jackass penguins have continued to decrease rapidly. Some colonies have been reduced to low levels, increasing their susceptibility to site-specific effects and extinction. The conservation status of the jackass penguin, which is now heavily reliant on two island colonies, is expected to continue to deteriorate until prey is again abundant in the central region. Measures that might alleviate the situation are proposed. "
318,3189,"Continuing decline in wader populations at Pelican Point, Western Australia, since 1971","Surveys of waders at Pelican Point, on the Swan River estuary in Perth WA, have been made weekly from; November to February since 1971. There has been a general decline to almost zero in numbers of individuals and; in frequency of 9 trans-equatorial migrants, but not of 4 local non-migratory waders. Non-wader water birds were; also monitored. Some species have been seen less frequently than in earlier years (e.g. larger cormorants, terns,; Silver Gull, Grey Teal). However, others have been relatively constant or were present more often than in earlier; years (e.g. smaller cormorants, Fairy Tern, Black Swan). Changes at Pelican Point include greater recreational use; especially by water craft and kite surfers. There has been a marked decrease in rainfall in the catchment area so; that the water may be more saline. However the continued presence of local waders and other waterbirds suggests; these changes cannot explain the decline in trans-equatorial waders."
319,2673,"Distribution and Status of the Guiana Dolphin Sotalia guianensis (Cetacea, Delphinidae) Population in Babitonga Bay, Southern Brazil","The Guiana dolphin Sotalia guianensis is one of the most endangered small cetaceans in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The population abundance and density of this species were estimated in Babitonga Bay in 2000-2003. Sampling was random and stratified, and a line transect method with distance sampling was applied in an area of 160 km2. The total length of transects covered was 1251.9 km, with 163 groups of dolphins recorded. Group sizes varied 2-30 (mean, 5.3; SD, 5.6) individuals. Some areas were preferred by the population, and area 3 was considered the core area of S. guianensis in Babitonga Bay. The abundance was estimated to be 245 (95% confidence interval (CI): 142-422) individuals between Dec. 2000 and Nov. 2001, 186 (95% CI: 93-374) individuals between Apr. 2002 and Feb. 2003, and 179 (95% CI: 93-344) individuals between Mar. and Dec. 2003, and the densities were estimated at 1.6 (95% CI: 1-2.7), 1.2 (95% CI: 0.6-2.4), and 1.3 (95% CI: 0.5-3.4) individuals/km2, respectively.

320,3551,Abundance and distribution of endangered Franciscana dolphins in Argentine waters and conservation implications,"This is the first study in Argentine waters on the abundance of the threatened Franciscana dolphin, Pontoporia blainvillei. During 2003-2004 we carried out 17 aerial surveys using line transect sampling methodology. We observed 101 Franciscanas in 71 sightings. In northern areas density was estimated at 0.106 individual/km2. Density was lower in southern areas (0.055/km2) and declined with depth beyond 30-m isobaths (0.05/km2). A correction factor for submerged dolphins was applied to density and then extrapolated to the strip between the coastline and the 30-m isobath. Abundance in the northern area was estimated at 8,279 (4,904-13,960) individuals, while in the southern area it was estimated at 5,896 (1,928-17,999) individuals. Considering an annual mortality of about 500-800 individuals, about 3.5%-5.6% of the stock may be removed each year by the fishery and over the 2% recommended by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and may not be sustainable by the population. Higher densities in coastal areas make Franciscanas more vulnerable to coastal fishing camps, which increased mortality in recent years. A remarkable finding was that while density decreases to the south, values of catch per unit effort (CPUE) increases, indicating different catchability of dolphins between areas. "
321,4432,"Monitoring of a Southern Giant Petrel Macronectes giganteus population on the Frazier Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica","Since 1956, Southern Giant Petrels on the Frazier Islands, East Antarctica, have been counted with different census techniques, sometimes varying within seasons and among islands, which hindered analysis of the data. Protective measures for the islands from 1986 onwards have increased the need for reliable long-term census data, but reduced the ways to collect these data. Published and unpublished data were re-examined, and population trends were reconstructed based on two relatively standardised techniques: the number of active chicks (AC) and the number of apparently occupied nests (AON) around hatching. AC-values from Nelly Island from 1959 to 1998 indicate substantial periodic fluctuations, but no consistent long-term change. Since the late 1970s, AC-values on the other two islands and AON-values suggest that the breeding population may have grown by 35%. This recent growth, however, is within the extent of periodic fluctuations observed in Southern Giant Petrel population that is stable over the long term."
322,3093,Coastal waterbird population trends in the Strait of Georgia 1999–2011: Results from the first 12 years of the British Columbia Coastal Waterbird Survey,"The British Columbia Coastal Waterbird Survey is a citizen science long-term monitoring program implemented by Bird Studies Canada to assess population trends and ecological needs of waterbirds using the provinces coastal and inshore marine habitats. Standard monthly counts from more than 200 defined sites within the Strait of Georgia were analysed using route-regression techniques to estimate population indices and assess trends in 57 waterbird species over a 12-year period spanning the non-breeding periods from  19992000 to 201011. A power analysis was also conducted to validate the rigor of the survey design. Results indicate that the survey is detecting annual changes of 3% or less for populations of 29 waterbirds of a wide variety of guilds. Thirty-three species showed stable populations or no trend, 22 species showed significantly declining trends, and just three species showed significant increasing trends. We evaluate these results in the context of other long-term monitoring initiatives in the Salish Sea, highlighting specific birds to watch from a conservation perspective. Among those that showed a declining trend were a guild of piscivores, including Western and Horned Grebes, Common, Red-throated and Pacific Loons, and Rhinoceros Auklet; several sea ducks (Black and White-winged Scoters, Long-tailed Duck, Barrows Goldeneye, Harlequin Duck); two shorebirds (Dunlin, Surfbird); and Great Blue Heron. In the stable/no trend group were 20 species for which the Salish Sea is of recognised global or continental conservation importance, including one grebe, two cormorants, eight waterfowl (including five diving ducks), three shorebirds and two gulls. Next steps in the application of the B.C. Coastal Waterbird Survey and related datasets to conservation and research management questions are discussed, underscoring the importance of continued monitoring using this cost-effective approach and expanding the use of these data to hypothesis-testing to investigate factors potentially driving population changes."
323,2779,"The Dalmation pelican, Pelecanus crispus Bruch 1832, a recently world-endangered bird species","The world population of Dalmatian pelicans P. crispus, the largest pelican species of the genus Pelecanus, has decreased drastically since the last centruy. Its breeding range has diminished in relationship to agricultural and industrial development and draining of wetlands, and is now limited to the esstern part of the Old World. The present status of P. crispus is reviewed, and the number of breeding pairs in the world is estimated to be between 700-1100 in 16-24 different breeding sites. Migration and wintering are poorly known. Data on the food (strictly fish), the impact of P. crispus on fisheries and a peculiar feeding behavior of Dalmatian pelicans in distinct association with the great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo are discussed. New contributions on reproduction and predation are presented, and suggestions are made for conservation, monitoring and management."
324,4352,Fish and fisheries of Prespa Lake,"Twenty-three taxa of fish have been identified from the Prespa lakes. Eleven of these have been introduced or translocated, and 7 of the remaining 12 are endemic to the Prespa lakes. This high proportion of endemism requires confirmation because the systematic position of several of the species and subspecies remains uncertain. The absence of a predatory fish in Mikri Prespa, the occurrence of trout in Megali Prespa, the presence of eels in both lakes and the occurrence of many rheophilous fish species typifies the fish communities of these two lakes. Monitoring of the fish population in Mikri Prespa, from 1984 to 1994, showed apparent stability or a slight increase in catches during this period. Not all the introduced species have been able to establish populations and their impact on the indigenous populations is yet to be defined. A spectacular re-establishment of the carp population, following the crash of the stock of this species in the 1970s-1980s, was recorded in the spring of 1991. The past and present situation of the fisheries in lakes Mikri and Megali Prespa is described, and their productivity and yields are analysed. Particular attention is given to a traditional fishing method unique to the Prespa region: ""pelaizia"" fishing. The factors involved in the temporal trends in the fisheries are identified and analysed. Recommendations for the management of the fish populations and the fisheries are proposed, so that the sustainability of this resource and the survival of the endemic fish species can be ensured. "
325,2780,"Electric power lines: a cause of mortality in Pelecanus crispus Bruch, a world endangered bird species, in Porto-Lago, Greece","From October 1985 to March 1987, 28 Dalmatian Pelicans (Pelecanus crispus) were killed by flying into a power line located between their roosting island and their feeding grounds at Porto-Lago in northern Greece, a major wintering ground for this species. Ninety three percent of the dead birds were immatures, sixty nine percent being first year birds. Using band recoveries of birds banded (color plastic engraved bands) in Greece and Bulgaria, as part of an intentional study of the population dynamics of Dalmatian Pelican, we estimated that additional mortality due to the power line would cause a decrease of between 1.3 to 3.5% in the number of breeding pairs of Greece and Bulgaria by the time sexual maturity is reached (3 years old). Since the removal of the power line in November 1986, no dead bird has been found."
326,1478,No evidence of general decline in an amphibian community of Southern France,"We investigated long term changes in an amphibian community in the Languedoc area of Southern France by comparing results of a survey of 56 ponds made in the early 1970s with results of a survey of the same localities in 2001. Based on the frequency of new occurrences and disappearances of species in the sample ponds, there is no sign of a general decline of amphibians in this area. Most species showed non-significant variation in frequency of occurrence or had increased. ""Green frogs"" (Rana perezi/ridibunda/kl. grafi) showed clear signs of decline, but this is a local phenomenon rather than a decline at the regional scale. Pelodytes punctatus probably declined also, possibly due to its sensitivity to fish introduction. The species richness in the ponds has also remained stable except in ponds where fish have been introduced. The only adverse impact of human activities that we could detect was thus the introduction of fish, which had a significantly adverse effect on amphibian species richness. "
327,4,Estimating the quality of Dutch mammal populations.,A study within the framework of the Dutch Natural Capital Index
328,1877,Mass mortality of native anuran tadpoles in tropical Australia due to the invasive cane toad (Bufo marinus),"Specific pathways of the ecological impact of invasive species remain poorly known. Although the spread of toxic cane toads (Bufo marinus) through tropical Australia is widely believed to have caused extensive mortality of native reptiles and mammals, effects of toad ingestion on native anurans have been virtually ignored. our studies on the Adelaide River floodplain show that the most numerous vertebrate victims of toad invasion are native tadpoles that die when they attempt to consume toad eggs. We documented 11 episodes of mass mortality, totalling >1300 tadpoles of 10 species, in five waterbodies within a single wet-season shortly after the toads invaded. A causal link between toad breeding and tadpole mortality is supported by observations that: (1) in at least 9 of the 11 waterbodies involved, toads bred immediately prior to mortality events; (2) water quality was indistinguishable from that of control ponds, and tadpoles placed in that water remained healthy; (3) dead tadpoles showed no sign of disease; and (4) laboratory trials showed rapid, 100% mortality in native tadpoles exposed to freshly-laid toad eggs. Despite these high mortality rates, toad invasion does not appear to threaten the viability of anuran populations because frogs often breed in ponds not used by toads, and because density-dependent growth and survival within tadpole communities mean that additional mortality may not reduce the total effective recruitment of metamorph frogs from a waterbody.

329,1055,"Reproductive-Performance, Recruitment and Survival of Wandering Albatrosses Diomedea-Exulans at Bird-Island, South-Georgia","The wandering albatross breeding population at Bird Island has declined since 1961 at a rate of 1.0% per annum. Similar declines have occurred elsewhere in the Subantarctic. Breeding success (average 64%) has increased by 1.2% per annum, with increases in hatching and fledging success about equally responsible. Breeding frequency has remained constant, except that higher breeding success means more birds breeding biennially. Of successful breeders, 72%, 8% and 6% breed 2, 3 and more years later, respectively; of unsuccessful birds, 68%, 14% and 6% breed 1, 2 and more years later. Recruitment to the breeding population has decreased from 36% (of a cohort) in the 1960s to 30% nowadays; average age of 1st breeding has also decreased. Adult survival averages 94%; females have a 2% significantly lower rate than males; survival in the 1960s was probably 1-2% higher. A demographic model is developed which closely matches the observed changes and gives rates of population decrease of 0.9-1.1% per annum. The causes of the population decrease must operate mainly outside the breeding season. Earlier suggestions that incidental mortality due to fishing activity in lower latitudes is important are strongly reinforced by new data on birds killed during long-line fishing for tuna. Annual mortality rates may exceed 2-3% of Bird Island adults and 15% of juveniles. -from Authors"
330,4358,Reproductive data and analysis of recoveries in a population of white stork Ciconia ciconia in southern Spain: a 24-year study,"Changes in nest density and reproductive success of a free-ranging population of white stork (Ciconia ciconia) in the Gardens of ZooBotánico Jerez (Cádiz) were studied from 1990 to 2013. Reproductive data (number of nests and number of chicks per nest) and the effect of rainfall on the reproductive success were analyzed. In addition, a number of chicks were colour-ringed each year and the recovery data were also analyzed. The number of nests found in the area steadily increased during the study period and varied greatly from year to year from 2001 onwards (mean 19, range = 4-35, N = 22 years). Reproductive success also varied greatly among years. Overall, the mean number of chicks per nest was 1.78 ± 1.2 (range = 0-5, N = 439 nests).Reproductive success was strongly influenced by rainfall. It was highest (1.88) in years classified as rainy, medium (1.62) in years classified as normal, and lowest (1.24) in dry years. A total of 404 white storks were ringed, 110 of which were observed a total of 308 times (2.8 + 2.8 times per bird, range 1-12, all year data pooled). Recovery data show that with one exception, all ringed birds were recorded at different habitats of S Spain throughout the year. Remarkably, none was observed at traditional wintering quarters, south of the Sahara in Africa. Juveniles remained in the area (from July to October) soon after leaving our colony, and virtually all of them disappeared from November to January (their first winter) but were recorded again during their first breeding season. On the contrary, adults were repeatedly recorded at different sites in Cádiz, Sevilla and Huelva all year round. These birds showed a strong philopatry as some of them were recorded as breeders in our colony, up to 11 years after ringing. Our data emphasize the importance of both refuse damp and wetland areas for the species, especially in winter, and a shift in the timing of the reproductive season as birds were recorded from November to July each year. Our study provides evidence of the increase in the population, a significant effect of rainfall on their reproductive success, and the non-migratory habits of adult white storks in our colony. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such long-term reproductive data for a Mediterranean population of white storks is shown."
331,3448,"Using movements and diet analyses to assess effects of introduced muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Saint John River, New Brunswick","The muskellunge was introduced in the Saint John River system from stockings in a headwater lake in the 1970s. They have migrated down the system as far as the rivers first dam, Mactaquac Hydroelectric Facility, at Fredericton and appear to have established several reproducing populations along the river. This exotic invader represents a potential threat to the severely depleted Atlantic salmon stocks in the river. We radio-tracked muskellunge over a 2-year period in the middle reaches. Home ranges extended to ~100 km in both riverine and lacustrine areas, including 78% of individuals translocated upstream of the dam making their way; back through the dam successfully. Downstream of the dam, home ranges were <25 km. No spawning areas were detected. An isotope analyses of diet indicated that the large sub-adults and adults had established the greatest proportion of their biomass in a more 15N depleted  environment typical of areas farther upstream. Isotope mixing models could not accurately determine the proportion of Atlantic salmon smolts that may have been consumed by  muskellunge, but anadromous salmon had £7% probabilities of being in the diet. A bioenergetics model suggested £5% of the annual food intake by muskellunge occurs during the smolt out-migration period. For the Saint John River, the impacts of growing numbers of muskellunge are multi-faceted creating a complex management challenge. Muskellunge appear to minimally increase predation risk for Atlantic salmon smolts while their increasing numbers are; creating a growing recreational fishery and potential threat to the native fish community and ecosystem."
332,4188,"Seasonal Distribution and Historic Trends in Abundance of White Sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, in the Western North Atlantic Ocean","Despite recent advances in field research on white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) in several regions around the world, opportunistic capture and sighting records remain the primary source of information on this species in the northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWA). Previous studies using limited datasets have suggested a precipitous decline in the abundance of white sharks from this region, but considerable uncertainty in these studies warrants additional investigation. This study builds upon previously published data combined with recent unpublished records and presents a synthesis of 649 confirmed white shark records from the NWA compiled over a 210-year period (1800-2010), resulting in the largest white shark dataset yet compiled from this region. These comprehensive records were used to update our understanding of their seasonal distribution, relative abundance trends, habitat use, and fisheries interactions. All life stages were present in continental shelf waters year-round, but median latitude of white shark occurrence varied seasonally. White sharks primarily occurred between Massachusetts and New Jersey during summer and off Florida during winter, with broad distribution along the coast during spring and fall. The majority of fishing gear interactions occurred with rod and reel, longline, and gillnet gears. Historic abundance trends from multiple sources support a significant decline in white shark abundance in the 1970s and 1980s, but there have been apparent increases in abundance since the 1990s when a variety of conservation measures were implemented. Though the white shark's inherent vulnerability to exploitation warrants continued protections, our results suggest a more optimistic outlook for the recovery of this iconic predator in the Atlantic."
333,3943,"Abundance of native fishes, wild-introduced salmonids and escaped farmed rainbow trout in a Patagonian reservoir","The introduction of salmonids in Patagonia has resulted in signi?cant impacts on its lakes, as well as a major impact on streams, in which native ?shes seem to have been displaced almost completely by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Another perspective is that the introduced salmonid species have resulted in wild ?sh populations that sustain an economically important sport ?shery. The wide distribution and high abundance of escaped farmed rainbow trout, and a clear decrease in the abundance of native and successfully introduced salmonid species in Alicura Reservoir were all observed, based on comparison of recent data and data from 1993 to 1995 corresponding to littoral gillnet captures. Thus, both native ?sh and introduced salmonid populations seem to have been drastically reduced in the presence of farmed ?sh escapees. The results of the present study regarding ?sh escapes deserve major consideration when making decisions about ?sh cage culture activities for other Patagonian reservoirs."
334,2605,Population trends and conservation status of the Northern Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes moseleyi at Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island,"Populations of the recently split Northern Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes moseleyi are restricted to Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island in the South Atlantic, and Amsterdam and St Paul in the Indian Ocean. The majority of the population is in the Atlantic (> 80%), but population trends at Tristan da Cunha and Gough are uncertain. Early records indicate ""millions"" of penguins used to occur at Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island. The most recent estimates indicate declines in excess of 90% for both Gough and the main island of Tristan that have occurred over at least 45 and 130 years, respectively. Numbers breeding at Inaccessible and Nightingale islands (TDC) also may have declined since the 1970s, albeit modestly, whereas numbers on Tristan appear stable over the last few decades. Current population estimates are 32,000-65,000 pairs at Gough, 18-27,000 at Inaccessible, 19,500 at Nightingale, and 3,200-4,500 at Tristan. Numbers and trends at Middle Island (TDC) are unknown. Middle Island supported an estimated 100,000 pairs in 1973, and recent observations suggest this colony is being impacted by competition for space with recently recolonising Subantarctic Fur Seals Arctocephalus tropicalis. Past human exploitation and the impact of introduced predators may be responsible for the historical decline in numbers at Tristan, but these factors cannot explain the sharp decrease (since the 1950s) at Gough Island. Overall, declines at Gough, Tristan, Nightingale and Inaccessible islands indicate a three-generation decline of > 50%. Taken in combination with recent decreases in Indian Ocean populations, the Northern Rockhopper Penguins is now categorised as globally 'Endangered'. Determining the causal factors responsible for these recent declines is an urgent priority. "
335,3483,Population trends and breeding success of albatrosses and giant petrels at Gough Island in the face of at-sea and on-land threats,"Several factors threaten populations of albatrosses and giant petrels, including the impact of fisheries bycatch and, at some colonies, predation from introduced mammals. We undertook population monitoring on Gough Island of three albatross species (Tristan albatross Diomedea dabbenena L., sooty albatross Phoebetria fusca Hilsenberg, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross Thalassarche chlororhynchos Gmelin) and southern giant petrels Macronectes giganteus (Gmelin). Over the study period, numbers of the Critically Endangered Tristan albatross decreased at 3.0% a year. Breeding success for this species was low (23%), and in eight count areas was correlated (r2 = 0.808) with rates of population decline, demonstrating chick predation by house mice Mus musculus L. is driving site-specific trends and an overall decline. Numbers of southern giant petrels were stable, contrasting with large increases in this small population since 1979. Significant population declines were not detected for either the Atlantic yellow-nosed or sooty albatross, however, caution should be applied to these results due to the small proportion of the population monitored (sooty albatross) and significant interannual variation in numbers. These trends confirm the Critically Endangered status of the Tristan albatross but further information, including a more accurate estimate of sooty albatross population size, is required before determining island wide and global population trends of the remaining species."
336,2257,Advances in laying date and increasing population size suggest positive responses to climate change in Common Eiders Somateria mollissima in Iceland,"Models of climate change predict that its effects on animal populations will not always be negative, but most studies indicate negative associations between changes in climate and the phenology of animal migration and reproduction. For some populations, however, climate change may render particular environments more favourable, with positive effects on population growth. We used a 30-year population dataset on over 2000 Common Eiders Somateria mollissima at a colony in southwest Iceland to examine the response of this species to climate fluctuations. Eiders are strongly dependent on suitable climatic conditions for successful reproduction and survival. Temperatures in southwest Iceland, in both winter and summer, have generally increased over the past 30 years but have shown considerable fluctuation. We show that females laid earlier following mild winters and that year-to-year variation in the number of nests was related to the temperature during the breeding season 2 years previously. Milder summers could have positive effects on breeding success and offspring survival, producing an increase in nest numbers 2 years later when most Eiders recruit into the breeding population. In this part of their range, Eiders could benefit from a general warming of the climate. "

338,3635,"An introduction to the herpetofauna of Antigua, Barbuda and Redonda, with some conservation recommendations","At least 29 reptiles and amphibians have been documented on Antigua, Barbuda and Redonda, of which 21 are probably native. These include four species of marine turtles, two of which (Eretmochelys imbricata and Chelonia mydas) are known to nest on the nation's numerous sandy beaches and forage in nearshore waters. The low-lying and largely sedimentary islands of Antigua (280 km2) and Barbuda (161 km2) formed a single island as recently as 12,000 years ago and exhibit a similar herpetofauna with high endemicity. At least four terrestrial species are endemic to the Antigua and Barbuda bank: Alsophis antiguae, Ameiva griswoldi, Anolis wattsi, Sphaerodactylus elegantulus (a possible fifth being Barbuda's Anolis forresti, if not synonymous with A. wattsi), and a further five are Lesser Antillean endemics. Only six species have been documented on the small, rugged volcanic island of Redonda (1 km2), but as many as half of them occur nowhere else (Ameiva atrata, Anolis nubilus, and a potentially new Sphaerodactylus sp.). Centuries of forest clearance, overgrazing and development, coupled with the introduction of small Asian mongooses (Herpestes javanicus), black rats (Rattus rattus) and other alien invasive species, has endangered many of the nation's wildlife, and at least four indigenous reptiles have been extirpated (Boa constrictor, Clelia clelia, Iguana delicatissima, and Leiocephalus cuneus). Recent moves to enlarge the nation's protected area network are encouraging, but need to be supported with stronger legislation and proper investment in management staff and resources. This paper presents conservation recommendations and describes two projects that have adopted innovative approaches to save the most critically endangered reptiles - the Jumby Bay Hawksbill Project and the Antiguan Racer Conservation Project."
339,1401,Variability of fish densities in a small catchment,"Temporal and spatial variability of fish communities were examined within a 91-km2 catchment in central New York over four years. Riffle-dwelling species, slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus, longnose dace Rhinichthys cataractae, and young-of-the-year brown trout Salmo trutta, were more strongly affected by flood and drought than pool-adapted species, adult brown trout, blacknose dace Rhinichthys atratulus, white sucker Catostomus commersoni, and creek chub Semotilus atromacitlatiis. Canonical correspondence analysis using seven abiotic variables (mean width, residual pool depth, water surface slope, mean Froude number, variance in Froude number, maximum monthly discharge and minimum monthly discharge) separated fish communities among sites and years. The first axis represented a headwater-to-valley gradient; the second axis reflected habitat complexity, based on both geomorphic and hydraulic features. Temporal differences in fish densities were related to hydrological factors. Fish communities throughout the catchment showed similar responses to flood and drought. "
340,4126,A bat on the brink? A range-wide survey of the Critically Endangered Livingstone's fruit bat Pteropus livingstonii,"The Livingstone's fruit bat Pteropus livingstonii is endemic to the small islands of Anjouan and Mohéli in the Comoros archipelago, Indian Ocean. The species is under threat from anthropogenic pressure on the little that remains of its forest habitat, now restricted to the islands' upper elevations and steepest slopes. We report the results of the most comprehensive survey of this species to date, and present recommendations for ongoing field conservation efforts and monitoring. Morning counts were conducted at roost sites in the wet and dry seasons during 2011-2013. Habitat structure around the roosting sites was characterized and roost numbers compared, to investigate the potential effect of habitat loss and degradation. We estimate the population to comprise c. 1,260 individuals distributed across 21 roosts on the two islands. All occupied roosting sites were restricted to a narrow altitudinal range, and roosting populations in agroforestry areas were smaller than those found in degraded and undisturbed forest. Only one of the 16 roosts on Anjouan was found in undisturbed, old-growth forest with no nearby signs of clearance for agriculture or landslides following tree-felling upslope. Following a suspected severe population decline as a result of widespread and long-term forest loss Livingstone's fruit bat has been recategorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List."
341,2886,"Distribution and abundance of seabirds in Western Port, Victoria","The distribution, abundance and biomass of seabirds in Western Port, Victoria, were surveyed between April 1991 and August 1994. Individuals were counted along an 81-km series of transects from a boat at approximately monthly intervals. A total of 25 seabird taxa were recorded, of which 18 and 15 were common to those recorded by an earlier study in Port Phillip Bay and waters south of Phillip Island, respectively. The most numerous species by far was the Short-tailed Shearwater (Puffinus tenuirostris) followed by the Silver Gull (Larus novaehollandiae). Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) and Crested Tern (Sterna bergii). Distribution within Western Port was not uniform, with pursuit divers such as cormorant and grebe species being recorded mostly in the shallow Eastern Arm. In contrast, surface-seizing (e.g. albatrosses), surface-plunging (e.g. Crested Terns), shallow-plunging (Australasian Gannet, Morus serrator) and pursuit-plunging (e.g. shearwaters) species predominated in the deeper Western Arm of Western Port. These species were also seasonally abundant, with peak numbers for most occurring in late summer-early autumn, which coincides with the reported influx of juvenile clupeoid fish into Western Port. Average biomass (686 ± 395 kg) comprised mostly Short-tailed Shearwaters, Little Penguins and Pied Cormorants (Phalacrocorax varius). Biomass density (8.5 kg km-2) was similar to that reported for Port Phillip Bay (8.1 kg km-2) but lower than off the southern coast of Phillip Island (9.9 kg km-2)."
342,3842,Elephant population trends and associated factors: a review of the situation in western Ghana,"The Ankasa and Bia Conservation Areas and the Goaso Forest Block form a significant portion of forest elephant range in western Ghana. This paper reviews historical and recent information on elephant population trends in western Ghana and the factors associated with these trends. We used two methods: 1) monitoring trends in elephant populations using density estimates, and 2) tracking changes in elephant distribution and density due to poaching activity. Our results indicate that most elephant populations have declined in western Ghana, although a few seem to have persisted. Specifically, we recorded positive trends in two protected areas, Ankasa and Bia, where elephants seem to be recovering under good management practices, such as reduced hunting pressure and habitat management. The Goaso elephant populations have suffered major declines in both numbers and range. Currently, elephant range is confined to only a few of the reserves in the northern Goaso Forest Block. These declines were probably as a consequence of accelerated immigration of farmers into Ghanas western region in the 1990s, resulting in increased hunting activity and habitat loss due to unregulated timber extraction and agriculture. We also show that effective elephant range is negatively affected by poaching activity, and that elephants currently do not move across the GhanaCote dIvoire boundary."
343,3798,Ecological legacies of civil war: 35-year increase in savanna tree cover following wholesale large-mammal declines,"1. Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) exert strong effects on plants in tropical savannas, and many wild LMH populations are declining. However, predicting the impacts of these declines on vegetation structure remains challenging. 2. Experiments suggest that tree cover can increase rapidly following LMH exclusion. Yet it is unclear whether these results scale up to predict ecosystem-level impacts of LMH declines, which often alter fire regimes, trigger compensatory responses of other herbivores and accompany anthropogenic land-use changes. Moreover, theory predicts that grazers and browsers should have opposing effects on tree cover, further complicating efforts to forecast the outcomes of community-wide declines. 3. We used the near-extirpation of grazing and browsing LMH from Gorongosa National Park during the Mozambican Civil War (19771992) as a natural experiment to test whether megafaunal collapse increased tree cover. We classified herbaceous and tree cover in satellite images taken (a) at the onset of war in 1977 and (b) in 2012, two decades after hostilities ceased. 4. Throughout the 3620-km2 park, proportional tree cover increased by 34% (from 0.29 to 0.39)  an addition of 362 km2. Four of the parks five major habitat zones (including miombo woodland, AcaciaCombretumpalm savanna, and floodplain grassland) showed even greater increases in tree cover (51134%), with an average increase of 94% in ecologically critical Rift Valley habitats. Only in the eastern Cheringoma Plateau, which had historically low wildlife densities, did tree cover decrease (by 5%). 5. The most parsimonious explanation for these results is that reduced browsing pressure enhanced tree growth, survival and/or recruitment; we found no directional trends in rainfall or fire that could explain increased tree cover. 6. Synthesis. Catastrophic large-herbivore die-offs in Mozambiques flagship national park were followed by 35 years of woodland expansion, most severely in areas where pre-war wildlife biomass was greatest. These findings suggest that browsing release supersedes grazergrassfire feedbacks in governing ecosystem-level tree cover, consistent with smaller-scale experimental results, although the potentially complementary effect of CO2 fertilization cannot be definitively ruled out. Future work in Gorongosa will reveal whether recovering LMH populations reverse this trend, or alternatively whether woody encroachment hinders ongoing restoration efforts"
344,1509,Importance of pre-recruitment life-history stages to population dynamics of the woolly sculpin Clinocottus analis.,"The relative influence of pre- versus post-recruitment life-history events on population size has been the subject of much recent debate. In the marine realm, much work has focused on intertidal invertebrates and on tropical reef fishes, with mixed results. We addressed this problem for a temperate intertidal fish, Clinocottus analis. Our main goal was to determine which life-history stage was most responsible for temporal changes in population size from 1996 to 2000 at 2 sites in San Diego, California, both seasonally and during the 1997 to 1998 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. We approached the problem using cohort analysis and matrix population modeling. Recruitment pulses were evident in population size structure for up to a year, unobscured by post-recruitment mortality, which was not density-dependent. Recruitment was not correlated to spawning adult biomass of 3 mo earlier, suggesting that egg, larval, or early post-settlement processes during those 3 mo determined the magnitude of recruitment, and ultimately, population size. Stage-structured population projection matrices were constructed to compare population growth rates and sensitivities among seasons and between climate periods (El Niño and non-El Niño). Elasticity (prospective) and decomposition (retrospective) analyses of these matrices indicated that the vital rates to which population growth rate (λ) was theoretically most sensitive were not necessarily those responsible for observed temporal differences in λ. Although λ was most sensitive to juvenile growth and adult survivorship, fertility (which in this model included fecundity and egg, larval, and early post-settlement survivorship), in addition to juvenile growth, drove observed seasonal differences in λ. C. analis population size decreased during the 1997 to 1998 El Ninõ event due to a decrease in recruitment, a decrease in batch fecundity (hydrated eggs per female) and, at 1 site, changes in juvenile survivorship. Results of the study emphasize the power of early life-history events to structure C. analis populations on both seasonal and longer timescales."
345,1388,Effects of gill-net fishing on marine birds in a biological hotspot in the Northwest Atlantic,"Marine biological hotspots, or areas where high abundances of species overlap in space and time, are ecologically important areas because energy flow through marine food webs, a key ecosystem process, is maximized in these areas. I investigated whether top predators aggregated at persistent spawning sites of a key forage fish species, capelin (Mallotus villosus), on the NE coast of Newfoundland during July and August 2000-2003. By examining the distributional patterns of top predators through ship-based surveys at multiple spatial and temporal scales, I found that the biomasses of birds - dominated by Common Murres (Uria aalge) - and mammals - dominated by whale species - were concentrated along the coast, with a biological hotspot forming near two persistent spawning sites of capelin in all years. The formation of this hotspot was well defined in space and time from middle of July to middle of August, likely coinciding with the spawning chronology of capelin. Within this hotspot, there was a high spatial and temporal overlap of Common Murres and gill nets set to capture Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). This resulted in breeding murres becoming entangled in gill nets while feeding on spawning capelin. Despite an acknowledged uncertainty of bycatch mortality, estimates for the larger regional-scale area (1936-4973 murres/year; 0.2-0.6% of the breeding population) underestimated mortality relative to estimates within the hotspot (3053-14054 murres/year; 0.4-1.7%). Although fishing effort for Atlantic cod has declined substantially since the groundfish moratorium in 1992, chronic, unnatural, and additive mortality through bycatch continues in coastal Newfoundland. Restricted use of gill nets within this and other biological hotspots during the capelin spawning period appears to be a straightforward application of the ""ecological and biologically significant area"" management framework in Canada's Oceans Act. This protection would minimize murre bycatch and maintain ecosystem integrity. "
346,3119,Interactions with Great Skuas Stercorarius skua as a factor in the long-term decline of an Arctic Skua Stercorarius parasiticus population,"Many of the UK's seabird species have displayed high variation in breeding success since the 1980s, largely due to changes in the availability of Lesser Sandeels Ammodytes marinus, their main prey. During this time, Arctic Skuas Stercorarius parasiticus experienced a rapid decline in the UK and the species has subsequently been placed on the Red List of birds of conservation concern. Although shortage of Lesser Sandeels is likely to be an influential factor, the Arctic Skua's breeding range overlaps with that of the Great Skua Stercorarius skua, a larger bird with a more varied diet, and interspecific interactions for nesting habitat may exert an additional pressure on Arctic Skua breeding populations. Results from four censuses, spanning 21 years, were used to model habitat use and analyse distributional change in nesting Arctic Skuas at a major colony located on Fetlar, Shetland, Scotland. The decline in Arctic Skuas was not uniform across the island and competition with Great Skuas for nest-sites appears to have influenced localized breeding distribution. By 2006, Arctic Skuas had been almost entirely excluded from shrub heath, blanket bog and coastal heath habitats, which were identified as preferred habitat in 1986. In 2006, Arctic Skua breeding territories were mainly restricted to one core area of preferred habitat where over 90% nested in high density as this habitat became increasingly occupied by Great Skuas. The more generalist foraging habit of the Great Skua allowed the population to grow rapidly as numbers of the more specialist Arctic Skua decreased during times of low sandeel availability. Our model suggests that both interspecific competition for territories with Great Skuas and food limitation have played important roles in the decline of Arctic Skuas on Fetlar. "
347,4583,Population ecology and seasonal demography of the endangered grotto sculpin (Cottus specus),"Subterranean fishes are understudied worldwide and often at risk before their populations are discovered and described. The nature of karst systems limits the applicability of ecological paradigms and hinders our ability to identify and preserve endemic fauna. Aquatic karst taxa in particular are subject to environmental threats that increase in severity over time. Once a population or species is recognised as distinct, it is imperative we gain understanding of its biology to inform effective resource management and mitigate risk factors. The grotto sculpin (Cottus specus) is endemic to Perry County, Missouri, U.S. caves and was formally described and listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2013. We used markrecapture methods to quantify population densities and estimate population sizes in two caves and two corresponding spring branches. Size structure varied among habitats and seasons. Spring branches were dominated by juveniles year-round with peak young-of-year (YOY) densities in May. Adult densities in both macrohabitats decreased in winter, possibly due to recruitment or seasonal stress, and were lower at spring branches compared to caves and declined further during late winter which may be indicative of cave spawning. YOY were captured variably underground with peak densities in summer. The ecology of grotto sculpin appears to be more complex than has been reported previously for subterranean fishes. Variable patterns of demography requiring multiple contiguous habitats are unique for cave species and support the recently substantiated suggestion that subterranean systems are not as simple or disconnected as once thought."
348,3956,"Population ecology of small rodents and marsupials in a semi-deciduous tropical forest of the southeast Pantanal, Brazil","The Pantanal is a South American biome characterized by extensive plains and stark environmental seasonality. Several habitats are subject to annual flooding, forcing small mammal species to aggregate in dry forest patches, which most likely influences their population dynamics and life history strategies. In order to investigate the seasonal influence on the life history traits of these small mammals, we conducted a 2-year mark-recapture study in the southeastern region of the Brazilian Pantanal (Nhecolândia) and analyzed the population dynamics of the most abundant small mammal species with the jackknife estimator. A trapping effort of 21,560 trap-nights resulted in 615 individuals in 1,171 captures (success = 5.43%). Three species of rodents - Oecomys mamorae (Thomas, 1906), Thrichomys pachyurus (Wagner, 1845), and Clyomys laticeps (Thomas, 1841) - and three species of marsupials - Gracilinanus agilis (Burmeister, 1854), Thylamys macrurus (Olfers, 1818), and Monodelphis domestica (Wagner, 1842) - were obtained. The most abundant species was O. mamorae, followed by G. agilis and T. pachyurus. Oecomys mamorae was more abundant in the wet season and presented an opportunistic reproductive strategy. Gracilianus agilis displayed increased population sizes in the dry season and synchronized, seasonal reproduction during the rainy season. Thrichomys pachyurus had a small population size, delayed response to variations in environmental conditions and higher reproductive rates in the dry season. All species revealed different life history strategies (seasonal, opportunistic or delayed response to environmental variations), coinciding with periods of higher resource availability in order to maximize survival.

349,3919,"Population structure and reproduction of a migratory fish Leporinus piau (Characiformes: Anostomidae) in a semiarid tropical reservoir, Brazil","Migratory fishes have been seriously impacted by the building of reservoirs and because of the negative effects of these projects such as the interruption of migratory routes, reduction or elimination of spawning/ feeding areas, and initial development can influence the population structure the migratory fishes, resulting in reduction in abundance. Leporinus piau is migratory fish widely distributed in the watersheds of the Brazilian semiarid and it is of importance for artisanal and sport fishing. The goal of the study was to evaluate the population structure and reproductive dynamics of the migratory species Leporinus piau in the Pau dos Ferros Reservoir, which is located in the semiarid region of Brazil. The CPUE, length structure, length-weight relationship, length at first maturity, sex ratio, gonad development and IGS were analyzed. Collections were performed quarterly between February 2011 and November 2012 using gillnets. The captured fish were counted; the standard length (cm) and total weight (g) were measured, and dissected to determine the sex and gonad maturity stage. The rainfall and reservoir water levels were recorded, and their correlations with the reproductive period and CPUE were analyzed. A total 549 individuals were captured. The average CPUE varied between 0.0259 individuals/m2*h (May/2011) and 0.0008 individuals/m2*h (August/2012), and significant differences were observed; however, significant correlations were not observed between rainfall and reservoir levels. The standard length varied between 5.9 cm and 20.7 cm, and the weight varied between 4.16 g and 271.5 g. A histogram analysis revealed that the 5-10 cm standard length class was the most abundant for juveniles and that the 10-15 cm class was the most abundant for adult females and males. The weight-length relationship was best fit by the equation log10Wt = -1.57711 + 3.00707 Log10 Ls, and the species presented isometric growth. The estimated length at first maturity was 12.76 cm. A total of 148 males and 82 females were collected (1.81:1, M:F), and these values were significantly different. The highest GSI was observed in February 2011 for both females (10.69) and males (5.72), and the GSI was significantly and positively correlated with rainfall. We concluded that the L. piau population is established in the reservoir and found that its reproduction period occurred during the rainy season between February and May."
350,3944,Mangrove habitat use by fishes in Southeastern Brazil: are there temporal changes in the structure of the community?,"We compared ?sh community structure in Guaratiba Mangrove, SE Brazil, among three seasons of the hydrological cycle [(i) spring, increasing temperature and rainfall, decreasing salinity; (ii) summer/early fall, high temperature and rainfall, intermediate salinity; (iii) late fall/winter, low temperature and rainfall, high salinity] and between the years 20022003 and 20082009. The aim was to test the hypothesis that the ?sh community structure changes seasonally, associated with seasonal changes in environmental conditions, and that changes occurred between the two yearly periods because of increased anthropogenic activities. The sampling protocol for the two surveys was identical. A total of 63 species was recorded, with 38 species occurring in 20022003, and 53 species in 20082009. The main changes in the mangroves ?sh assemblage between 20022003 and 20082009 were (i) an increase in species richness, ?sh density and total biomass; and (ii) an increase in the zoobenthivorous species of gerreids Eucinostomus argenteus, Diapterus rhombeus and Ulaema lefroyi, and a decrease in the planktivorous clupeid Harengula clupeola. Other abundant species, such as the opportunistic atherinopsid. Atherinella brasiliensis, the detritivorous mullet Mugil liza and the zoobenthivorous puffer?sh Sphoeroides testudineus did not differ in abundance between the two yearly periods. Ten species occurred only in 20022003, and 23 species only in 20082009, indicating signi?cant changes in community structure over the 6-year period. Seasonal changes in community structure were more conspicuous in 20082009, when species abundance and richness were greatest. The highest ?sh abundance was recorded in spring and in summer/early fall, and the lowest in late fall/winter. The increased abundance and richness over time may be at least partially attributable to protection policies because of the effective implementation of a biological reserve in the area."
351,3945,Effects of climate and food availability on four rodent species in Southeastern Brazil,"Seasonal reproduction of small mammals in the tropics usually is related to annual cycles of rainfall. We examined effects of weather and food availability on reproduction and population ecology of Nectomys squamipes, Oryzomys intermedius, Akodon cursor and Trinomys iheringi. Each species was studied monthly from February 1993 to January 1995 using mark-recapture methods at Ilha do Cardoso, São Paulo State, Brazil. Average capture rate for each month was used as an index of population size, and survival rate was estimated by the Jolly-Seber method. Direct effects of food availability and rainfall were related to female reproductive activity and survival rate. Path analyses were used to describe quantitatively the hypothesized causal relations among the variables. N. squamipes reproduced seasonally, and O. intermedius, T. iheringi, and A. cursor reproduced all year with peaks during the rainy season. Species responded differently to the environmental factors; however, food availability seems to be the main factor determining reproduction. Abundance of rains appears to diminish survival rate of O. intermedius. Survival rate of N. squamipes increases with increases in fruit availability."

353,3962,"Diurnal raptors in Los Tuxtlas biosphere reserve, Mexico: current presence and relative abundance","Little is known about the current status of raptor populations in tropical Mexico. From 2008 to; 2010 we studied resident diurnal raptors in the region of Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz. We surveyed forest habitats; with different levels of conservation to confirm current raptor presence and to measure relative abundance.; We found only 18 of the 24 species of resident raptors reported in the literature still present. Of the family; Accipitridae, Gray-lined Hawk (Buteo nitidus) was the most abundant species, with an average rate of 0.20; individuals/km covered. Of the Falconidae, Crested Caracara (Caracara cheriway) was the most abundant,; with 0.09 individuals/km. Species associated with forest habitats such as White Hawk (Pseudastur albicollis),; Ornate Hawk-Eagle (Spizaetus ornatus), Black Hawk-Eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), and Barred Forest-Falcon; (Micrastur ruficollis) were observed infrequently, and exclusively in well preserved fragments of tropical; rainforest and cloud forest. We believe that the main causes of the absence of six raptor species and the low; abundance of many others were habitat loss, forest fragmentation, and poaching, although some species; are difficult to detect and could have been missed by the methodology employed. We propose monitoring; of indicator species, ecotourism, environmental education, and habitat restoration, especially in the lowlands,; as key techniques for the long-term conservation of this raptor assemblage."
354,2412,"The fishery, growth rates and notes on reproduction of the snakehead Channa striata (Bloch) (Perciformes: Channidae) in some irrigation reservoirs of Sri Lanka","The fishery for snakehead (Channa striata) in Sri Lanka was studied by monitoring the monthly catch from a large reservoir of 972 ha surface area and that of five closely situated smaller reservoirs of surface areas ranging from 37 to 265 ha for 18 months. The annual snakehead yield in the large reservoir was 1.76 kg ha-1 while that of smaller reservoirs was 7.08 kg ha-1. In all reservoirs, snakehead was only a by-catch of the tilapia fishery. The total annual C. striata yield in Sri Lanka is estimated to be over 317 t which is only about 0.8% of the total reservoir fish production. The growth parameters asymptotic length (L- infin ) and growth constant (K) of the snakehead populations, as determined by monthly size-frequency data, were respectively 60 cm total length and 0.40 for the large reservoir and 53 cm total length and 0.35 for the smaller reservoirs. The mean length of the ten largest individuals (L-max), the mean length of the ten smallest individuals (L-min), mean length at recruitment to the fishery (L' ) and mean size at first capture (L-c) of the two populations were respectively 51.6 cm, 26.6 cm, 37.5 cm, 42.5 cm for the large reservoir and 46.4 cm, 2.2 cm, 36.0 cm and 35.4 cm for the smaller reservoirs. The respective total, natural and Fishing mortalities of the populations were 1.53, 0.84 and 0.69 in the large reservoir and 1.19, 0.77 and 0.42 in the smaller reservoirs. In all reservoirs, over 90% of the catch consisted of third and fourth year fish. Spawning was observed in all months, but it was much more enhanced during and immediately following the major rainy season."
355,3029,"Characteristics of a manta ray Manta alfredi population off Maui, Hawaii, and implications for management","Late maturity, few offspring and a residential nature are typical characteristics of Manta alfredi that make this species vulnerable to localized anthropogenic threats. Improving its life history information is crucial for successful management. A total of 229 surveys was conducted from 2005 to 2009 at a manta ray aggregation site off Maui, Hawaii, to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the abundance, movements and temporal habits of this population. Photo-identifications revealed 290 unique individuals, but a discovery curve showed no asymptotic trend, indicating that the number of individuals using the area was much larger. Resightings and manta ray follows revealed that this population and a population off the Big Island may be independent, island-associated stocks. High resighting rates within and across years provided strong evidence of site fidelity. Findings were consistent; with a population of manta rays moving into and out of the Maui aggregation area, with a varying portion of the total population temporarily resident at any given time. Males, accounting for 53% of all individuals, resided for shorter periods than females around the study area. Manta rays were usually absent at first light with numbers increasing throughout the day. More frequent mating trains were observed during the winter months. Shark predation was evident in 33% of individuals, and 10% had an amputated or non-functional cephalic fin. This small, demographically independent population appears vulnerable to the impacts from non-target fisheries, primarily from entanglement in fishing line, and could suffer from exploitation by commercial, unregulated swim-with manta ray programs. Management on an island-area basis is recommended."
356,2537,A note on amphibian decline in a central Amazonian lowland forest,"The massive reductions in amphibian populations taking place across the globe are unprecedented in modern times. Within the Neotropics, the enigmatic decline of amphibians has been considered predominantly a montane phenomenon; however, recent evidence suggests amphibian and reptile populations in lowland forests in Central America are waning as well. Unfortunately, very little baseline data are available for conducting large scale time series studies in order to further investigate and confirm declines in the lowland forests of tropical America. Here we compare leaf litter herpetofauna abundance at sites in the Central Amazon, sampled first in 1984-1985 and again in 2007. We find no evidence for a decline in abundance or biomass of amphibians over a period of 22 years at this site. This conclusion differs markedly from the decline of 75% in amphibian populations over 35 years at a lowland site in Costa Rica. To explore potential declines in lowland Neotropical amphibian populations in detail, we suggest that existing baseline data be comprehensively compiled and analyzed for previously sampled sites and that these sites be re-sampled using comparable methodologies.

357,3629,"Abundance and distribution of fish in the lower Mnembo River, Malawi-Mozambique","Endorheic Lake Chilwa is one of the most productive lakes for fisheries in Africa. High human population densities and agricultural practices in the Chilwa catchment have been linked to observed declines of the annual fish catch in the lake. The Mnembo River is a major inflow into Lake Chilwa which has received little scientific study to date. In 2003/2004, fish diversity, abundance and distribution were monitored monthly at three sites in the Mnembo River. Twelve fish species were collected, a subset of the fourteen fish species present in Lake Chilwa. Although Barbus spp. were the most abundant species sampled in the Mnembo, total biomass was higher for Labeo cylindricus (6709 and 10,434 g, respectively). Total biomass of Pareutropius longifilis (1741 g) and Brycinus imberi (1174 g) were also high in the river. Catches of Barbus and Labeo were highly correlated (r = 0.763). Compared with other inflows into Lake Chilwa (Likangala and Domasi), the Mnembo River appears to be less adversely influenced by human populations, with high abundance of Barbus and strong presence of the riverine species Labeo, Pareutropius and Brycinus.

358,3537,Monitoring design for quantification of marine turtle nesting with limited effort: a test case in the Guadeloupe archipelago.,"The Guadeloupe archipelago hosts nesting of the threatened hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata, green Chelonia mydas and leatherback Dermochelys coriacea marine turtles. There is a need to monitor the nesting of these species but, with > 150 beaches in the archipelago, exhaustive monitoring is infeasible. Using a new monitoring design and a new statistical tool we have been able to monitor one-third of the beaches. Seasonality and level of nesting were described for the three species for 2 years on > 50 beaches. For each species beaches were categorized as A- or B-beaches, with high and low nest density, respectively. A-beaches were monitored on 6-7 days per month before and after the peak nesting period and on 7-15 days during the peak, and the B-beaches on 14-22 days during the peak. The monitoring design and statistical tool are described in detail as they could be applied to any migratory species. Hawksbill turtles at Trois Ilets beach have been monitored for 9 years and a positive trend in nesting has been detected. "
359,4444,Spatial Models of Abundance and Habitat Preferences of Commerson’s and Peale’s Dolphin in Southern Patagonian Waters,"Commersons dolphins (Cephalorhynchus c. commersonii) and Peales dolphins (Lagenorhynchus australis) are two of the most common species of cetaceans in the coastal waters of southwest South Atlantic Ocean. Both species are listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN, mainly due to the lack of information about population sizes and trends. The goal of this study was to build spatially explicit models for the abundance of both species in relation to environmental variables using data collected during eight scientific cruises along the Patagonian shelf. Spatial models were constructed using generalized additive models. In total, 88 schools (212 individuals) of Commersons dolphin and 134 schools (465 individuals) of Peales dolphin were recorded in 8,535 km surveyed. Commersons dolphin was found less than 60 km from shore; whereas Peales dolphins occurred over a wider range of distances from the coast, the number of animals sighted usually being larger near or far from the coast. Fitted models indicate overall abundances of approximately 22,000 Commersons dolphins and 20,000 Peales dolphins in the total area studied. This work provides the first large-scale abundance estimate for Peales dolphin in the Atlantic Ocean and an update of population size for Commersons dolphin. Additionally, our results contribute to baseline data on suitable habitat conditions for both species in southern Patagonia, which is essential for the implementation of adequate conservation measures."
360,1768,Population trends in a community of large Procellariiforms of Indian Ocean: Potential effects of environment and fisheries interactions,"Despite the worrying conservation status of several albatross and petrel population, the long-term trends of many populations remain largely unknown and the causes of decline in many cases are known or very strongly suspected to be incidental mortality in fisheries. Here we combine long-term monitoring of population trends, breeding success and band recoveries to examine the past and current status of five species of albatrosses and giant petrels breeding at the same site: sooty albatross (Phoebetria fusca), light-mantled albatross (Phoebetria palpebrata), wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans), northern giant (Macronectes halli) and southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) on Possession Island, Crozet archipelago. We identified three groups of trends over a 25-years period (1980-2005) suggesting common underlying causes for these species in relation to their bioclimatic foraging ranges. The Antarctic species - light-mantled albatross and southern giant petrel - appeared stable and increased recently, the Sub-Antarctic species - wandering albatross and northern giant petrel - declined with intermediate periods of increase, and finally the subtropical species - sooty albatross - declined all over the period. Breeding success, indicative of environmental conditions, showed two kinds of pattern (low and fluctuating versus high and/or increasing) which were consistent with oceanographic variations as found in a previous study. We present the analysis of fisheries-related recoveries, indicative of fisheries bycatch risks showing specific catch rates. No direct relationship between population trends and longline fishing effort was detected, probably because census data alone are not sufficient to capture the potentially complex response of demographic parameters of different life stages to environmental variation. This study highlights the contrasted changes of procellariiform species and the particularly worrying status of the subtropical sooty albatrosses, and in a lesser extent of Sub-Antarctic species. "
361,4127,"Population dynamics and diet of the Madamango Sea catfish Cathorops spixii (Agassiz, 1829) (Siluriformes: Ariidae) in a tropical bight in Southeastern Brazil","The madamango sea catfish, Cathorops spixii (Siluriformes: Ariidae), is often among the most abundant fishes on the South American Atlantic coast. In the present study, conducted in shallow, non-estuarine coastal areas of Caraguatatuba Bight in southeastern Brazil, collections of this species, the most abundant member of the ichthyofauna, included primarily medium-sized individuals, indicating that the area may play a specific role in their development. Although studies of the local ichthyofauna have been much neglected, the area is economically important and its ecological significance is undervalued. This study primarily treats habitat use by C. spixii, assessing certain population parameters and the dietary composition. Monthly samples were taken from August 2003 through October 2004, with three trawls in two areas, corresponding to depths of about 1 to 4 m. The catfish showed two main peaks of abundance in the area, in April/May and July 2004. A mode around 9 cm SL persisted through time, and the entrance of younger recruits peaked from January to April. The low estimate for body-growth parameters (K = 0.16) corroborates some K-strategist characteristics of the species. The asymptotic length was 27.3 cm SL and total mortality (Z) was 1.01 yr(-1). Cathorops spixii showed an omnivorous feeding habit, preying mainly upon polychaetes, copepods and bivalves, with considerable seasonality in its diet."
362,3783,"Urban life of Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) on San Cristobal Island, Ecuador: colony trends and threats"," Worldwide, pristine environments are influenced by human societies. In the Galapagos Islands, the endangered, endemic Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) has formed one of the biggest colonies within the town center of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno. About 8,000 people live there and human wildlife interactions occur daily. With colony counts and direct observations from 2008 to 2012, we analyze cause of death, injuries and disease of urban sea lion colonies at Wreck Bay. Population increase since 2008 can be attributed to an immigration of adult sea lions in 2010, resulting in an increase in the pup and juvenile production in 2011 and 2012. Pup mortality increased drastically to 2009 and again in 2011 and 2012. Besides pup mortality, most of the deaths are caused by increased disease incidences and human activity. Our observations suggest that overall 65% of the injuries observed are produced by human interaction. The increase in threats leading to death, injuries or disease can have long-term effects on the population. Although threats that cause physical injuries can be managed locally, sea lions range movements contributes to the spread of infectious pathogens, which may affect neighbor colonies and potentially have an impact on the survival of the species. Our study reveals the need of stronger efforts towards a more complete understanding of threats and especially disease spread among Galapagos Sea lions in urban environments and the establishment of more effective management measures."
363,2925,Rapid colonisation of snapper Pagrus auratus Sparidae within an offshore island marine reserve after implementation of no-take status,"This study reports the response of snapper Pagrus auratus to the establishment of notake status in a marine reserve around the Poor Knights Islands in northeastern New Zealand. The Poor Knights and 2 reference locations, Cape Brett and the Mokohinau Islands, were sampled biannually for 4 yr using baited underwater video (BUV). Following the implementation of full marine reserve status at the Poor Knights in October 1998, snapper showed significant increases in abundance and biomass relative to fished control locations. This was particularly apparent for large snapper (>270 mm), whose numbers increased rapidly to levels 7.4 times higher in the final survey compared to the initial pre-reserve survey, and total snapper biomass increased by 818%. There was no significant increase in the abundance, biomass or size of snapper at the reference locations over this time. There was a strong seasonal trend in snapper abundance, with higher numbers in autumn (March/April) compared to spring (September/October). The daily batch fecundity was 11 to 18 times higher at the Poor Knights compared to the reference locations. Once fishing ceased in previously partially protected areas, a rapid recovery of snapper ensued, suggesting that partial fishing regulations are ineffective for protecting targeted species. The speed of increase in snapper density resulted from the immigration of adult fish into the reserve, rather than from within-reserve recruitment."
364,3280,Status of the Baltic/Wadden Sea population of the Common eider Somateria m. mollissima,"A dramatic decline in the number of wintering Common Eiders from c.; 800,000 to c. 370,000 occurred in Danish waters between 1990 and 2000.; Denmark represents the second most important wintering area for; Eiders from the Baltic/Wadden Sea flyway, and mid-winter counts sug gest; the total population could have fallen from c.1.2 million individuals in; 1991 to c. 760,000 in 2000, implying major (c.36%) overall declines. However,; although declines of similar magnitude have been detected in breeding; numbers at some sites (eg Saltholm in Denmark), such a dramatic; reduction is not generally evident amongst breeding numbers monitored; throughout the flyway. Five hypotheses are offered to explain this discrepancy,; two of which are considered likely to contribute to the; differences. These relate to shortcomings in our ability to monitor adequately; breeding and wintering numbers in both time and space, as well; as to an unknown buffering effect of non-breeders (which are counted on; the winter quarters, but which do not appear amongst assessments of; breeding abundance). Parameters known to contribute to declines in; population size include low duckling survival caused by viral infections,; mass adult mortality due to Avian Cholera, and reduced adult annual; survival rates due to mass mortality events on the wintering grounds.; The population continues to be a quarry species in Denmark, Sweden,; Norway and Finland.

365,3016,Recovery and status of native and introduced beavers Castor fiber and Castor canadensis in France and neighbouring countries,"1 The Eurasian beaver Castor fiber suffered a drastic reduction in both geographical range and population size, due to human persecution, until the end of the 19th century. After the adoption of protection measures, natural expansion and reintroductions led to the recovery of this species over much of its European range. 2 We review historical events that led to the recovery of beavers in France, and summarize the status of beavers in various river systems. Beaver establishment in France is a story of overall success: several major river systems are presently occupied, so that the species is no longer at risk in France. 3 However, beaver recolonization took place in parallel with increasing human impacts on the environment. In addition to natural limiting factors, anthropogenic factors impeded beaver settlement in many areas. Today, beavers often occupy suboptimal habitats and, as a consequence, come into conflict with human activities. Effective solutions for preventing beaver damage include the restoration of riparian habitats to discourage crop damage and the provision of physical barriers to protect crops. 4 Beaver populations reintroduced into France all originate from the relict Rhône population. However, in recent years, beavers from populations in neighbouring countries have been expanding into north-eastern France. Therefore, our review of beaver origin and distribution in these countries may contribute to the development of appropriate national management strategies and towards important decisions, e.g. the decision to try to keep Rhône beavers genetically isolated, or to allow populations to mix. 5 The recently discovered presence of North American beavers Castor canadensis in three countries surrounding France has raised an important issue. This species may out-compete C. fiber in places where the species come into contact. A programme based on field-trapping sessions and genetic analyses has recently been initiated in some western countries in order to eradicate this non-native species. "
366,3225,"Update to the status of the Red knot Calidris canutus in the western hemisphere, April 2011","There has been a major decline in the population of Red Knots that winters in; Tierra del Fuego from 16,260 in 2009/2010 to 9,850 (aerial count) or 11,200 (ground count); in 2010/2011. Numbers wintering in Surinam, French Guyana and part of N Brazil declined; from 7,575 in February 2005 to 3,660 in January 2011. Apart from an anomalous high count; in 2009, the peak number of knots stopping over in Delaware Bay in May has remained fairly; constant over 2003-2010 at about 14,500. Poor conditions for horseshoe crab spawning; during the May stopover in Delaware Bay in 2008 resulted in only 14% of Red Knots; achieving 180g by 26-28 May, but this figure increased to 31% and 42% in 2009 and 2010; respectively when conditions were better (but not as good as they were in 1998 when 87%; were over 180g). Despite a decade of horseshoe crab harvest restrictions instigated by the; Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, there is still no evidence of recovery of the; horseshoe crab population, either in numbers of spawning females or in all sub-adult age; groups including juveniles. Greater restrictions imposed by New Jersey and Delaware to help; speed recovery have been undermined by concurrent increases in the harvests made in other; states. We discuss the reason for the latest decline in the Tierra del Fuego wintering; population in the context of the apparently better feeding conditions in Delaware Bay during; the 2010 stopover (which were nevertheless much poorer than in 1998)."
367,2678,Assessment of cod in the Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence,"In 2008-2009, the total allowable catch (TAC) was 2,000 t. Landings in 2008 were 1,648 t, 121 t landed from 4Vn in January [long dash] April and 1527 t in the 2008-2009 fishing season up to December 31. In a telephone opinion survey of fishers on the status of the stock, 43% considered abundance in 2008 to be the same as in 2007, 33% considered it to be higher, and 24% considered it to be lower. The 2005-2008 abundance indices from the annual DFO research vessel survey are at the lowest levels observed in the 1971-2008 time series. Mean catch rates in the longline sentinel survey declined each year after 2004 and since 2005 have been at the lowest levels observed in the 1995-2008 time series. The abundance index from the sentinel trawl survey declined in 2005 and has remained below the 2003-2004 level since then. Year-classes produced since the late 1980s have been much weaker than those produced from the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s. The most recent year-classes (2003-2006) are estimated to be the lowest in the time series. Natural mortality in recent years is estimated to be high (about 0.6) and increasing. Predation by seals is considered to be a significant component of natural mortality. At such rates of natural mortality, sustainable exploitation rates must be very low. Stock growth is not likely unless productivity increases well above levels observed in the past decade. The exploitation rate in 2008 is estimated at 6% (fishing mortality of 0.08), a small fraction of natural mortality, but still high and unsustainable given current stock productivity. A conservation limit reference point (LRP) has been established for this stock, based on the spawning stock biomass (SSB) below which the probability of poor recruitment is high. The LRP is estimated to be 80,000 t. SSB is at the lowest level observed in the last 60 years. The estimate of SSB at the beginning of 2009 is 28,000 t, which is well below the LRP. SSB has been below the LRP since 2002. SSB is well below the LRP. The application of the precautionary approach would require catches in 2009 to be at the lowest possible level. This would include no directed fishing and measures to reduce cod by-catch in other fisheries. Catches not exceeding 300 t are considered to be a low attainable catch level. Given the high natural mortality and low recruitment in recent years, SSB is expected to decline in 2009 even with no catch, and there is a high probability (about 95%) of a decline of 5% or more. The probability of a decline of 10% or more is 54%."

Growth rate was positively; affected by the cumulative amount of rainfall three months before the normal; breeding season, but not during it. Female breeding activity and recruitment; did not differ among plots, and was not affected by density or rainfall.; However, recruitment was positively affected by density and, marginally, by; rainfall. Our results suggest that intraspecific competition (densitydependence); and food availability (rainfall) are equally important factors; driving wood mouse population dynamics in Mediterranean forests. Mechanisms; underlying density-dependence during the breeding season seemed to; be based on food-mediated survival rather than on behaviourally-mediated; reproduction. Taken together, these results indicate a high sensitivity of; marginal Mediterranean wood mouse populations to the expected climate; changes in the Mediterranean region."
369,4150,"White sharks Carcharodon carcharias at Bird Island, Algoa Bay, South Africa","We present the first quantitative study of the occurrence, size and sex of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias at Bird Island, Algoa Bay. Twenty-two boat trips were made to Bird Island between November 2009 and October 2011 to chum for sharks. A total of 53 sharks was observed over the study period, ranging in size from 1.5 to 4.5 m total length (TL) and with the majority (60.3%) being <3 m TL. The sex ratio of sharks for which sex could be determined was not significantly different from unity. In both study years, sharks were present only in the winter between April and November with a maximum of 1.2 sharks sighted per hour. A zero-altered model, comprising a logistic regression to model presence/absence and a log-normal generalised linear model for abundance, showed that season explained the presence of sharks, peaking in mid-July, with abundance being significantly higher with higher barometric pressure. This study identified Bird Island as an important white shark aggregation site on the east coast of South Africa. These data are crucial not only to improve our understanding of white shark seasonal distribution and biology, but also for the long-term management and conservation of the species in South Africa. "
370,4520,Population dynamics of two species of dragon lizards in arid Australia: the effects of rainfall,"The population dynamics of two species of; agamid (dragon) lizards were studied in the Simpson; Desert, central Australia, over a period of 7 years, and; modelled in relation to rainfall. Both species have annual life cycles, with adults predominating during the; breeding season in spring and summer and juveniles; predominating in other seasons. Within years, juvenile; abundance in both species in autumn and winter was; related most strongly to rainfall in the preceding summer; and autumn. This pattern suggests that rainfall enhances; survival, growth and possibly clutch size and hatching; success. Between years, however, rainfall drove successional change in the dominant plant species in the study; area, spinifex Triodia basedowii, causing in turn a shift in; the relative abundance of the two species. Thus, the; central netted dragon Ctenophorus nuchalis was most; numerous in 1990 when vegetation cover was <10%,; but declined dramatically in abundance after heavy; rainfall at the end of that year. In contrast, the military; dragon C. isolepis achieved greatest abundance following heavy rains in the summers of 1990 and 1994, when; spinifex cover increased to >20%, and remained numerically dominant for much of the study. We suggest; that drought-wet cycles periodically reverse the dominance of the two species of Ctenophorus, and perhaps of; other lizard species also, thus enhancing local species; diversity over time. Further long-term studies are needed; to document the population dynamics of other species,; and to identify the factors that in¯uence them."
371,1545,"Habitat effect on hawksbill turtle growth rates on feeding grounds at Mona and Monito Islands, Puerto Rico","Carapace length growth data were obtained from 197 hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata which were marked and recaptured from 1992 to 2000 at feeding grounds of Mona and Monito Islands, Puerto Rico. Straight-line carapace length (SCL) upon initial capture ranged from 20.0 to 84.5 cm. SCL growth rates ranged from -0.59 to 9.08 cm yr-1, were non-monotonic, and averaged highest in turtles measuring 34 to 35 cm. Somatic growth rates varied by site within the study area, with turtles from the aggregation at Monito Island growing on average 2.1 times faster than residents of Mona Island habitats. Aggregation density and body condition index (body mass SCL-3) were also highest at Monito Island. Hawksbills recruiting to Monito Island at 23 cm SCL are expected to reach maturity less than 14.7 yr later. Growth rates in the turtles studied are similar to those reported for other Caribbean localities, but faster than hawksbills of the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Hawksbills appear capable of utilizing habitats of widely varying quality, with prey abundance exerting a strong effect on somatic growth rates."
372,3045,Back to the brink: population decline of the endangered Grassland earless dragon (Tympanocryptis pinguicolla) following its rediscovery,"Lizard populations are under serious threat through widespread decline and predictions of multiple extinctions through climate change. Yet detecting specific instances of  decline remains problematic in many situations because of inconsistent and sparse data. We assessed the stability of populations of the endangered Grassland Earless Dragons (Tympanocryptis pinguicolla) conducted after its rediscovery using capture rates at 10 sites (from 23 surveyed) and survival and population size estimation at one intensively studied site. We show a gradual non-significant decline in population size across all sites from 1995 followed by a dramatic reduction (88%) from 2006 at the most densely populated site. Using mark-recapture-release approaches, we estimate annual survival at that site to be low (0.017 to one year of age and 0.024 to adulthood) over the three years of the study. Taken together, these data suggest a regional decline among T. pinguicolla populations that place the species in grave jeopardy of becoming the first confirmed reptile extinction in Australia since European settlement. The key factors for basing further hypothesis driven monitoring include drought habitat cover (or the effects of grazing) and habitat fragmentation. We agree with other conservationists that for highly endangered species, there may not be the time required to conduct long-term monitoring. However, by making good use of even disparate past surveys, a case can be made for trends in population size. We urge that even data collected in an ad hoc manner be examined to help plan management programs for rare or endangered species."
373,3223,Seasonal numbers and distribution of shorebirds on North Carolina's Outer Banks,"We documented the seasonal abundance, distribution, and relative importance of outer beach; habitats to shorebirds on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The Outer Banks span 228 km and attract millions; of tourists every year, underscoring the need for baseline data for conservation. Twenty-one species were recorded; during the study. The most abundant were Sanderling (Culidns alba), Red Knot (Calidris canutus), and Willet; (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus). As an assemblage, shorebirds were most abundant in May and August. Peak; numbers for each species were recorded between April-May and JulySeptember. The greatest numbers were; recorded on North Beach and the lowest on South Beach (1992) and Bodie Island (1993). Shorebird abundance; was greater during fall (68 birds/km) than in spring (50 birds/km). Patterns of abundance of the eight most abundant; species were examined in detail. Black-bellied Plovers (PZuviaZis squatarola), Willets, Whimbrels (Numeniusphaeopus),; Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and Sanderlings were most abundant on North Beach. North Core; Banks harbored the highest numbers of Piping Plovers (Charudrius melodus), American Oystercatchers (Haematopus; palliatus), and Red Knots. American Oystercatchers and Whimbrels were significantly more abundant during; spring than fall, whereas Willet and Sanderlings were more abundant during fall. The Outer Banks emerged as an; important staging area for the Atlantic populations of Piping Plovers, Whimbrels, and Sanderlings when compared; to 7 other areas along the eastern U.S. coast. The importance of the area to Sanderlings was reaffirmed by return; rates of 58%, most (69989%) returning to the beach stretch where they were banded. The area gains special; significance because it also supports a nesting population of Piping Plovers. Our findings confirm that the Outer; Banks of North Carolina provide a critical link in the migratory path of several shorebird species. Habitat loss or; alteration could adversely affect the Atlantic Flyway population of several species (e.g., Sanderlings) as well as; the threatened Piping Plover."
374,1249,Biological Diversity of a Temporary Pond Herpetofauna in North Florida Sandhills,"From 1985 through 1990, the herpetofauna of a temporary pond in an uplands longleaf pine sandhills community in north-central Florida was monitored. A drift fence completely encircled the pond. Animals were captured in pitfall traps and marked as they entered and exited the pond basin. [The author] captured 16,155 individuals of 42 species (16 amphibians, 26 reptiles). The species richness, diversity (using Margalef's Diversity Index) and dominance (using the Berger-Parker Index) varied among years. Between 62.5% and 87.5% of the amphibian species and 65% to 81% of the reptile species were captured in any one year. Daily amphibian capture was positively correlated with rainfall, whereas reptile capture was either not correlated or weakly negatively correlated with rainfall. Hydroperiod duration was not correlated with the numbers of either amphibians or reptiles captured. Neither the amphibian nor the reptile community showed any trends in diversity or dominance indices during the course of the study, although both communities were dominated by a few species. However, the species responsible for community dominance changed somewhat as the study progressed. Assessing the results of this study is hampered by the lack of comparable studies elsewhere, expected natural fluctuations of amphibian populations, and a prolonged drought, especially during the latter stages of the study. The herpetological community at Breezeway Pond does not appear to follow theoretical predictions of community response to stress. Temporary ponds are important centers of herpetofaunal biodiversity in uplands sandills communities. Long-term studies are needed to monitor the composition, structure, and functional interactions of their resident species."
375,1948,Using counts to simultaneously estimate abundance and detection probabilities in a salamander community,"A critical variable in both ecological and conservation field studies is determining how many individuals of a species are present within a defined sampling area. Labor intensive techniques such as capture-mark-recapture and removal sampling may provide estimates of abundance, but there are many logistical constraints to their widespread application. Many studies on terrestrial and aquatic salamanders use counts as an index of abundance, assuming that detection remains constant while sampling. If this constancy is violated, determination of detection probabilities is critical to the accurate estimation of abundance. Recently, a model was developed that provides a statistical approach that allows abundance and detection to be estimated simultaneously from spatially and temporally replicated counts. We adapted this model to estimate these parameters for salamanders sampled over a six year period in area-constrained plots in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Estimates of salamander abundance varied among years, but annual changes in abundance did not vary uniformly among species. Except for one species, abundance estimates were not correlated with site covariates (elevation, soil and water pH, conductivity, air and water temperature). The uncertainty in the estimates was so large as to make correlations ineffectual in predicting which covariates might influence abundance. Detection probabilities also varied among species and sometimes among years for the six species examined. We found such a high degree of variation in our counts and in estimates of detection among species, sites, and years as to cast doubt upon the appropriateness of using count data to monitor population trends using a small number of area-constrained surrey plots. Still, the model provided reasonable estimates of abundance that could make it useful in estimating population size from count surveys."
376,3054,"The effects of disturbance events on abundance and sex ratios of a terrestrial turtle, Terrapene bauri","Disturbances can affect the structure of ecological communities, and their impacts; may have consequences for individual species population dynamics and long-term persistence.; Even without catastrophic mortality, survivorship could be reduced following a disturbance, thus; leading to population decline. We used a 16-year markrecapture dataset to determine the effects; of catastrophic storms and the cutting of nonindigenous vegetation on the survivorship and; abundance of a population of long-lived terrestrial turtles (Terrapene bauri). Our results indicate; that these habitat disturbances had little long-term effect on abundance. Indeed, the population; continued to grow despite severe changes to its habitat, although recapture probabilities decreased; through time. Tertiary (adult) sex ratios became more highly skewed temporarily but eventually; approached their predisturbance levels. In long-lived box turtles, short-term disturbances may; alter growth rates and dispersal tendencies, but they appear to have little long-term effect on; abundance as long as initial mortality is not severe and food resources remain available."
377,2119,Strategies of Pomatoschistus minutus and Pomatoschistus microps to cope with environmental instability,"The populations of Pomatoschistus minutus and Pomatoschistus microps were studied from June 2003 to May 2006 in the Mondego estuary, in order to understand the ability of these species to withstand environmental variability. During this period a severe drought occurred (2005), with consequent lower freshwater runoff and higher salinity incursion into the estuary. Occasional abnormal high water temperatures were observed in 2003 and 2005. The fish populations were sampled monthly along an estuarine gradient, from which population density, structure, growth and biomass production was assessed. Pomatoschistus minutus distributed mainly at the most saline downstream area, while P. microps distributed within the whole estuary, in accordance to the salinity and temperature tolerances for the species. A clear decrease in density and production was observed for P. minutus in the dry year, with non-expressive recruitments and the quick disappearance of the parental cohort. For P. microps, the decrease was not so pronounced. No direct effects were attributable to the salinity and temperatures variations (resulting from the drought and high temperatures). Yet, higher predation pressure on P. minutus hypothesis was raised, as the salinity incursion increased the piscivorous marine adventitious species in the downstream areas. Pomatoschistus microps benefited from a wider temperature and salinity range tolerance, allowing the species to occupy different areas in the estuary and by this seemed better able to cope with the environmental conditionings during the 3-year studied period.

378,2573,Evaluating a potentially strong trophic interaction: pumas and wild camelids in protected areas of Argentina,"Predatory interactions involving large carnivores and their ungulate prey are increasingly recognized as important in structuring terrestrial communities, but such interactions have seldom been studied in the temperate Neotropics. Here, the large carnivore guild is limited to a single species, the puma Puma concolor, native prey populations have been drastically reduced and lagomorphs and ungulates have been introduced. We examined puma dietary patterns under varying abundances of native camelid prey - guanacos and vicunas - in protected areas of northwestern Argentina. We collected puma feces from seven protected areas, and sampled each area for the relative abundance of camelids using on-foot strip and vehicle transects. In one area, where longitudinal studies have been conducted, we examined the remains of vicunas and guanacos for evidence of puma predation in 2004-2006. We compared our results with a study conducted in 1978-1983, and contrasted the frequency of carcasses showing signs of puma predation with estimates of camelid abundance. Across sites, we observed a positive and significant relationship between camelid Consumption by pumas and camelid abundance, with pumas about nine times more likely to consume camelids where the latter were most abundant. The temporal variation in predation rates on camelids differed by species. Guanacos, which did not change in abundance between periods, showed a slight decrease (1.5 times) in the relative frequencies of individuals killed by pumas. Conversely, vicunas increased in abundance by a factor of [approximately]7 between periods, coinciding with an c. 3.4 times increase in individuals showing evidence of puma predation. Some protected areas of northwestern Argentina are conserving the trophic interaction between pumas and native camelid prey. This interaction may be the basis of the far-reaching community effects described for analogous systems oil other continents. It also has implications for the possible recovery of or reintroduction of camelids to areas with high puma densities, where predation losses can be expected to be high, and possibly prohibitive."
379,4619,"The biology of Barbus mattozi Guimaraes (Teleostei, Cyprinidae) in a Zimbabwean reservoir. 3. Numbers, biomass and mortality","The population of B. mattozi in the Mtsheleli Dam, Zimbabwe, was estimated to be about 55 000 fish in July 1974 but fell to about 370 by June 1975. The total biomass followed a similar trend, reaching 2 000kg (43kg ha-1) in July and falling to 130kg (2.8kg ha-1) after one year. The mortality rate was very high (Z = 5.00) and considerably higher than in a number of other fishes, many of them considerably smaller than B. mattozi. The reasons for this decline are discussed and they include the effects of humans who removed about 17.5% of the total population, cannibalism, otters and birds. A remarkable feature of the population was the lack of small fish (<12cm FL), which was attributed to a failure of spawning during a serious drought in 1972-1973. The numbers of small fish began to increase from June 1975 and these were most likely the cohort spawned during the good rains of 1973-1974. Fluvial fishes in semi-arid parts of southern Africa are likely to experience wide variations in numbers determined by the success or failure of spawning in wet or dry years."
380,2812,Sea turtle bycatch in the Chilean pelagic longline fishery in the southeastern Pacific: opportunities for conservation,"Data are presented on sea turtles caught in the Chilean longline fishery targeting swordfish, Xiphias gladius, in international waters off Chile. A total of 10,604,059 hooks from 7976 sets were observed, representing 94% of the total number of hooks fished between 2001 and 2005. Leatherbacks, Dermochelys coriacea, (n = 284) and loggerheads, Caretta caretta, (n = 59) were the most common species captured. Leatherbacks were caught in less than 4% of the sets, with an overall mean of 0.0268 turtles per 1000 hooks. Loggerheads were caught in less than 1% of the sets with a mean catch rate of 0.0056 turtles per 1000 hooks. Most leatherbacks (97.5% of total) were caught between 24[degree]S and 38[degree]S, while loggerheads were caught primarily in the northern portion of the area fished, between 24[degree]19[minute]S and 25[degree]31[minute]S. All loggerheads were dehooked where appropriate and released alive. A total of two leatherbacks were found dead. Despite the low catch rate of leatherbacks, the potential impact of this fishery on the severely depleted nesting populations in the eastern Pacific could be significant when combined with other fisheries and threats in the region. The very low mortality of bycaught sea turtles observed in our study is encouraging and suggests that there are opportunities for further reducing harmful effects of swordfish longline fishing on sea turtles. Results of spatial analysis of loggerhead bycatch relative to fishing effort show that closure of the northernmost fishing area would eliminate the majority of the loggerhead bycatch.

382,3957,Chronic effects of an invasive species on an animal community," Invasive species can trigger trophic cascades in animal communities, but published cases involving their removal of top predators are extremely rare. An exception is the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) in Australia, which has caused severe population declines in monitor lizards, triggering trophic cascades that facilitated dramatic and sometimes unexpected increases in several prey of the predators, including smaller lizards, snakes, turtles, crocodiles, and birds. Persistence of isolated populations of these predators with a decadeslong sympatry with toads suggests the possibility of recovery, but alternative explanations are possible. Confirming predator recovery requires longer-term study of populations with both baseline and immediate post-invasion densities. Previously, we quantified short-term impacts of invasive cane toads on animal communities over seven years at two sites in tropical Australia. Herein, we test the hypothesis that predators have begun to recover by repeating the study 12 yr after the initial toad invasion. The three predatory lizards that experienced 7197% declines in the short-term study showed no sign of recovery, and indeed a worse fate: two of the three species were no longer detectable in 630 km of river surveys, suggesting local extirpation. Two mesopredators that had increased markedly in the short term due to these predator losses showed diverse responses in the medium term; a small lizard species increased by ~500%, while populations of a snake species showed little change. Our results indicate a system still in ecological turmoil, having not yet reached a new equilibrium more than a decade after the initial invasion; predator losses due to this toxic invasive species, and thus downstream effects, were not transient. Given that cane toads have proven too prolific to eradicate or control, we suggest that recovery of impacted predators must occur unassisted by evolutionary means: dispersal into extinction sites from surviving populations with alleles for toxin resistance or toad avoidance. Evolution and subsequent dispersal may be the only solution for a number of species or communities affected by invasive species for which control is either prohibitively expensive, or not possible. "
383,1461,Crab trapping causes population decline and demographic changes in diamondback terrapins over two decades.,"Diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) are thought to be declining throughout their range. Although many factors have been proposed to contribute to terrapin declines, including increased predation of nests and adults, habitat loss and degradation, road mortality, commercial harvest for food, and mortality as bycatch in crab traps, few studies have provided evidence linking these agents to population declines. Because male and small female terrapins are most susceptible to mortality in crab traps, population declines should coincide with shifts in the age and size distributions of the population and a shift to a more female-biased sex ratio. We used twenty-one years of mark-recapture data (>2800 captures of 1399 individuals) from a declining diamondback terrapin population in South Carolina to test the prediction that the decline is the result of mortality in crab traps. Since the 1980s, the modal size of both male and female terrapins has increased substantially and the proportion that are females is higher than in earlier samples. Additionally, the population now contains more old and fewer young individuals than before. The changes in demography and sex ratio we observed suggest that this terrapin population has declined as a result of selective mortality of smaller individuals in crab traps. The use of bycatch-reduction devices on crab traps may help prevent terrapins from entering the traps, but current models are too large to prevent mortality of males and many females in this population. Future research should focus on design and testing of effective bycatch-reduction devices for specific regions and other methods to prevent terrapin mortality in crab traps. "
384,3458,Severe mammal declines coincide with proliferation of invasive Burmese pythons in Everglades National Park,"Invasive species represent a significant threat to global biodiversity and a substantial economic burden. Burmese pythons, giant constricting snakes native to Asia, now are found throughout much of southern Florida, including all of Everglades National Park (ENP). Pythons have increased dramatically in both abundance and geographic range since 2000 and consume a wide variety of mammals and birds. Here we report severe apparent declines in mammal populations that coincide temporally and spatially with the proliferation of pythons in ENP. Before 2000, mammals were encountered frequently during nocturnal road surveys within ENP. In contrast, road surveys totaling 56,971 km from 2003-2011 documented a 99.3% decrease in the frequency of raccoon observations, decreases of 98.9% and 87.5% for opossum and bobcat observations, respectively, and failed to detect rabbits. Road surveys also revealed that these species are more common in areas where pythons have been discovered only recently and are most abundant outside the python's current introduced range. These findings suggest that predation by pythons has resulted in dramatic declines in mammals within ENP and that introduced apex predators, such as giant constrictors, can exert significant top-down pressure on prey populations. Severe declines in easily observed and/or common mammals, such as raccoons and bobcats, bode poorly for species of conservation concern, which often are more difficult to sample and occur at lower densities."
385,3791,Fifteen years of annual Cape Parrot Poicephalus robustus censuses: current population trends and conservation contributions,"The Cape Parrot Poicephalus robustus is endemic to South Africa and numbers have reportedly declined since the early 1900s. It is a forest specialist and food nomadic, moving between patches depending on fruit availability. This makes it difficult to estimate numbers accurately and to determine its distribution. The annual Cape Parrot Big Birding Day was initiated in 1998 as a national census to determine a population estimate. Volunteers assist in monitoring and counting the Cape Parrot in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo provinces in indigenous forests as well as sites where the parrots are known to feed outside of forests. Here, a summary of 15 years of census data is presented. In all years, with the exception of 2009, less than 1 600 Cape Parrots were recorded in the wild. The census data showed a slight increase in Cape Parrots, although this may be largely explained by an increase in coverage of suitable habitat and stabilisation in the population since 2005. A current distribution map for the Cape Parrot, based on census data, is presented. The distribution remains largely unchanged from that presented in the 1970s. This study highlights the value of public participation in monitoring an Endangered species and the need to conserve the forests where these parrots occur, due to their nomadic feeding behaviour."
386,2785,Joint effects of inverse density-dependence and extreme environmental variation on the viability of a social bird species,"Environmental stochasticity and density-dependence can have critical synergetic effects on population dynamics, especially when dealing with threatened species. In this study, we examine the effects of these interactions on the dynamics of a vulnerable bird species, the Dalmatian pelican (Pelicanus crispus). We conducted demographic analysis and population dynamics modelling of the Amvrakikos pelican population (western Greece) based on a 20-y dataset. Results indicated that annual juvenile survival probability is low (mean = 0.65) and varies according to both negative (regulation) and positive (Allee effect) density-dependent processes. In contrast, adult survival is relatively high (mean = 0.95) and less variable. Deterministic and stochastic population dynamics models based on means, inter-annual variances, and covariances between vital rates revealed that the population is increasing deterministically. Simulations of the extinction risk for the study population and also for various population sizes revealed that short-term extinction risk remains extremely low, even for very small populations of the species. However, when we considered the possibility of rare catastrophic events and their interactions with density-dependence patterns, the projected extinction risk increased dramatically, especially for small populations. Given that many European Dalmatian pelican populations are small, most of them could be at risk for local extinction. Our results illustrate the critical and general importance of considering interactions between all potential factors of extinction in population viability assessments."
387,906,Spatial conservation management of the orange-bellied parrot Neophema chrysogaster,The Orange-bellied Parrot is endangered in south-eastern Australia. In the winter it is dispersed over a long band of coastal habitat ranging from Victoria to South Australia. The present model study compares the benefits of habitat management in the Victorian and the South Australian parts of the winter habitat. Various management options are compared in a sensitivity analysis. The results show that management in Victoria has a stronger influence on the population than management in South Australia. The population parameters are subject to considerable uncertainty. The sensitivity of the results to the values assigned to the model parameters is explored. The results are valid over a wide range of the plausible parameter space.
388,3105,Status of lesser snow geese and Ross's geese wintering in the Interior Highlands of Mexico,"During winters 1998 and 1999 we surveyed, by air or ground, 145 wetland areas in 8 states of the Mexican Interior Highlands for lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and Ross's geese (C. rossii; hereafter both species are jointly referred to as light geese). Only limited data were available on abundance, distribution, habitat use, and species composi- tion of light geese flocks wintering in the Mexican Interior Highlands. We surveyed wetlands from the northern border of Chihuahua southward >1,400 km into the states of Jalisco and Michoacan. During ground surveys we visually sampled geese to assess species, color phase, and age composition (n=60,967). In 1998, drought in the northern Highlands left many natural wetlands dry or nearly dry; wetland water levels farther south were generally low. In 1999 water levels improved in the northern Highlands but drought prevailed in the southern Highlands. During 1998 and 1999 we recorded 229,288 and 310,204 light geese, respectively, at 58 wetlands in 5 states. Combining our counts with the midwinter invento- ries in the United States provided estimates of 465,653 and 447,729 light geese wintering in the western Central Flyway during 1998 and 1999, respectively, or 76-83% higher than the previous peak estimate in winter 1 993. Most light geese (95O/%) were in the northern states of Chihuahua and Durango. Species ratios, weighted by flock size, showed 78.5% and 81.2% snow geese (1.3-1.5% blue phase) and 21.5% and 18.8% Ross's geese during win- ters 1998 and 1999, respectively. Population estimates by species included 180,100 and 252,000 snow geese and 49,200 and 58,200 Ross's geese for the 2 winters, respectively. Ross's geese were most abundant in Chihuahua, and their proportion in flocks declined southward. We observed higher proportions of Ross's geese and blue-phase snow geese than were reported in this region during the 1980s. Primary foraging sites for light geese were corn, oats, and sorghum fields. We observed little waterfowl hunting, and opportunities to increase harvest of light geese, if desired in the future, appear limited due to restrictive hunt- ing regulations, especially for foreigners. Changing land uses and crop patterns could adversely affect the future quality and quantity of some winter habitats for light geese and other migratory birds in Mexico. Only combined counts in Mexico and the United States can reliably assess the population status of western Central Flyway light geese; 1 5 surveys during 1969-99 showed that an average of 60.6% of the population wintered in Mexico."

390,3516,"Population status of 14 shark species caught in the protective gillnets off KwaZulu–Natal beaches, South Africa, 1978–2003","Shark nets have been set off the beaches of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, since 1952 to reduce the risk of shark attack. The nets fish in fixed localities 400 m from shore and both directly affect local shark populations and act as fisheries-independent monitoring devices. Reliable catch information at the species level was available for the period 1978-2003. Trends in catch rate and size were used to assess the population status of 14 commonly caught shark species. In addition, a demographic modelling approach was used in conjunction with the catch information to assess the potential effect of the nets on populations. Catch rates of four species (Carcharhinus leucas, C. limbatus, Sphyrna lewini and S. mokarran) showed a significant decline, as did the mean or median length of three species (Carcharhinus amboinensis, C. limbatus and female Carcharodon carcharias). For three species that showed declining catch rates or length the potential effect of the shark nets was assessed to be low, suggesting that other sources of catch were responsible for the declining status. The potential effect of the shark nets was assessed to be high for two species (Carcharhinus obscurus and Carcharias taurus, neither of which showed declines in catch rate or length), because of very low intrinsic rates of population increase.

391,4359,Effects of anthropogenic food resources on yellow-legged gull colony size on Mediterranean islands,"Yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis populations have been studied on three archipelagos consisting of 20 islands distributed along 80 km of the French Mediterranean coastline. Population changes were analyzed between 1920 and 2006. In the first decades following their settlement on these islands, the yellow-legged gull populations showed a continuous exponential growth in the three archipelagos, in agreement with an annual geometric growth rate λ above 1. The population growth ceased to fit this model during the 1980s for the older colonies (Riou and Hyères Islands archipelagos). Thus, we focused on population changes occurring during the period 1982-2000, a pivotal period for which we have both precise census and anthropogenic food resource data, in order to determine environmental factors influencing these population changes using multiple linear regression models. An average annual growth rate of colony size was 1.02 for the last two decades. The changes in landfill availability, the gull density in 1982, and the nesting area in 1982 explained 84.4% of variation in colony size changes between 1982 and 2000. The yellow-legged gull changes on the islands in the last two decades increased as availability in anthropogenic food resources increased near the colony (positive ΔK). As a consequence, given no reduction in landfill activity or in accessibility for gulls, we expect this region to sustain continuous species expansion in the future. "
392,1884,"Fishery Stability, Local Extinctions, and Shifts in Community Structure in Skates","Skates are arguably the most vulnerable of exploited marine fishes. Their vulnerability is often assessed by examining fisheries catch trends, but these data are not generally recorded on a species basis except in France. Aggregated skate catch statistics tend to exhibit more stable trends than those of other elasmobranch fisheries. We tested whether such apparent stability in aggregated catch trends could mask population declines of individual species. We examined two time series of species-specific surveys of a relatively stable skate fishery in the northeast Atlantic. These surveys revealed the disappearance of two skate species, longnose skate (Dipturus oxyrhinchus) and white skate (Rostroraja alba) and confirmed a previously documented decline of the common skate (D. batis). Of the remaining five skate species, the three larger ones have declined, whereas two smaller species have increased in abundance. The increase in abundance and biomass of the smaller species has resulted in the stability of the aggregated catch trends. Because there is significant dietary overlap among species, we suggest the increase in abundance of the smaller species may be due to competitive release as the larger species declined. A consequence of this kind of stability is that declining species cannot be detected without species-specific data, especially in taxa exhibiting competitive interactions. This may explain why previously documented disappearances of two species of skates went unnoticed for so long. The conservation of skates and other elasmobranchs requires species-specific monitoring and special attention to larger species."
393,3843,"Trends in populations of elephant and other large herbivores in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe, as revealed by sample aerial surveys","For 30 years, regular aerial surveys in Zimbabwean protected areas were funded, designed and executed primarily to estimate elephant numbers. Other large herbivores were recorded, even though some species were not easily seen from the air in savannah woodlands. Population estimates for species other than elephant provided indices of abundance that could be used to determine temporal trends in population size. This study tests for significant trends in the abundance of large herbivores in Gonarezhou National Park, assuming that data from aerial sample surveys designed for elephant also provide accurate estimates of real trends in the populations of other herbivores. For each species, the exponential rate of population change was calculated using weighted regression, with the variance of this rate based on the sampling variances of the population estimates. Significant population trends were detected for eight species. Before the 1992 drought, elephant number was held approximately constant by frequent culls, but afterwards, it increased at a mean annual rate of 6.2% (confidence limits 4.0% and 8.6%). Elephants in cow herds increased at 7.3%, significantly faster than elephants in bull herds (0.5%). Buffalo, eland, kudu, nyala, waterbuck, wildebeest and zebra all increased in number, after population declines during the drought."
394,4041,"Population size and decadal trends of three penguin species nesting at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands","We report long-term changes in population size of three species of sympatrically breeding pygoscelid penguins: Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua ellsworthii) over a 38 year period at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, based on annual counts from selected colonies and decadal all-island systematic counts of occupied nests. Comparing total numbers of breeding pairs over the whole island from 1978/79 to 2015/16 revealed varying fortunes: gentoo penguin pairs increased by 255%, (3.5% per annum), chinstrap penguins declined by 68% (-3.6% per annum) and Adelie penguins declined by 42% (-1.5% per annum). The chinstrap population has declined steadily over the last four decades. In contrast, Adelie and gentoo penguins have experienced phases of population increase and decline. Annual surveys of selected chinstrap and Adelie colonies produced similar trends from those revealed by island-wide surveys, allowing total island population trends to be inferred relatively well. However, while the annual colony counts of chinstrap and Adelie penguins showed a trend consistent in direction with the results from all-island surveys, the magnitude of estimated population change was markedly different between colony wide and all island counts. Annual population patterns suggest that pair numbers in the study areas partly reflect immigration and emigration of nesting birds between different parts of the island. Breeding success for all three species remained broadly stable over time in the annually monitored colonies. Breeding success rates in gentoo and chinstrap penguins were strongly correlated, despite the differing trends in population size. This study shows the importance of effective, standardised monitoring to accurately determine long-term population trajectories. Our results indicate significant declines in the Adelie and chinstrap penguin populations at Signy Island over the last five decades, and a gradual increase in gentoo breeding pairs."
395,4433,"Population size and trends of southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) nesting at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands","The southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus) has a circumpolar distribution and breeds on subantarctic islands and a few continental Antarctic sites. Although this species has recently been down-listed to Least Concern by the World Conservation Union (IUCN), there are strong fluctuations in abundance and variable long-term trends recorded at different sites. Systematic, long-term monitoring is essential to determine drivers underlying its population dynamics. Here, we examine long-term changes in population size and productivity of southern giant petrels at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands. Comparing estimated numbers of breeding pairs over the whole island in 2000/2001, 2005/2006, 2009/2010 and 2014/2015 with historical data revealed several phases of population change: a 64 % decline (6.2 % per annum) from 1968/1969 to 1984/1985, a 162 % increase (6.2 % per annum) to 2000/2001, stability until 2005/2006, a 56 % decline (18.3 % per annum) to 2009/2010 and stability until 2014/2015. This represents a 1.8 % decline per annum between 1968/1969 and 2014/2015. Annual counts within focal study areas suggested a more rapid increase from 1996/1997 to 2006/2007, but the same downward trend from 2006/2007 to present, underlining potential pitfalls in inferring trends from part-island counts. There was also a 20 % decline in breeding success from 1996/1997 to 2014/2015. Our results indicate substantial fluctuations in southern giant petrel abundance at Signy Island over 45 decades and a recent decline in breeding numbers and success. As the southern giant petrels breeding at the South Orkney Islands represents ~510 % of the global population, continuation of these declines would be of high conservation concern."
396,2845,"Long-term trends in carnivore abundance using distance sampling in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania","1. Carnivores can have critical impacts on ecosystems, provide economic value through tourism and are often important flagships. However, their biological traits (e.g. low density, cryptic colouration and behaviour) make them difficult to monitor and hence wildlife managers rarely have access to reliable information on population trends, and long-term information at the community level is almost completely lacking. 2. We use data from transect counts in the Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania to examine trends in abundance for seven co-existing carnivore species. Distance-based transect counts between 2002 and 2005 are compared with adjusted data from fixed-width transect counts across the same area in 1977 and 1986. 3. Distance-based methods provided density indices for the seven most commonly seen carnivores: lion Panthera leo, spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta, golden jackal Canis aureus, black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas, cheetah Acinonyx jubatus, side-striped jackal Canis audustis and bat-eared fox Otocyon megalotis. Detection curves were used to correct estimates from earlier fixed-width transect counts. 4. Trend analyses detected significant declines in densities of golden and black-backed jackal and bat-eared fox, but found no significant changes in spotted hyaena, lion, cheetah and side-striped jackal. 5. Overall, despite wide confidence intervals, we show that distance-based data can be used effectively to detect long-term trends and provide critical information for conservation managers. Power analysis demonstrated that for the most frequently seen species, spotted hyaena, golden jackal and lion, abrupt declines of up to 20% may be detectable through long-term monitoring; however, for the remaining species, declines of 50% may only be detected half the time. 6. Synthesis and applications. Distance methods provide a tool for rapid counts and monitoring of several species of carnivores simultaneously in suitable habitats and can be combined with historical fixed-width transect counts to test for changes in density. The method can provide key information to managers on long-term population trends and sudden abrupt changes in population size across a carnivore community."
397,383,Population ecology of white-tailed deer along the lower Yellowstone River.,"Odocoileus virginianus dacotensis were studied along the lower Yellowstone River, E Montana. Autumn populations on the 224-km2 study area increased from 3100 in 1980 to 5784 in 1983 and declined through 1986 in response to hunter harvests and density-influenced fawn recruitment. Fawns composed 32-43% of autumn populations; deer ≤2 yr accounted for 63% of all females and 93% of all males. Antlered males made up 16-23% of prehunt populations; <1% were ≥4 yr of age. Median breeding date was 21 November. Pregnancy rate for females ≥1 yr was 93%. Age-specific production and recruitment rates increased through age classes 6-7, then declined. Average annual mortality rates were 50% for fawns, 22% for adult females, and 60% for adult males. Neonatal and summer mortality accounted for 32% of all fawns produced and varied directly with density of females ≥2 yr old. Hunting accounted for 81% of all mortality among deer >6 months, or 13-35% of autumn populations; and equaled or exceeded fawn recruitment during 1983-86. Low overwinter mortality, high productivity, and seasonal trends in whole weights and kidney fat indexes collectively indicated that the population wintered on a high nutritional plane. Selection for specific crop types and/or riparian forest-shrub communities varied temporally and spatially with availability and sex and age of deer. Deer were generally nonmigratory, but moved extensively in the study area. Difference between diel and diurnal movement indexes increased from summer to winter. Females exhibited a higher fidelity to summer than winter ranges. Agricultural crops accounted for 41% of the yearlong diet. -from Authors"
398,2357,Increase of a Caribbean leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea nesting population linked to long-term nest protection,"The leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea is considered to be at serious risk of global extinction, despite ongoing conservation efforts. Intensive long-term monitoring of a leatherback nesting population on Sandy Point (St. Croix, US Virgin Islands) offers a unique opportunity to quantify basic population parameters and evaluate effectiveness of nesting beach conservation practices. We report a significant increase in the number of females nesting annually from ca. 18-30 in the 1980s to 186 in 2001, with a corresponding increase in annual hatchling production from ca. 2000 to over 49,000. We then analyzed resighting data from 1991 to 2001 with an open robust-design capture-mark-recapture model to estimate annual nester survival and adult abundance for this population. The expected annual survival probability was estimated at ca. 0.893 (95% CL 0.87-0.92) and the population was estimated to be increasing ca. 13% pa since the early 1990s. Taken together with DNA fingerprinting that identify mother-daughter relations, our findings suggest that the increase in the size of the nesting population since 1991 was probably due to an aggressive program of beach protection and egg relocation initiated more than 20 years ago. Beach protection and egg relocation provide a simple and effective conservation strategy for this Northern Caribbean nesting population as long as adult survival at sea remains relatively high. "

This research provides baseline breeding population estimates for nine of 16 islands in the Capricornia Group over five years for Shearwaters (1996 - 2000) and four years for Noddies (1997 - 2000). With estimates of [approximately]302000 active breeding pairs of Black Noddies and [approximately]560000 breeding pairs of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters in the area, the research results have confirmed the importance of the Capricornia Group as a recognised breeding area for these birds."
400,2254,Population size and trend of yellow-billed loons in northern Alaska,"The Yellow-billed Loon (Gavia adamsii) is of conservation concern due to its restricted range, small population size, specific habitat requirements, and perceived threats to its breeding and wintering habitat. Within the U.S., this species breeds almost entirely within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, nearly all of which is open, or proposed to be opened, for oil development. Rigorous estimates of Yellow-billed Loon population size and trend are lacking but essential for informed conservation. We used two annual aerial waterfowl surveys, conducted 1986-2003 and 1992-2003, to estimate population size and trend on northern Alaskan breeding grounds. In estimating population trend, we used mixed-effects regression models to reduce bias and sampling error associated with improvement in observer skill and annual effects of spring phenology. The estimated population trend on Alaskan breeding grounds since 1986 was near 0 with an estimated annual change of -0.9% (95% CI of -3.6% to +1.8%). The estimated population size, averaged over the past 12 years and adjusted by a correction factor based on an intensive, lake-circling, aerial survey method, was 2221 individuals (95% CI of 1206-3235) in early June and 3369 individuals (95% CI of 1910-4828) in late June. Based on estimates from other studies of the proportion of loons nesting in a given year, it is likely that <1000 nesting pairs inhabit northern Alaska in most years. The highest concentration of Yellow-billed Loons occurred between the Meade and Ikpikpuk Rivers; and across all of northern Alaska, 53% of recorded sightings occurred within 12% of the area. "
401,143,"Status and distribution of the endangered Lion-Tailed Macaque Macaca silenus in Kerala, India.","The tropical rainforest in the south-western Ghats of Kerala State was surveyed in May 1993 with the help of trained volunteers and Forest department stair to assess the status and distribution of the endangered lion-tailed macaque Macaca silenus. A total of 564 macaques in 64 troops were sighted during the survey. It is estimated that the number of lion-tailed macaques in Kerala is a minimum of 1216 but only three areas are identified as having viable populations with long-term conservation prospects. Most sightings of troops were in Protected Areas. The present survey indicates its absence in the ranges reported earlier, such as Cardamom Hills and South Wayanad. Maintenance of existing contiguous patches of evergreen forest and inclusion of suitable management strategies in Working Plans for non-Protected Areas are suggested."
402,765,Indirect effects of fish winterkills on amphibian populations in boreal lakes,"We exploited fish winterkills in small, boreal Alberta lakes to determine if anuran amphibians respond to large but natural changes in fish densities. Eight large declines in fish abundance occurred in seven lakes over a 5 year period, while major increases in fish abundance, reflecting recovery after winterkill, were recorded 5 times. Summer pitfall trapping of young-of-the-year (YOY) Wood Frogs (Rana sylvatica LeConte, 1825) and Boreal (Bufo boreas boreas Baird and Girard, 1852) and Canadian (Bufo hemiophrys Cope, 1886) toads indicated that frog abundance responded consistently to such large changes in fish abundance, but especially if fish communities were dominated by small-bodied species (sticklebacks and minnows). As well, changes in YOY Wood Frog and fish abundance were negatively correlated; YOY Wood Frogs were as much as 7.7 times more abundant after winterkills than in non-winterkill years. These increases in metamorphs did not result from an increased immigration of breeding adults to winterkill lakes, suggesting instead that larval survival was greater. Higher abundance of YOY Wood Frogs and toads was associated with smaller body size at metamorphosis. Despite this apparent reduction in individual growth, abundance of juvenile frogs remained significantly elevated 1 year after winterkill. In contrast to Wood Frogs, YOY toads tended to respond positively to recoveries of small-fish populations. Because anuran amphibians can respond to fish winterkill, and because winterkill is a frequent natural disturbance, small fish-bearing lakes can serve as important breeding habitat for amphibians in Alberta's boreal forest. "
403,4135,Conservation challenges of a sink: the viability of an isolated population of the Snowy Plover,"Source-sink dynamics are easily overlooked when formulating recovery objectives for threatened species. This could lead to unrealistic criteria imposed on sink populations, which in turn might restrict an entire metapopulation from being delisted. Therefore, an understanding of the viability of subpopulations within the context of a metapopulation is needed to develop appropriate recovery objectives. Consequently, we used 11 years of mark-recapture, productivity, and movement data to analyse the viability of a small, geographically isolated population of the Snowy Plover Charadrius nivosus , a shorebird listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Simulations confirmed that the focal population in northern California is a sink that relies upon immigrants from neighbouring populations. Furthermore, these source populations will increase within the next 50 years and are likely to achieve the delisting requirements. However, the northern California population is unlikely to reach the delisting criteria given the current vital rate estimations. Management scenarios demonstrated that lethal predator removal and reducing human disturbance facilitate population recovery and may partially alleviate the reliance upon immigration. However, the use of nest exclosures reduced population growth because they are known to compromise adult survival. These results highlight the importance of maintaining viable source populations and re-evaluating the recovery objectives of metapopulations with active sinks."
404,3231,"Demography, sex ratio, and sexual size dimorphism in a northern population of common musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus)","A population of common musk turtles (Sternotherus odoratus) was studied in Georgian Bay, Ontario, near the; northern limit of the species' range, during the summers of 1991 - 1994. A total of 3 14 (229 adult males, 68 adult; females, and 17 juveniles) turtles were captured, marked, measured, and released. Over the geographic range of S. odorutus; there was a positive relationship between body size and latitude, the musk turtles of the Georgian Bay population being; significantly larger than those in any of the more southerly populations. The sex ratio was significantly male-biased, and; the study population was unique in having sexual size dimorphism, with significantly larger males. We have hypothesized; that this dimorphism has arisen through sexual selection that is being driven by the male-biased sex ratio. Male-male; competition for mates is intensified and thereby selects for larger males. Proximately, biased sex ratios and sexual size; dimorphism in turtles have been attributed to differential ages and sizes at sexual maturity. However, we found no; support for this hypothesis in our population. We have attributed sexual size dimorphism to either differential growth; rates after maturity or differential mortality of adults. The male-biased sex ratio may be due to differential movement; patterns, differential mortality of the sexes, or the effects of ambient temperature on sex determination."

406,1626,"Growth, survival and production of juvenile salmon and trout in a Scottish stream, 1966-75","Investigations of the growth, survival and production of young salmon Salmo salar, brown trout and sea trout S. trutta in sections of a stream in Scotland were made during 1966–75. At the end of the growing season, in autumn, the size of the 0+ salmon ranged from a mean weight of 1.12 g in 1966 to 2.82 g in 1973, and the size of the 0+ trout ranged from a mean of 2.20 g in 1966 to 3.56 g (68.0 mm) in 1974. Growth rates of 0+ salmon between July to September were similar from year to year, as was the case with the 0+ trout. The greater size attained in their first year by trout, resulted from the longer feeding season, provided by earlier emergence of fry and ability to continue growing in colder weather in autumn. The lengths attained by 0+ salmon and 0+ trout in September were related to the population densities of 0+ salmon and the number of days above 0° C from 1 December. There was no discernible relationship between lengths of 0+ trout and the population densities of 0+ trout. Salmon and trout lost weight during the winter, which was made up by April. The densities of 0+ salmon in June varied between 2–12m –2. Rates of decrease of the population densities in their first year were related to their densities at the beginning of the season, and, more closely, to the densities of salmon and trout combined. At the end of the second year's growth there were between 0.06 and 0.25 salmon m –2. Size of the trout populations varied less from year to year than those of salmon. The life of a year class of salmon and trout could be divided into several stages characterized by different rates of decrease of the population. "
407,2739,The occurrence and reestablishment of white-tailed eagle and golden eagle as breeding birds in Denmark,"Except for a number of largely unsuccessful breeding attempts during the second half of the 20th century, thE White-tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla had been absent as a breeding bird in Denmark for more than 80 years, when a population established itself during the second half of the 1990s. Released from persecution and contaminants the populatior has grown to 37 pairs in just 16 years. Reproductive success has grown with age and experience of the birds, so that thE average number of fledged young per breeding pair peaked with almost two per pair 8-10 years after the establishmen of each breeding pair. Similarly, the Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos reestablished a small population in Denmark frorr 1999 onwards after probably having bred here until about 150 years ago. For both species, this success was facilitated b) conservation efforts including protection zones around eagle nests, monitoring and public outreach mainly carried out b) volunteers from the Danish Ornithological Society / BirdLife Denmark."

409,3082,Declines amongst breeding Eider Somateria mollissima numbers in the Baltic/Wadden Sea flyway,"We report on the status of theBaltic/Wadden Sea flyway Eider population based on trends in breeding and wintering numbers throughout the region, supplemented by changes in the sex ratio and proportion of young Eiders as monitored in the Danish hunting bag. At the flyway scale, total numbers of breeding pairs decreased by 48% during 20002009, after relatively stable breeding numbers in 19912000. The majority of the population nest in Finland and Sweden,where the number of breeding pairs has halved over the same period. After initial declines in winter numbers between 1991 and 2000, during 20002009, national wintering numbers increased in the Baltic Sea, but decreased in the Wadden Sea. The annual proportion of adult females in the Danish hunting bag data decreased from ca.45%(1982) to ca.25%(2009) and simultaneously the proportion of firstwinter birds fell from ca. 70% to ca. 30%, indicating dramatic structural changes in the Danish wintering numbers. These results suggest that the total flyway populationwill experience further declines, unless productivity increases and the factors responsible for decreasing adult female survival are identified and ameliorated.We discuss potential population drivers and present some recommendations for improved flyway-levelmonitoring and management of Eiders."
410,3440,Declining numbers of Western screech-owl in the lower mainland of British Columbia,"During 1998-2002, I visited 22 locations in the Lower Mainland where Western Screech-Owls (Megascops kennicottii) were known to occur. I visited each location five or more times and used playback tapes to attract screech-owls. There were positive responses from five locations during the first portion of the study, but by the end of the study, I concluded that screech-owls had disappeared from all 22 locations. Christmas Bird Count data from 1988 to 2004 indicate that on Vancouver Island, screech-owl numbers declined at an average annual rate of 17% while those in the Lower Mainland declined at an average annual rate of 32%. Screech-owls declined earlier for those Christmas Bird Counts which showed an earlier increase in Barred Owls (Strix varia) and for those which showed the greatest final number of Barred Owls (i.e. post-invasion). By combining my data with those of Robertson et al. (2000), I found that screech-owls were detected more often in fragments of forest that were smaller than approximately 20 ha. I therefore concluded that screech-owls were rapidly disappearing from the Lower Mainland and that the likely causes were predation by Barred Owls, in conjunction with increased competition for cavities and habitat loss."
411,4478,An overview of the biology and status of undulate ray Raja undulata in the north-east Atlantic Ocean,"The undulate ray Raja undulata is one of the lesser-known skates occurring on the continental shelf of the north-east Atlantic Ocean. It is patchily distributed throughout its range, with sites of local abundance in the central English Channel and off the coasts of Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal. Raja undulata is most abundant in coastal waters (<50 m deep) and is often found in proximity to large estuaries, rias and bays. It is a relatively large-bodied species, attaining a maximum total length (LT) of at least 114 cm, with females maturing at an LT of c. 84 cm in Portuguese waters. Although infrequently taken in existing trawl surveys, it can be locally abundant in certain areas, where it can be the dominant skate species. Given its large size, patchy distribution and concern over the possibilities of localized depletions, the IUCN listed R. undulata as an endangered species and, since 2009, the European Union has established regulations to prohibit commercial fisheries landing the species. Given the increased interest in the species, a synopsis of current knowledge is provided, and available data from internationally co-ordinated trawl surveys presented."
412,1304,"Long-term survival, length of breeding season, and operational sex ratio in a boreal population of common frogs, Rana temporaria L.","A population of marked adult Rana temporaria was studied during the breeding season in 1979-1988 in E-central Sweden. Annual return rate averaged 31% (range 16-51%) in males and 16% (range 5-33%) in females. Return rate was not size dependent but increased with every successful previous hibernation, indicating an increased survival rate with age. Return rate was not correlated with winter harshness. Once adult, males had on average 1.5 (maximum 6) seasons with the possibility of reproducing. Corresponding values for females were 1.4 and 4. Mean length of the breeding season was 20 (SD = 2) days. Calling generally started at water temperatures <3°C. Lowest spawning temperature was 1°C. Average temperatures at spawning onset and peak spawning were 5 and 6°C, respectively. Large males tended to arrive earlier at the pond than small males. Males arrived earlier and stayed longer than did females. The overall population sex ratio was close to unity. The operational sex ratio (OSR) varied during the breeding season, averaging 0.54 (1 female to 2 males). No male was observed to mate more than once per season. Survival selection is probably more important to male lifetime mating success than is competition in the breeding pond (sexual selection as affected by OSR and length of the breeding season). -Author"
413,4623,"Population size and relative abundance of adult Alabama shad reaching Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam, Apalachicola River, Florida","We estimated the population size of migrating Alabama shad Alosa alabamae below Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam in the Apalachicola River (located in the central panhandle of northwestern Florida) using mark-recapture and relative abundance techniques. After adjustment for tag loss, emigration, and mortality, the population size was estimated as 25,935 (95% confidence interval, 17,715-39,535) in 2005, 2,767 (838-5,031) in 2006, and 8,511 (5,211-14,674) in 2007. The cumulative catch rate from boat electrofishing averaged 20.47 Alabama shad per hour in 2005, 6.10 per hour in 2006, and 13.17 per hour in 2007. The relationship between population size (N) and electrofishing catch per unit effort (CPUE) was modeled by the equation N = -9008.2 + (electrofishing CPUE X 1616.4). Additionally, in 2007 the hook-and-line catch rate averaged 1.94 Alabama shad per rod hour. A predictive model relating the population size and hook-and-line CPUE of spawning American shad A. sapidissima was applied to Alabama shad hook-and-line CPUE and produced satisfactory results. Recent spawning populations of Alabama shad in the Apalachicola River are low relative to American shad populations in other southeastern U.S. rivers. "
414,3827,Long-Term Variation in Small Mammal Abundance in Forest and Savanna of Bolivian Cerrado,"Small mammals were trapped annually in two savanna and two forest plots in cerrado habitats of Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, Santa Cruz, Bolivia, for 510 yr. Eighteen species were captured in forest and seven species in savanna. Species numbers and total number of individuals captured were tightly correlated. In forest, species and abundance varied interannually by up to fourfold in one plot and to 100-fold in the other, and showed alternating highs and lows as is typical for small mammals. The largest faunal differences were due not to site differences, but to year differences, with markedly different patterns in forests and savannas. Abundance was not correlated with rainfall overall, but showed correlation in exceptional years of rainfall and ENSO drought. In savanna, species and overall abundance declined without recovery during 3 yr after reaching minimum numbers in 2004. One species, Cavia aperea, became extinct on both plots, and subsequently, apparently on the entire savanna. Both herbivorous and insectivorous species declined together. Rainfall, fire, and flooding do not seem to account for savanna rodent declines. I propose the novel hypothesis that smoke from anthropogenic burning raises nocturnal temperatures and prevents dew formation, and that a decrease in nightly dry season dewfall has been instrumental in rodent declines. Anecdotal and climatic data are consistent with this hypothesis, but it cannot yet be tested."
415,4554,Survey of ﬁshes within a restored mangrove habitat of a subtropical bay,"Mangroves provide essential habitat for juvenile fish species. Restoration and monitoring are important conservation tools to ensure the recovery and maintenance of coastal mangrove habitats impacted by humans. In this study, Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRVUS) were used to non-invasively examine the relative abundance and richness of fishes within restored mangrove pools in Biscayne Bay, Florida, 15 years after replanting. The potential influence of several environmental factors on fish abundance and richness within the restored mangrove pools was also evaluated. Limited seine sampling was also conducted to provide a comparison of the current fish assemblage with that of two prior surveys using seine nets. Twenty fish taxa were observed in the current study, consisting of five families, two genera, and thirteen species. Several environmental factors emerged as significant influences on the presence and abundance of different fish taxa, especially individual pools. A comparison of CPUE between current and prior seine studies found an increase in forage fish taxa and a shift from taxa that prefer a range of habitats to mangrove specific taxa, indicating an increased ecological function of these mangroves as fish habitat."
416,964,"The composition and dynamics of the passerine bird community in a subalpine birch forest, Swedish Lapland. A 20-year study.","Over 20 yr the number of species appearing in the forest has shown a slightly increasing trend (average yearly addition: a third of a species) with Hippolais icterina as the most conspicuous new-comer. The dominant Phylloscopus trochilus has shown a steadily decreasing trend over the last 18 yr. Average community density is 400 territories/km2 with 260 and 550 as the extreme values (coefficient of variation 19%). The finding that species with similar migration and wintering strategies tend to fluctuate in a similar way indicates that factors operating outside the breeding season have been important in generating the fluctuation patterns of the breeding populations. Only Carduelis flammea and Fringilla montifringilla have responded clearly to recorded breeding area factors, namely superabundant birch seed crop and mass outbreak of the geometric moth Epirrita autumnata, respectively. The investigated bird community does not appear to be saturated.-from Authors"
417,1367,Stochastic population dynamics and time to extinction of a declining population of barn swallows,"1. Time to extinction was predicted for a declining population of barn swallow Hirundo rustica in Denmark, using a model that includes demographic as well as environmental stochasticity and that takes the uncertainties in the parameter estimates into account. 2. We apply the concept of population prediction interval (PPI), which is a stochastic interval that includes the unknown variable that may be the extinction time or the population size at some future point of time, with a given probability (1-α). 3. The lower bound of the upper one-sided prediction interval for the extinction time for α=0.10 was 22 years. 4. Ignoring uncertainties in the parameter estimates led to a 41% increase in this statistic. 5. Although the estimate of the demographic variance was small compared to other passerines (σd2=0.180), a sensitivity analysis showed that it strongly influenced the predicted time to extinction compared to the model ignoring demographic stochasticity. A similar effect on the prediction of the time to extinction was found for the environmental variance σe2. In addition, choosing σe2=0 strongly reduced the width of the prediction interval. 6. This demonstrates that reliable population projections require modelling of the environmental as well as the demographic stochasticity, and that the uncertainty in the estimates of the model parameters must be taken into account."
418,3065,The effects of isolation on the demography and genetic diversity of long-lived species: implications for conservation and management of the Gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus),"In the southeastern United States, habitat loss has fragmented the landscape and isolated many populations of; this regions flora and fauna, which has presumably resulted in smaller population sizes and reduced levels of genetic; diversity. For example, forestry practices and anthropogenic disturbances are both cited as factors fragmenting the once; extensive range of Gopherus polyphemus. One localized, but extreme, source of fragmentation was the impoundment of; the Chattahoochee River in 1963 to form Walter F. George Reservoir along the border of Georgia and Alabama. The; formation of this reservoir isolated populations of G. polyphemus on two newly created islands providing a natural; laboratory to explore the demographics and genetic effects of fragmentation on a longlived species. These populations; were first surveyed in 1984 and, 21 years later, we revisited them to collect demographic data and tissue samples for; genetic analysis. We genotyped all individuals for 10 microsatellite loci, and we tested these data for bottlenecks and; compared them to levels of genetic diversity for populations from other portions of the range. We found 45 and two; individuals on the larger and smaller islands, respectively. On the large island, however, the population size was identical; to the 1984 survey. Only the population structure based on estimated age differed between the 1984 and 2004 surveys,; while population size structure based on carapace length, sex ratio, and sex-specific growth rates did not differ. The; population of the large island showed genetic evidence of a past bottleneck. The genetic diversity indices from the; population of the large island, however, were comparable to or greater than those found at mainland sites, in particular; from western populations."
419,880,Status and distribution of the Pemba flying fox Pteropus voeltzkowi.,"The Pemba flying fox Pteropus voeltzkowi is a fruit bat endemic to the island of Pemba, off Tanzania. A total of 41 reported roosting areas were visited in June and July 1995, and 19 occupied roosts were located, most of them in the west of the island, and on small islets off the west and south of Pemba. Roosts were situated in primary forest, secondary forest (overgrown clove plantations), traditional graveyards and mangrove areas. A range of sizes and species of trees were used as roosts. The minimum population of P. voeltzkowi was estimated to be between 4600 and 5500 individuals. In total 94 per cent of the population was located at 10 roost sites. Larger colonies were associated with roosts located in forests, which together supported 75 per cent of the total bat population. Colonies were of mixed sex, but no young or obviously pregnant females were observed. Major threats to this species appeared to be limiting and deforestation (both logging and clearing for agriculture) and P. voeltzkowi is considered to be endangered."

422,1305,Demography and Dynamics of a Stoat Mustela erminea Population in a Diverse Community of vertebrates,"Mean-density in autumn varied between 0.3-1.0 stoats per 10 ha. Local and beween-year differences in density followed variations in the stoats' reproductive output and was related to local differences in food supply (water voles). Winter mortality rate was c.50% in all years, irrespective of stoat density in autumn. The highest age recorded for males was 4.5 yr and for females 3.5 yr. Sex ratios for each year did not deviate statistically from 50:50, but males tended to outnumber females during years of population decline. Data strongly indicated that the stoat population was limited by a shortage of food caused by interspecific competition: 1) c. 90% of the stoats' basic food (field voles and water voles) was exploited by competitors, especially some generalist predators; the calculated total consumption of field voles by predators equalled the calculated annual production; 2) heavy losses due to the predators throughout winter resulted in low vole densities every spring; 3) continued intense interspecific competition for voles in spring and early summer resulted in a food shortage for breeding female stoats. A marked decrease in rabbits, the food of primary importance for several generalist predators, caused a change in the generalists' diet and increased competition for voles. This probably was the primary cause of a marked decrease in stoat numbers.-from Author"

424,2539,Influence of weather and population characteristics of free-ranging Spanish ibex in the Sierra de Cazorla y Segura and in the eastern Sierra Nevada,"Some parameters are given of the structures of two Spanish ibex populations in the Sierra de Cazorla y Segura and in the eastern Sierra Nevada during the rut (November-December) and post-calving periods from 1982 to 1988. A higher reproductive index, increased juvenil survival, less variable fluctuations in numbers were observed in the eastern Sierra Nevada. This can be correlated with the lower density (2 in km2) compared with the 11 km2 in the Sierras de Cazorla y Segura. This follows the predictions of large-mammal population models, which postulates that density-dependent food limitation occurs at densities near the ecological carrying capacity. In spite of the high adult male mortality usual in most ungulate populations, the sex ratio remained in balance most years in the areas studied. This was probably due to the lower rate of survival found among female young. A significant correlation was found in both the Sierras de Cazorla y Segura and the Sierra Nevada populations between the annual precipitation and kid production and survival of the young (from 6-18 mths), the correlation being closer where population densities were higher (Sierra de Cazorla y Segura population). The negative correlation observed between the spring/summer precipitation and the kid to female ratio during the rut period is probably due to perinatal mortality caused by the weather. "
425,3062,"Population status of the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) in El Cajón reservoir, Honduras","During 2005 and 2007, we examined status of populations of the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) in three rivers at El Cajon Reservoir in central Honduras. Number of crocodiles per kilometer of survey varied by river and time of study. Most observations were of hatchlings and yearlings, but juveniles, subadults, and adults also were observed. Sex ratio in the reservoir was 1:1.4 male:female. Assuming that sex ratio and size-class structure were representative of the overall population, our study suggests that the population in El Cajon Reservoir is stable."
426,650,Downward trends in Ngorongoro Crater ungulate populations 1986-2005: Conservation concerns and the need for ecological research,"The concentration of over 25,000 ungulates inside Ngorongoro Crater on a 250 km2 patch of the African plains was a major reason for designating the Ngorongoro Conservation Area as a World Heritage Site in 1979. As one of East Africa's premier tourist attractions, it is also a major source of foreign exchange for Tanzania. This paper reports the decline of populations of wildebeest, Thomson's and Grant's gazelles since the mid-1980s and the rise to dominance of the buffalo, the results of research carried out from 1996 to 2000 on the Crater ungulates, and discusses natural and anthropogenic factors that may be linked to the population changes. Samples comparing young:adult female ratios in Ngorongoro and Serengeti populations indicated higher survival rates of Crater wildebeest and zebra young, and lower survival rates of Thomson's gazelle. The possibility that predation by lions and spotted hyenas was responsible for reductions in the ungulate populations is belied by corresponding declines in the number of predators. Further research in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area is urgently needed to increase understanding of this complex ecosystem and promote effective stewardship, not only of Ngorongoro Crater but of the Serengeti ecosystem, of which the NCA is an integral part, comprising an International Biosphere Reserve. Our recommendations include establishment of a scientific advisory board and a research center that would attract and accommodate Tanzanian and foreign scientists. "
427,1670,Inbreeding and Loss of Genetic Variation in a Reintroduced Population of Mauritius Kestrel,"Many populations have recovered from severe bottlenecks either naturally or through intensive conservation management. In the past, however, few conservation programs have monitored the genetic health of recovering populations. We conducted a conservation genetic assessment of a small, reintroduced population of Mauritius Kestrel (Falco punctatus) to determine whether genetic deterioration has occurred since its reintroduction. We used pedigree analysis that partially accounted for individuals of unknown origin to document that (1) inbreeding occurred frequently (2.6% increase per generation; NeI = 18.9), (2) 25% of breeding pairs were composed of either closely or moderately related individuals, (3) genetic diversity has been lost from the population (1.6% loss per generation; NeV = 32.1) less rapidly than the corresponding increase in inbreeding, and (4) ignoring the contribution of unknown individuals to a pedigree will bias the metrics derived from that pedigree, ultimately obscuring the prevailing genetic dynamics. The rates of inbreeding and loss of genetic variation in the subpopulation of Mauritius Kestrel we examined were extreme and among the highest yet documented in a wild vertebrate population. Thus, genetic deterioration may affect this population's long-term viability. Remedial conservation strategies are needed to reduce the impact of inbreeding and loss of genetic variation in this species. We suggest that schemes to monitor genetic variation after reintroduction should be an integral component of endangered species recovery programs. "
428,3967,Long-term decline of a winter-resident bird community in Puerto Rico,"Despite concern expressed two decades ago, there has been little recent discussion about continuing declines of migrant bird populations. Monitoring efforts have been focused almost exclusively on the breeding grounds. We describe the long-term decline of a winter-resident bird population in Gua´nica Commonwealth Forest, Puerto Rico, one of the last remaining tracts of high-quality tropical dry forests in the Caribbean. The winter bird community has exhibited dramatic declines, with constant-effort mist netting now capturing about one-third as many birds as it did 20 years ago. Population estimates for the three most common species have declined dramatically, even though survival rates have remained constant, and other species are now virtually absent from a site where they once were fairly common. Although explanations for these declines are speculative, particularly because they involve multiple species, we argue that the strength and duration of these declines in well-preserved dry forest within a biosphere reserve should stimulate renewed discussion of migrant population trends and comparison with other recent monitoring activities."
429,1582,Voles and lemmings: chaos and uncertainty in fluctuating populations,"Turchin provided point estimates of the dominant Lyapunov exponent suggesting that chaos occurs in microtines north of 60° N. Falck et al. proposed to use bootstrapping methodology to investigate the uncertainty associated with the reported estimates. Based on this, Falck et al. found no reason to conclude that the northern populations are chaotic. The methodology employed, and the conclusions reached, were criticized by Turchin. Here we discuss the critique as well as analyse the new data set introduced by Turchin. In addition to analysing pooled data for all microtines at seventeen localities (as Turchin does), we also analyse data for each species at the sites separately. As an integral part of our response, we address some fundamental statistical and biological issues. We reach the same conclusion as earlier: there is no statistical evidence to conclude that northern microtine populations are characterized by chaotic dynamics."
430,2365,Biodiversity changes in the lakes of the central Yangtze,"The Central Yangtze ecoregion in China includes a number of lakes, but these have been greatly affected by human activities over the past several decades, resulting in severe loss of biodiversity. In this paper, we document the present distribution of the major lakes and the changes in size that have taken place over the past 50 years, using remote sensing data and historical observations of land cover in the region. We also provide an overview of the changes in species richness, community composition, population size and age structure, and individual body size of aquatic plants, fishes, and waterfowl in these lakes. The overall species richness of aquatic plants found in eight major lakes has decreased substantially during the study period. Community composition has also been greatly altered, as have population size and age and individual body size in some species. These changes are largely attributed to the integrated effects of lake degradation, the construction of large hydroelectric dams, the establishment of nature reserves, and lake restoration practices.

The six commonest species were: Anas platyrhynchos, Anser albifrons, Anser fabalis, Anser; anser, Anas crecca and Fulica atra. During the ten-year period there were 8 species with about 1000; individuals or less (Anser erythropus, Mergus albellus, Tachybaptus ruficollis, Phalacrocorax; pygmeus, Netta rufina, Podiceps nigricollis, Cygnus olor, Mergus merganser).

433,3724,"Trends in autumn counts of migratory raptors in northeastern North America, 1974-2004","Hourly counts of migrating raptors have been collected for ?10 years at >20 raptor migration watchsites in eastern North America. Using counts from seven watch sites with ?30 years of counts, we calculated annual population indexes for 16 species of diurnal migrant raptors. The seven watchsites were at similar latitudes along an east-to-west transect from the Atlantic coastline of Connecticut to the western shoreline of Lake Superior. We also calculated population indexes for a shorter-term count at Observatoire doiseaux de Tadoussac, which receives migrants primarily from northeastern Québec and Newfoundland. We estimated geometric rates of change in the population indexes for the 16 species. Counts increased or remained stable for seven species and decreased for one species throughout the region from 1974 to 2004. Eight other species showed variable long-term trends across the region. Precision of long-term trend estimates from migration monitoring was generally good (n = 107), with 45 estimates rated with high (95% confi dence interval [95% CI], ± 1.8% per year or less), 51 moderate (95% CI ± 1.83.5% per year), and 11 low (95% CI ± >3.5% per year) precision. Trends often were not linear, and several species that increased signifi cantly during the 1980sOsprey (Pandion haliaetus), Merlin (Falco columbarius), Peregrine Falcon (F. peregrinus)did not do so in the 1990s. A few species showed geographic patterns in trends, which suggests either that different source populations were monitored in the eastern and western portions of the study area or that migration geography changed over the course of the study period."
434,3954,A new bully on the block: Does urbanization promote Bewick’s wren (Thryomanes bewickii) aggressive exclusion of Pacific wrens (Troglodytes pacificus)?,"Human conversion of land cover alters biotic communities and sets the stage for ongoing change as species interact within new environments. We studied the response of a native forest specialist, the Pacific wren (Troglodytes pacificus), to immediate and ongoing environmental changes facilitated by urbanization. We found evidence of a synergistic effect of native land cover loss followed by increased aggressive interactions with a native generalist, the Bewick's wren (Thryomanes bewickii), resulting in the decline of Pacific wrens in urbanizing environments. Pacific wren relative abundance decreased dramatically during and after development, while Bewick's wrens increased and persisted at greater abundance post-relative to pre-development. Breeding territories of the two species overlapped minimally, suggesting spatial segregation either by differential resource use or territorial aggression. A comparison of territory characteristics revealed the species generally used different resources, although territory composition was increasingly similar at urbanizing sites where the species co-occurred. Territorial playback experiments confirmed that the two species interact aggressively. Analyses of body size, body condition and reproductive success did not suggest Bewick's wrens negatively impact fitness of Pacific wrens at sites where they co-occurred. In established subdivisions (>10. years old) Bewick's wrens appear to limit the abundance of Pacific wrens, however this was not yet the case at sites we studied immediately after development. Although the results of this study are not conclusive, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that new environmental gradients and communities created by urbanization increase competitive interactions among native species.

435,2734,Long-term breeding demography and density dependence in an increasing population of Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos,"Few studies have quantified the dynamics of recovering populations of large raptors using long-term, spatially explicit studies. Using data collected over 37 years in the western Italian Alps, we assessed the trends in distribution, abundance, fecundity and breeding population structure of Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos. Using the spatial distribution of territory centroids in 2007, we found that the spatial distribution of eagle territories was over-dispersed up to 3 km. Although population size and total productivity increased from 1972 to 2008, the proportion of pairs that laid eggs showed a strong decline, falling to no more than 50% after 2003. On average, 15% of successful nests produced two fledglings, and productivity also declined over time. No significant relationship between population growth rate and total population size was detected, but the percentage of pairs that bred and breeding success showed evidence of density dependence, as they declined significantly with increasing density. Our results suggest that density dependence, operating across heterogeneous habitats, is currently regulating this population, while the carrying capacity may still be increasing. This may explain the apparent paradox of reduced breeding effort despite increasing total productivity."
436,3982,Cyclic dynamics of a boreal southern red-backed vole population in northwestern Quebec,"In Fennoscandia, red-backed vole populations (Myodes spp.) often show regular fluctuations of abundance of; 3- to 5-year periods.

We found that their density; fluctuated (up to 41-fold) with a cyclical pattern and 4-year periods. Our study is the first to demonstrate cyclic; dynamics in a southern red-backed vole population found in the boreal forest of North America. Regular pulse of; food or heavy predation may be responsible for the fluctuations of southern red-backed voles.

437,544,Status of the Pacific walrus population 1950-1989.,"The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) population is an important ecological and economic resource of the Bering Sea region. We describe population change, beginning with a low in 1950, through a high in about 1980, and ending in 1989. Estimates of abundance for the years after 1989 were not attempted due to the lack of harvest data and other population parameters. Selective hunting practices resulted in biased data regarding population composition and reproductive performance. Rates of reproduction had to be estimated from ovarian data, which indicated a dramatic drop in the 1980s. High harvests in the 1980s likely contributed to a decline in the population, but uncertainties as to accuracy of population estimates and other data raise reasonable doubts, especially with respect to the number of males, for which the most recent (1985) population estimate suggests a sharp decline. Past population estimates were revised upwards to compensate for walruses underwater and not seen in aerial surveys. The weaknesses in the available data make it clear that effective management of the population will require many improvements in collection of data regarding harvests, population structure, reproduction, and population trend."
438,3027,Photographic mark–recapture analysis of local dynamics within an open population of dolphins,"Identifying demographic changes is important for understanding population dynamics. However, this requires long-term studies of definable populations of distinct individuals, which can be particularly challenging when studying mobile cetaceans in the marine environment. We collected photo-identification data from 19 years (19922010) to assess the dynamics of a population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) restricted to the shallow (<7 m) waters of Little Bahama Bank, northern Bahamas. This population was known to range beyond our study area, so we adopted a Bayesian mixture modeling approach to markrecapture to identify clusters of individuals that used the area to different extents, and we specifically estimated trends in survival, recruitment, and abundance of a resident population with high probabilities of identification. There was a high probability (p=0.97) of a long-term decrease in the size of this resident population from a maximum of 47 dolphins (95% highest posterior density intervals, HPDI = 2961) in 1996 to a minimum of just 24 dolphins (95% HPDI = 1437) in 2009, a decline of 49% (95% HPDI = - 5% to -75%). This was driven by low per capita recruitment (average ~0.02) that could not compensate for relatively low apparent survival rates (average ~0.94). Notably, there was a significant increase in apparent mortality (~5 apparent mortalities vs. ~2 on average) in 1999 when two intense hurricanes passed over the study area, with a high probability (p = 0.83) of a drop below the average survival probability (~0.91 in 1999; ~0.94, on average). As such, our markrecapture approach enabled us to make useful inference about local dynamics within an open population of bottlenose dolphins; this should be applicable to other studies challenged by sampling highly mobile individuals with heterogeneous space use."
439,1493,Neotropical Primates in a Regenerating Costa Rican Dry Forest: A Comparison of Howler and Capuchin Population Patterns,"Few data exist on how primate populations return to regenerating tropical forests. We compare the ways that two populations of neotropical monkeys, Alouatta palliata and Cebus capucinus, expanded over a 28-year period after the establishment of Santa Rosa National Park on reclaimed ranchlands in Costa Rica. We found that both howler and capuchin populations increased substantially in size subsequent to protection, but the howler population grew faster. This is likely due to their faster-paced life-history pattern than that of capuchins. The howler population increased mainly via the establishment of many new groups, whereas the capuchins expanded mainly by increasing the size of existing groups. We related this finding to the fact that capuchins are limited largely by their need to drink from water holes during the dry seasons whereas howlers are limited principally by their preference for larger-sized trees that occur in older forests. Proportions of adult male capuchins increased significantly during our study, likely due to skewed sex ratio at birth or male-biased immigration into the protected park or both factors. Our main finding is that, in as short a time period as 28 years, we can substantially enhance the size of monkey populations by allowing the regeneration of tropical forest. Furthermore, we provide a preliminary interpretation of how extrinsic factors - deforestation, hunting, crop-spraying, destruction of the watershed - and intrinsic variables, e.g., pace of reproduction; diet, differentially affect not only each species' vulnerability to extinction but also its capacity to recover when human disturbances are minimized."
440,859,"Ecology and social structure of the Gobi khulan Equus hemionus subsp. in the Gobi B National Park, Mongolia.","The status of the Gobi khulan Equus hemionus subsp, is recorded as ""insufficiently known"" in the Species Survival Commission's Equid Action Plan. Recent counts confirm that Mongolia holds the most important population of the whole species. Since 1953, the animals have benefited from a protected status, but this is now challenged. A 5-year study in the B part of the Gobi National Park on one subpopulation showed that it has remained stable over the past 15 years with an adequate mean reproductive rate of 15% and a 50% survival rate over the first year. Age/sex related mortality and prey analysis indicate that wolf predation probably has some impact on the population, in particular for 4-6-year-olds of both sexes at the start of reproduction. Desert and mountain steppes are the khulan's year-round preferred habitat, but 'oases', play an important role at the beginning of lactation. Anthropogenic factors affect both home range and habitat use through direct intervention or permanent occupation of the scarce water sources, Khulans of this subpopulation, unlike other Asian and African wild asses, form year-round stable, non-territorial families. These families and all-male groups join together into ""bands"" in winter, and herds of several hundred animals, where reproductive rate is highest, form throughout the year. The existence of such herds may thus be critical for the breeding success of the population. Our study provides the first detailed quantitative data for this subspecies, which will help to monitor changes in the future. "
441,3719,"Aerial survey estimates of hauled-out ringed seal (Pusa hispida) density in western Hudson Bay, June 2009 and 2010","We conducted strip-transect surveys in June 2009 and 2010 to estimate density and abundance of Ringed Seals (Pusa hispida) in western Hudson Bay, Canada. Ringed Seal density has varied considerably over the 16-year period of aerial surveys. Recent survey results describe a decrease in Ringed Seal density from 1.06 seals/km2 in 2007, to 0.50 in 2008, and 0.28 in 2009, followed by an increase to 0.73 in 2010. However, estimates from 2009 should be considered cautiously due to an incomplete survey caused by poor weather and ice conditions. Our results add to a long time-series of Ringed Seal density and abundance in the Arctic. A declining, albeit not significant, trend in Ringed Seal density estimates in western Hudson Bay is evident over the past sixteen years based on results obtained from nine aerial surveys which include the 2009 and 2010 surveys. As Ringed Seals are considered to be a good indicator species of longterm changes, continued monitoring of population density will add to an understanding of biological mechanisms of population response to environmental forcing."
442,3439,Assessing different management scenarios to reverse the declining trend of a relict capercaillie population: a modelling approach within an adaptive management framework,"Capercaillie populations are declining in most of its distribution area and are especially vulnerable in southern Europe. There, the causes of decline have not been properly identified and conservation decisions are too frequently based on poor evidence. We analysed the trend of a relict capercaillie population in the Spanish Pyrenees on the basis of bird densities during the period 1989-2010, and we developed the first modelling exercise for the dynamics of a capercaillie population in southern Europe. We also explored management actions commonly used to enhance endangered prey species thought to be affected by hyperpredation: the release of captive-bred females, in varying numbers, the removal of predators and the combination of both actions, using available information from past captive-breeding experiments and from an ongoing experiment involving the removal of terrestrial mesopredators. The population was found to be declining at an annual rate of 4%. Restraining the unknown adult survival rate according to values reported in the literature, our modelling approach showed that recruitment (productivity. +. fledgling survival), rather than adult survival, was the demographic parameter to be improved as a result of management and, thus, most likely to increase the population growth rate. The removal of terrestrial mesocarnivores may lead to the stabilisation of the capercaillie population (lambda 0.99. ±. 0.06), through the improvement of productivity, although this result should be considered as preliminary. However, the most effective management strategy was the combination of predator removal together with the release of 15, 30 or 45 adult females per year. These strategies should be viewed as urgency measures and should be implemented in combination with other long-term measures, such as the reduction of forest density, which may influence predation rate and food availability, and the control of the numbers of wild ungulates, which could be subsidising mesopredators in the area. We also present the adaptive management framework which will allow the results obtained from our current modelling to be updated in the near future, what will reduce the uncertainty regarding the best conservation strategies to apply in this and other similar populations.

443,4480,Raja asterias population assessment in FAO GFCM GSA17 area,"Population structure and distribution of the starry ray, Raja asterias, were described based on data collected during yearly rapido trawl surveys (SoleMon), between 2005 and 2014 in the Northern and Central Adriatic Sea. A total of 306 individuals was caught, sex ratio was 1.04:1 in favor of males and length-weight relationships were obtained for the complete sample. Following the MEDITS scale, maturity was estimated, detecting a higher number of immature individuals. Relative abundance significantly increased during the last five years with the highest values recorded at 5-30 m depths. Such increase could be related to the response of R. asterias to climatic change or to the decrease in fishing pressure in the area. Clear spatial segregation of individuals depending upon their life stage was observed, with immature individuals inhabiting the coastal areas and adults being more abundant at depths greater than 40 m. Comparison of the results of the present study with MEDITS survey outcomes in terms of distribution patterns, persistence areas of adults and juveniles, and abundances indices, indicates that the SoleMon survey seems to be more suitable in defining such features of the stock, likely due to the greater catchability of the rapido trawl in respect to the MEDITS trawl net. However, further investigations are needed to identify factors affecting the increasing abundance of this species, and develop an action plan for spatial management of fishing activities."
444,3032,"Population structure of the leopard coralgrouper, Plectropomus leopardus, on fished and unfished reefs off Townsville, Central Great Barrier Reef, Australia","Samples of Plectropomusleopardus collected at two reefs (Glow and Yankee) that have been closed to fishing since 1987 were compared with samples collected at two reefs (Grub and Hopkinson) that were open to fishing to investigate the effects of a 3--4 year closure on the size, age, and sex structure of leopard coralgrouper (also known as ~coral trout"") populations. There were no significant differences in mean size and age between protected reefs and unprotected reefs. However, mean size and age varied significantly between the two protected and the two unprotected reefs. In the two reefs closed to fishing the population structure was dominated by the presence of a strong year class which settled in early 1984, indicating the occurrence of strong interannual fluctuations in recruitment. A similar pattern was not observed on the reefs; open to fishing, suggesting that fishing mortality may have caused the decrease in abundance ofthis strong year class on the open reefs. Sex change occurred over a wide range of sizes and ages on the four reefs. A comparison of the frequency of developmental stages between reefs indicated significant variation. The two unprotected reefs had a smaller proportion of males, but that seemed to be compensated for by; a larger proportion oftransitional-stage fish and young males. Although the distribution of developmental stages in the populations was different, the same final female: male balance was achieved. This suggests that for the leopard coralgrouper, sex change results from a combination of developmental and behavioral processes. Differences in age structure were more obvious than differences in the size structure between closed and open reefs, suggesting that age structure may be far more useful than size structure for comparisons of fishing effects on long-lived fishes such as Epinephelinae serranids. Comparisons of open and closed reefs based solely on mean sizes may fail to detect important differences."
445,3790,Marsupial population dynamics in a tropical rainforest: intraspecific competition and nonlinear effect of rainfall,"Population fluctuations are the result of the combined action of endogenous (feedback structure) and exogenous factors (large- and local-scale climate variables). In this paper, we used a 13-year time series to identify the feedback structure in a population of the brown 4-eyed opossum Metachirus nudicaudatus and to test a hypothesis on the effects of El Niño Southern Oscillation and rainfall using Royamas theoretical framework. Metachirus nudicaudatus was regulated by a strong 1st-order negative feedback, with intraspecific competition for food resources as the probable factor governing the endogenous system. Contrary to our expectations, El Niño did not explain the marsupial dynamics better than 1-year lagged rainfall, that may operate in 2 different manners: as a nonlinear perturbation effect influencing the strength of density dependence (intraspecific competition and intraguild predation) or as a lateral perturbation effect influencing the carrying capacity of the environment."
446,3963,Seasonal dynamics with compensatory effects regulate populations of tropical forest marsupials: a 16-year study,"The conditions that a population experiences during one season can affect the strength of density; dependence in the following season. In the tropics, many populations face their biggest challenges in the dry season due to limited food and cold-dry conditions. Seasonal environmental changes can be especially problematic for small, short-lived, seasonally breeding endotherms. To investigate the effects of seasonality on population dynamics, we studied five marsupial species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, using a 16-year dataset. We tested if (1) compensatory density feedback is stronger in the dry season, due to the high population sizes and limited food; (2) lower temperatures and the overall abundance of small mammals negatively affect dry season population growth rates; and (3) rainfall, a proxy for food availability, is positively related to wet season population growth rates. Population growth rates were regressed against seasonal population sizes and exogenous variables, and analyzed with linear autoregressive models. Seasonal compensatory density feedback occurred in both seasons, with compensation processes in just one season being sufficient to allow population persistence. Rainfall and the overall abundance of small mammals had little influence on populations, while colder temperatures decreased population growth rate of smaller species in both seasons. Although the study marsupials share similar life histories and phylogeny, they varied with respect to the season when compensatory density feedback was strongest. Our results demonstrate that seasonality plays a key role in driving marsupial population dynamics, and highlight the need to account for seasonality in demographic studies even in tropical environments."
447,3821,Anthropogenic Influences on Conservation Values of White Rhinoceros,"White rhinoceros (rhinos) is a keystone conservation species and also provides revenue for protection agencies. Restoring or mimicking the outcomes of impeded ecological processes allows reconciliation of biodiversity and financial objectives. We evaluate the consequences of white rhino management removal, and in recent times, poaching, on population persistence, regional conservation outcomes and opportunities for revenue generation. In Kruger National Park, white rhinos increased from 1998 to 2008. Since then the population may vary non-directionally. In 2010, we estimated 10,621 (95% CI: 8,76712,682) white rhinos using three different population estimation methods. The desired management effect of a varying population was detectable after 2008. Age and sex structures in sink areas (focal rhino capture areas) were different from elsewhere. This comes from relatively more sub-adults being removed by managers than what the standing age distribution defined. Poachers in turn focused on more adults in 2011. Although the effect of poaching was not detectable at the population level given the confidence intervals of estimates, managers accommodated expected poaching annually and adapted management removals. The present poaching trend predicts that 432 white rhinos may be poached in Kruger during 2012. The white rhino management model mimicking outcomes of impeded ecological processes predicts 397 rhino management removals are required. At present poachers may be doing management removals, but conservationists have no opportunity left to contribute to regional rhino conservation strategies or generate revenue through white rhino sales. In addition, continued trends in poaching predict detectable white rhino declines in Kruger National Park by 2016. Our results suggest that conservationists need innovative approaches that reduce financial incentives to curb the threats that poaching poses to several conservation values of natural resources such as white rhinos."
448,3825,"Disruption of Rhino Demography by Poachers May Lead to Population Declines in Kruger National Park, South Africa","The onslaught on the Worlds rhinoceroses continues despite numerous initiatives aimed at curbing it. When losses due to poaching exceed birth rates, declining rhino populations result. We used previously published estimates and growth rates for black rhinos (2008) and white rhinos (2010) together with known poaching trends at the time to predict population sizes and poaching rates in Kruger National Park, South Africa for 2013. Kruger is a stronghold for the south-eastern black rhino and southern white rhino. Counting rhinos on 878 blocks 3x3 km in size using helicopters, estimating availability bias and collating observer and detectability biases allowed estimates using the Jollys estimator. The exponential escalation in number of rhinos poached per day appears to have slowed. The black rhino estimate of 414 individuals (95% confidence interval: 343-487) was lower than the predicted 835 individuals (95% CI: 754-956). The white rhino estimate of 8,968 individuals (95% CI: 8,394-9,564) overlapped with the predicted 9,417 individuals (95% CI: 7,698-11,183). Density- and rainfall-dependent responses in birth- and death rates of white rhinos provide opportunities to offset anticipated poaching effects through removals of rhinos from high density areas to increase birth and survival rates. Biological management of rhinos, however, need complimentary management of the poaching threat as present poaching trends predict detectable declines in white rhino abundances by 2018. Strategic responses such as anti-poaching that protect supply from illegal harvesting, reducing demand, and increasing supply commonly require crime network disruption as a first step complimented by providing options for alternative economies in areas abutting protected areas."
449,1891,Non-independence of demographic parameters: positive density-dependent fecundity in eagles,"1. Using information on the Doñana population of Spanish imperial eagles Aquila adalberti from 1959 to 2004, we present strong empirical support to theoretical models on the regulation of population trajectories by the relationships between breeder mortality and floater availability. 2. During the study period, the eagle population showed three distinct phases: (i) a population increase with negative density-dependent fecundity; (ii) a period of stability without any relationship between density and fecundity; and (iii) a population decrease with a positive relationship between density and fecundity. 3. A dramatic increase in annual adult mortality due to an increase in poisoning in hunting areas surrounding the Doñana National Park was recorded. The use of poison against generalist predators accounted for more than 54% of the total number of breeding eagles found dead since 1990, increasing annual adult mortality from 6.07 to 12.01%. 4. This high mortality reduced the population annually by 6% during the 1992-2004 period. Also, the population changed from a negative to a positive relationship between density and fecundity (Allee effect). These trends made the population approach extinction due to the double effect of increasing breeder mortality and low availability of floaters. 5. A supplementary feeding programme established in 1990 did not increase fecundity because it was a consequence of high adult mortality rather than low food availability. The high mortality of adults increased the risk of breeding failure and also decreased the availability of floaters, decreasing the likelihood of mate substitution. 6. Synthesis and applications. The main target in species conservation management plans is often a single demographic parameter (typically, fecundity in raptor populations). Our research demonstrates, however, that demographic parameters must not be considered as independent variables when formulating management programmes. The essential relationship between adult mortality and the availability of floaters must be better understood to avoid the risk of implementing inefficient management strategies. Although fecundity was low in this eagle population, it was a result of high adult mortality rates. Consequently, management must aim to correct the unusual mortality and recover the floater population. "
450,1898,Loss of large predatory sharks from the Mediterranean Sea,"Evidence for severe declines in large predatory fishes is increasing around the world. Because of its long history of intense fishing, the Mediterranean Sea offers a unique perspective on fish population declines over historical timescales. We used a diverse set of records dating back to the early 19th and mid 20th century to reconstruct long-term population trends of large predatory sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. We compiled 9 time series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records. Generalized linear models were used to extract instantaneous rates of change from each data set, and a meta-analysis was conducted to compare population trends. Only 5 of the 20 species we considered had sufficient records for analysis. Hammerhead (Sphyrna spp.), blue (Prionace glauca), mackerel (Isurus oxyrinchus and Lamna nasus), and thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus) declined between 96 and 99.99% relative to their former abundance. According to World Conservation Union (IUCN) criteria, these species would be considered critically endangered. So far, the lack of quantitative population assessments has impeded shark conservation in the Mediterranean Sea. Our study fills this critical information gap, suggesting that current levels of exploitation put large sharks at risk of extinction in the Mediterranean Sea. Possible ecosystem effects of these losses involve a disruption of top-down control and a release of midlevel consumers."
451,2550,Patterns and ecosystem consequences of shark declines in the ocean,"Whereas many land predators disappeared before their ecological roles were studied, the decline of marine apex predators is still unfolding. Large sharks in particular have experienced rapid declines over the last decades. In this study, we review the documented changes in exploited elasmobranch communities in coastal, demersal, and pelagic habitats, and synthesize the effects of sharks on their prey and wider communities. We show that the high natural diversity and abundance of sharks is vulnerable to even light fishing pressure. The decline of large predatory sharks reduces natural mortality in a range of prey, contributing to changes in abundance, distribution, and behaviour of small elasmobranchs, marine mammals, and sea turtles that have few other predators. Through direct predation and behavioural modifications, top-down effects of sharks have led to cascading changes in some coastal ecosystems. In demersal and pelagic communities, there is increasing evidence of mesopredator release, but cascading effects are more hypothetical. Here, fishing pressure on mesopredators may mask or even reverse some ecosystem effects. In conclusion, large sharks can exert strong top-down forces with the potential to shape marine communities over large spatial and temporal scales. Yet more empirical evidence is needed to test the generality of these effects throughout the ocean."
452,112,Effects of litter size and population dynamics on juvenile and maternal survival in columbian ground squirrels.,"For Spermophilus columbianus in SW Alberta, a population increase during the first 4 yr was characterized by larger litter size, greater adult female body weight and greater survival than in the last 4 yr, during which the population decreased. During the increase phase, modal litter size at emergence from the natal burrow was four, and the number of juveniles surviving to the following spring increased with litter size. During the decrease, modal litter size was three, and juveniles in large litters experienced high mortality. Maternal survival was independent of litter size during the increase phase, but declined for litters larger than three in the decrease phase. -from Authors"
453,4368,"Rapid response of a long-lived species to improved water and grazing management: The case of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in the Camargue, France","Among human activities, the effect of habitat management by grazing on population viability is ambiguous. Indeed, beneficial effects of grazing are expected by maintaining open meadows, but overgrazing is supposed to increase mortality by trampling. Grazing has been shown to negatively impact the survival of European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in the Camargue. Consequently, a new management plan was defined. We investigated the consequences of this management using capture-recapture methods to estimate variations of population sizes in this managed site and a control site over a 17 years period. Results show an increase of the number of adults and juveniles on the managed site after the management change. Our results suggest that improved water management with flooding in autumn provided better hibernation conditions, and that reduced grazing intensity in autumn/winter likely decreased the risk of trampling. Population size significantly increased in less than 4 years following the management change, probably by the relaxation of density-dependence. It is an original result for a long lived-species supposed to have an important time of resilience to perturbations. "
454,4406,Modelling the dynamics of the deepwater shark Centroscymnus coelolepis off mainland Portugal,"A statistical approach to evaluate the temporal trends in the abundance of female Centroscymnus coelolepis in Portuguese waters of ICES division IXa is presented. A state space model is used, which integrates all the available information of the species’ life history as well as knowledge of its biological dynamics. The model involves two processes that run in parallel: a non-observed process (the state process) that describes the annual female population abundance and an observational process of annual fisheries catches in numbers, assumed to be measured with error. Estimation is done within the Bayesian paradigm using sequential importance sampling with resampling. To evaluate the sensitivity of the model to the prior distributions chosen for the parameters, three scenarios with different levels of prior information were considered. Trends in population abundance level and the abundance levels themselves are quite similar in the two scenarios using biological information, but the model that incorporated all the available biological information in the priors provided the best fit to the observed data. The results indicate that taking into account the main biological drivers and the fishing information in the same state space model provides a coherent picture of the population abundance trends, further suggesting that the fishing impact on the population inhabiting Portuguese mainland waters was low.

455,4519,Specific features of the formation of the year-class abundance of northeastern Arctic haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus during the warming of the Barents Sea,": Factors that influence the survival rate of northeastern Arctic haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus at different stages of the formation of the year-class abundance are considered. It is shown that the patterns of the formation of the year-class abundance of haddock have changed due to warming in the Barents Sea. Since the late 1990s, an enhancement of the relationship is recorded between the year-class numbers at the 0-group stage and at age 3 years. The mortality of this fry during the first two wintering periods has lost its dominant value for the emergence of strong year-classes. Under these conditions, the predation role of cod Gadus morhua as a regulator of the abundance of haddock demersal juveniles increased. This is due to the fact that the increase in water temperature in the Barents Sea provides favorable conditions for the abundance growth not only for haddock but also for its main predator, i.e., cod."
456,2241,"Changes in community composition, habitats and abundance of snakes over 10+ years in a protected area in Italy: conservation implications","The snake fauna of different habitat types was studied in a protected Mediterranean area of central Italy ('Canale Monterano' in the Tolfa Mountains, province of Rome) during the period from August 2002 to September 2003. The collected data were compared to those collected at the same study area over 10 years before, and published by Luiselli & Rugiero (1990). We captured eight different species (seven colubrids and one viper), six of which were observed in the earlier study. During both surveys, the most common species was Coluber viridiflavus, followed by Vipera aspis. In the 2002-2003 survey there was a slight increase in the value of the species diversity index but a remarkable increase in the value of species dominance index (due especially to the proportional higher abundance of C. viridiflavus). We used multivariate statistics, Pianka and Czechanowski overlap indices and Monte Carlo simulations on the habitat use states during the two survey periods to document whether the various species modified their habitat preferences between surveys. In terms of habitat preferences, all these indicators showed that there were substantial interspecific differences but that the species-specific preferences remained the same over the two survey periods. There was a decrease in the abundance of Elaphe longissima and, to a lesser degree, V. aspis, caused especially by clearing brush at an archaeological site where these snakes were very common over 10 years ago. This is potentially relevant in conservation terms, as in places such as Europe, where many of the protected areas are set aside for archaeological or historical (as opposed to biological) reasons, management to maintain sites or improve access may be detrimental to native species. The various habitats differed in their conservation value for snakes. Appropriate management of the 'dry-stone walls and oak forests' habitat-mosaic appeared especially important for the conservation of this snake community, and the same may well be true for many other areas in Mediterranean central Italy."
457,781,"Decreases in ungulate population densities. Examples from the Comoe National Park, Ivory Coast","In the Comoé National Park, Ivory Coast, there has been a tremendous decrease in all larger mammal species between 1978 and 1998. We document the degree of this decrease for the 11 most abundant ungulate species by comparing density estimates from two earlier studies undertaken in 1978 and 1984 with our own results from 1995 and 1998. Within the last 20 years all species included in the analysis experienced decreases between 60% and more than 90%. The species that suffered most were the duikers and other small antelopes up to the size of the kob antelope (Kobus kob kob). The larger decline of the smaller species also resulted in changes of the ungulate community, which in turn might affect other taxa such as large carnivores, and the entire ecosystem. The observed decreases can most likely be attributed to intensive poaching that occurred and still occurs throughout the park. Future conservation measures will hopefully stop this. "
458,657,Population dynamics and survival of an endangered wallaby: A comparison of four methods,"The bridled nailtail wallaby Onychogalea fraenata is a critically endangered marsupial, now restricted to a single locality in central Queensland, eastern Australia. Its small size and its nocturnal, solitary, and cryptic behavior present problems for monitoring of population dynamics. The population apparently declined during a major drought between 1991 and 1995, when juvenile survival was low. We carried out a detailed demographic analysis from 1994 to 1997 in order to estimate survival and abundance in two different habitats, using mark-recapture, mark-resight, radio-tagging, and line-transect methods. The finite rate of increase (λ) and its sensitivity to changes in survival and reproduction of each age class-were also calculated using a matrix population projection model. We then assessed biases and the value of each method for management. For data other than those based on radio-tagging data, population size and survival estimates were negatively biased and had large confidence limits. Line-transect estimates were likely to be the least biased. The reasons were that probabilities of capture and sighting varied among sexes, sites, and times; habitat use varied according to vegetation conditions; and the populations were small. Despite this, all methods indicated an increasing population size. The projected value of λ based on radio-tagging data was most sensitive to adult survival. Vegetation conditions improved throughout the study after an initial drought, and the mean projected intrinsic rate of increase was 28% per year. We conclude that management should aim to increase adult survival via predator control and that line-transect estimation is the most appropriate long-term monitoring method."
459,2576,Phenology of a lizard assemblage in the dry Chaco of Argentina,"Individual species' phenologies can play an important role in the structure of lizard assemblages over short time scales. Data from a pitfall study carried out in the dry Chaco of Argentina were used to address the question of how species are distributed in their assemblage through time. Lizard activity and species richness were highest in the spring breeding season and declined in the cool months of the year. Variations in seasonal activity patterns and reproductive chronology resulted in significantly different distributions of species in every sample month. Not only did the species composition of the assemblage change through time, but the mean size of lizards and the proportions of males, females, and juveniles varied significantly for several species. Large lizards, regardless of species, disappeared from the assemblage during the cool, dry winter, while juveniles of the large species remained active year round. Adults of the smallest species were also active throughout the year. We propose an hypothesis based on thermoregulatory constraints of lizard body size to account for these patterns. An approach focusing on the energetics and physiological ecology of individual species would be fruitful in understanding the dynamics of fluctuating lizard communities."
460,1930,Adult survivorship and capture probability of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina),"There are currently few harvest regulations for the Common Snapping Turtle (Chelydra serpentina) in West Virginia. Uncontrolled harvest of long-lived species with delayed sexual maturity may lead to long-term declines in populations. We analyzed a 17-year data set from a mark-recapture study on an unharvested population of the Common Snapping Turtle in Canaan Valley, West Virginia. We captured 91 snapping turtles (47 female, 44 male). Program MARK was used to analyze 10 competing models predicting adult Common Snapping Turtle survival and capture probabilities and compared the models using Akaike Information Criterion values corrected for small sample size (AICc). The estimated annual survival was 0.97 and the annual capture probability was 0.11. We found that the best performing model involved constant survival and capture probability that varied based on the mass at initial capture. This suggests that there is no difference in survival between males and females. Moreover, the size of trap may affect the capture of smaller and larger individuals and researchers should use multiple trap types to assess turtle abundance"
461,1345,Distance sampling effectively monitored a declining population of Italian roe deer Capreolus capreolus italicus,"Monitoring rare species of wild ungulates is critical for their conservation management. The Italian roe deer Capreolus capreolus italicus was recently confirmed to be a subspecies in Mediterranean habitats of central and southern Italy. We have monitored this subspecies at Castelporziano, near Rome, since 1988, and detected an abrupt population decline in 2001. We compared distance sampling surveys undertaken before and after the population crash to determine the ability of this method to detect variations in animal density and to investigate which factors may influence the precision of the estimates. We used radio tagged roe deer to evaluate the accuracy of our surveys, comparing distance sampling and mark-resight estimates at the same site, and studying the behavioural reaction of the animals to the presence of an observer. We found that before the crash distance sampling surveys attained a good precision but that the survey conditions influenced both precision and accuracy. Post-crash surveys were less precise, but the difference in density, before and after the crash was highly significant, indicating the potential of the method to quickly detect density variations and so to allow wildlife managers to react without delay to a crisis. The direct test of distance sampling assumptions showed that estimates were almost unbiased. We conclude that the methodology was successful for monitoring this population and that it may be used in other situations where ungulates are rare and efficient monitoring must be attained with restricted budgets.

462,2468,The population modelling of fallow deer and wild boar in a Mediterranean ecosystem,"The population ecology of ungulates in Mediterranean ecosystems is as yet poorly documented. This study is based on 5-year counts of fallow deer (Dama dama) and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Since the counts of ungulates in woodlands are usually quite difficult, biased and unprecise, independent methods were used to check their reliability and estimates of the vital rates were derived from the field data. Age-structured models were constructed with environmental randomness and density-dependence for the wild boar, because this species seems to be more deeply influenced by environmental factors than fallow deer. For the former species, the study showed, by simulation, that a mixed harvesting policy (constant effort plus fixed escapement) may work better than other, more commonly used, approaches. The results presented here are relevant for management and conservation of wild ungulate populations in Italy and in other Mediterranean countries."
463,1244,Status of the Mediterranean monk seal Monachus monachus in the western Sahara and the implications of a mass mortality event.,"The largest aggregation of the highly endangered Mediterranean monk seals Monachus monachus is located on the Cap Blanc Peninsula on the coast of the western Sahara. Photographic identification of individuals was used in a capture-recapture analysis to estimate the abundance and composition of the colony during 1993 to 1998. Results of the application of these techniques to Mediterranean monk seals were satisfactory, and allowed independent annual population estimates. No significant trends in abundance over the period 1993 to 1996 were detected, and the mean estimate for the period was 317 seals (CV = 0.16; 95% CI: 237 to 447). Environmental changes affecting suitability of habitat, particularly food availability, are suggested as major factors for limited population recovery during this period. In spring 1997, a mass mortality event reduced the population size to 109 individuals (CV = 0.14; 95% CI: 86 to 145). Mortality was age-specific and resulted in a severe change in the stage composition of the population. Adults were the most affected, and therefore the proportion of juveniles increased from an initial 12% before the event to about 29% after. As a result of both the decrease in seal numbers and the change in population composition, the number of individuals potentially contributing to reproduction fell to about 77 or fewer. This number may not be enough to maintain genetic variability and overcome the effect of demographic stochasticity. The demographic changes caused by the die-off are expected to have both positive and negative effects on the reproductive success of the colony. However, they are undoubtedly factors which potentially threaten the stability and survival of the colony in the near future."
464,2593,Penguin responses to climate change in the Southern Ocean,"Penguins are adapted to live in extreme environments, but they can be highly sensitive to climate change, which disrupts penguin life history strategies when it alters the weather, oceanography and critical habitats. For example, in the southwest Atlantic, the distributional range of the ice-obligate emperor and Adélie penguins has shifted poleward and contracted, while the ice-intolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins have expanded their range southward. In the Southern Ocean, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode are the main modes of climate variability that drive changes in the marine ecosystem, ultimately affecting penguins. The interaction between these modes is complex and changes over time, so that penguin responses to climate change are expected to vary accordingly, complicating our understanding of their future population processes. Penguins have long life spans, which slow microevolution, and which is unlikely to increase their tolerance to rapid warming. Therefore, in order that penguins may continue to exploit their transformed ecological niche and maintain their current distributional ranges, they must possess adequate phenotypic plasticity. However, past species-specific adaptations also constrain potential changes in phenology, and are unlikely to be adaptive for altered climatic conditions. Thus, the paleoecological record suggests that penguins are more likely to respond by dispersal rather than adaptation. Ecosystem changes are potentially most important at the borders of current geographic distributions, where penguins operate at the limits of their tolerance; species with low adaptability, particularly the ice-obligates, may therefore be more affected by their need to disperse in response to climate and may struggle to colonize new habitats. While future sea-ice contraction around Antarctica is likely to continue affecting the ice-obligate penguins, understanding the responses of the ice-intolerant penguins also depends on changes in climate mode periodicities and interactions, which to date remain difficult to reproduce in general circulation models.

465,4152,"Distribution and population structure of the pelagic stingray, Pteroplatytrygon violacea (Dasyatidae), in the south-western Atlantic","The present study analyses the spatial and temporal distribution of the pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) in the south-western Atlantic Ocean, based on data collected between April 1998 and March 2006 by the National Observers Program of the Uruguayan Tuna Fleet. During this period, data were recorded on 51 commercial fishing trips, in which a total of 2 306 851 hooks were set and 2740 stingrays captured. Of these, the sex was determined for 1329 individuals and the size for 944. The average disc width was 47 ± 8 cm (range: 2482 cm) for females and 44 ± 5 cm (range: 2884 cm) for males. The results indicate that the species seems to prefer warm temperate and tropical waters. There were no capture records in waters at &lt;15.3 °C. The data collected suggest a mating season in late spring with a gestation period of 2 to 4 months and births occurring during late summer and early autumn. The increasing bycatch of this ovoviviparous species in pelagic longline fisheries, with an unknown survival rate after discard, coupled to its low reproductive potential, call for better monitoring in order to accurately determine its current conservation status."
466,4284,"Harvest status, reproduction, and mortality in a population of American martens in Quebec, Canada.","Effects of trapping on a previously unexploited (since 1895) population of American martens (Martes americana) were investigated (1984-1994) in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve, Québec. We used trapline-specific data on total harvest and trapping effort, and the age and sex distribution of 8, 801 carcasses to evaluate a commonly applied age- and sex-ratio index for evaluating harvest sustainability. Percent of males in the harvest was linearly related to trapping success. However, juvenile: adult female and juvenile: ovulating female ratios were not significantly related to harvest or trapping success. A sex ratio in favor of males (1.3 to 1.6) male: female was positively associated with trapping success (1.3 to 1.5 captures/100TN) during the last 6 years of the study. Ovulation rate for 1-yr-old females was 44% during 1984-1985, and increased to 76% in 1990, a unique finding for American marten. Mean ovulation rate (4.11 corpora lutea/ovulating female) was exceptionally high for American martens and did not vary significantly among years. The number of ovulations per adult (>2 yrs) female was 3.21; this is among the highest values reported for marten in North America. Annual mortality rate for all ages classes (35%) was similar to the rate calculated for the >5-yr-old cohort. However, mortality rates for martens in the 0-3-yr cohort were 61% (1984-86) and 66% (1990-91). Although sex ratio seemed to be a reliable index of harvest intensity, other commonly used harvest indices (e.g., juveniles: adult females; juveniles: ovulating females) were not significantly related with trapping success. Use of traditional harvest indices for managing marten populations was not supported by our results."
467,107,Changes in Non-breeding distribution and habitat of Pochard Aythya ferina in Britain,"Pochard Aythya ferina wintering in Britain originate in the Baltic countries and the USSR at least as far east as 76°E. Numbers of British wintering pochard doubled between 1948-1951 and 1960-1962; analysis of National Wildfowl Counts since 1960 shows that this dramatic increase continued into the early 1970s. The British population peaked, as it did in the rest of western Europe, during the mid-1970s, with a stabilisation or a slight decline in numbers since that time. The mid-winter population increased from 12-15 000 in the early 1960s to an estimated peak of 50 000. Within Britain, there have been considerable increases in numbers wintering on gravel pits, and sympathetic management of floodlands has also attracted greater numbers of pochard. The most important wintering flock at Duddingston Loch, Edinburgh, which exceeded 8000 in the 1970s, has disappeared due to closure of sewage outfalls in the nearby Firth of Forth. Such changes in habitat use have resulted in the geographical redistribution of pochard within Britain during the last two decades. "
468,2450,Evidence for spillover of reef fishes from a no-take marine reserve: An evaluation using the before-after control-impact (BACI) approach,"No-take marine reserves (NTRs) may promote recovery of exploited populations within their boundaries and spillover of fishes to adjacent fishing grounds, thus potentially benefiting the local fisheries. Although some studies have measured spillover by examining gradients of fish abundance and body size across reserve boundaries, there are no such studies to date including information from before reserve establishment, thus seriously limiting interpretation of results. We measured reef fish spillover from a NTR (Itacolomis Reef, Eastern Brazil) by estimating biomass and body size across the reserve boundary before (2001) and after (2002[long dash]2005) initiation of protection. Replicate sites were sampled inside and outside the reserve, with unprotected sites included in three distance categories from the reserve boundary: 0[long dash]400, 400[long dash]800 and 800[long dash]1200 m. This latter category generally surpasses the scales over which spillover is expected to influence patterns of fish abundance outside reserves (generally <500 m), particularly for relatively sedentary fishes, thus acting as a control for the reserve effect. Habitat measurements were undertaken at the same sites, from 2003 on. Biomass of Scarus trispinosus, a major fishery resource and the dominant species in terms of biomass (37.4% of total biomass), was lower inside the reserve area before its establishment. During this same period, no individuals of two primary target species, Mycteroperca bonaci and Sparisoma axillare, were recorded inside the reserve. Coral cover was consistently lower inside the reserve from 2003 on. Biomass and body size of M. bonaci, as well as biomass of Ocyurus chrysurus, increased continuously inside the reserve after its establishment, with no similar increases recorded in control sites. Evidences of spillover (i.e. higher biomass inside the reserve and in unprotected sites closer to its boundary) were obtained for M. bonaci, O. chrysurus and S. trispinosus, although this pattern was only marginally significant for O. chrysurus. Despite these positive signs, recovery and spillover of S. trispinosus were probably inhibited by increased poaching from 2003 on. Our results indicate that the NTR at Itacolomis Reef was established a priori on poor quality habitats. Thus, future spatial comparisons between protected and unprotected sites would underestimate changes due to protection. These findings highlight the importance of baseline information and continued monitoring for adequately understanding the effects of NTRs, as well as the need of closer collaboration between natural and social scientists in order to effectively protect high-quality habitats in the long term while accounting for the socio-economic needs of local fishing communities."
469,683,Long-Term Changes in Survival Rates of Lesser Snow Geese,"Survival rates of adult and juvenile Anser caerulescens caerulescens were estimated from >80 000 geese banded between 1970-1988 at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba. Adult survival rate increased significantly from ~78% in 1970 to nearly 88% in 1987. Similar increases in adult survival, although not significant, occurred between 1969-1979 at a second colony of snow geese at Cape Henrietta Maria, N Ontario. These increases coincided with a decline in the proportion of snow geese being shot each year on the flyways, suggesting that reduced mortality from hunting may be responsible for the increased survival. Survival rates of fledglings over their first year decreased significantly from a mean of 60% in 1970 to 30% in 1987. This indicates that young geese have been suffering increasing rates of nonhunting mortality, most likely prior to leaving the breeding grounds or on their first autumn migration. Their increased mortality appears to be related to slower growth rates and reduced body size induced by deteriorating feeding conditions on the breeding grounds. -from Authors"
470,4153,"Distribution, seasonal abundance and bycatch of basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) in New Zealand, with observations on their winter habitat","Basking sharks occur throughout New Zealand, but are most common in cool temperate latitudes of 3951°S. Inshore records from miscellaneous sources peaked in springsummer, with few winter records. Two records were of sharks observed in a large brackish water lake. About 203 basking sharks were observed caught by commercial trawlers between 1986 and 1999. Multiple captures were common, including 14 in one tow. Most trawl-caught sharks were taken near or outside the 250 m depth contour, and 91% came from three small regions  East Coast (EC) and West Coast (WC) of South Island and SnaresAuckland Islands (SA). The highest catch (93 sharks) and catch rate (58 sharks per 1,000 tows) were from EC, where sharks were caught only in springsummer. In SA, sharks were caught mainly in summer, and in WC all were caught in winter. The modal seabed depths for shark tows were 300400 m at EC, 700800 m at WC and 150250 m at SA. Sharks were therefore caught in the deepest water in winter at WC. It was impossible to determine the actual depths of capture, but circumstantial evidence indicates that most sharks were caught on or near the bottom. The capture of some sharks in midwater in winter argues against hibernation, because hibernating sharks are unlikely to hover in midwater. Males dominated catches in all regions, particularly in WC and SA. In WC and SA, most sharks (94%) were 78 m long, whereas in EC most sharks (73%) were <7 m. Based on their lengths, many of the WC and SA males could have been mature, but most EC males were probably immature. Few of the females would have been mature. This study provides support for the hypothesis that basking sharks over-winter in deep water on the continental slope."
471,4112,"Communal nesting, activity patterns, and population characteristics in the near-threatened monito del monte, Dromiciops gliroides","The living fossil, Dromiciops gliroides (monito del monte), is an endemic marsupial inhabiting the; temperate rain forests of South America.

Over 4 years we documented a mean population density of 26 (95%; confidence interval 5 1932) individuals/ha. We found significantly greater body mass and BCI for females; than for males, suggesting different energetic strategies during the prehibernation period. Animals were; nocturnal and active until dawn. Communal nesting occurred during summer and early fall, but torpor by single; individuals and small groups was increasingly frequent during winter. Communal nesting could be a key; behavioral strategy affecting survival.

472,2835,Social organization of the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta). 1. Demography,"A 4-year field study of one group of 60-80 spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) in Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve has revealed a form of social system undescribed among carnivores but common among primates. Male juveniles disperse from the natal group around puberty and join a population of nomadic males, wandering widely before settling in a new clan. Adult males frequently leave their adopted clan after a variable period of residence. Females remain in their natal group for life. Thus, the clan comprises several matrilines of related females, while resident adult males originate outside the group. Clans in the Mara tend to be separated by wide buffer zones where prey is scarce and boundary maintenance behaviours are relatively uncommon. Transients are subordinate to residents, but are tolerated by them, in contrast to the more territorial clan system that has been described in Ngorongoro Crater."
473,1972,"Annual variation in clutch size and frequency for loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta, nesting at Little Cumberland Island, Georgia, USA","Clutch size and frequency were assessed for loggerhead turtles, Caretta caretta, nesting at Little Cumberland Island, Georgia, in order to examine annual variation in reproductive characteristics. mean annual clutch size varied significantly (P < 0.01) over a 19 yr period from 1965-1983, although significant differences were found only between mean clutch sizes in the highest (.hivin.x1983 = 127.54) and the lowest (.hivin.x1970 = 114.40) years (P < 0.05). Analysis of observed clutches indicated that mean annual clutch frequency varied significantly (P < 0.01) over a 10 yr period from 1974-1983. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between mean observed clutch frequencies in the highest year (.hivin.x1981 = 3.42) and the two lowest years (.hivin.x1975 = 2.39; .hivin.x1982 = 2.53), as well as between the second highest year (.hivin.x1979 = 3.36) and the lowest year (.hivin.1975 = 2.39). Adjusting observed clutch frequencies for potential unobserved clutches resulted in significant differences (P < 0.05) between the year with the highest estimated mean annual clutch frequency (.hivin.x1979 = 4.18) and the three lowest estimated mean annual clutch frequencies (.hivin.x1982 = 2.81; .hivin.x1975 = 3.06; .hivin.x1977 = 3.07)."
474,2074,The demographic impact of extreme events: stochastic weather drives survival and population dynamics in a long-lived seabird,"1. Most scenarios for future climate change predict increased variability and thus increased frequency of extreme weather events. To predict impacts of climate change on wild populations, we need to understand whether this translates into increased variability in demographic parameters, which would lead to reduced population growth rates even without a change in mean parameter values. This requires robust estimates of temporal process variance, for example in survival, and identification of weather covariates linked to interannual variability.2. The European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis (L.) shows unusually large variability in population size, and large-scale mortality events have been linked to winter gales. We estimated first-year, second-year and adult survival based on 43 years of ringing and dead recovery data from the Isle of May, Scotland, using recent methods to quantify temporal process variance and identify aspects of winter weather linked to survival.3. Survival was highly variable for all age groups, and for second-year and adult birds process variance declined strongly when the most extreme year was excluded. Survival in these age groups was low in winters with strong onshore winds and high rainfall. Variation in first-year survival was not related to winter weather, and process variance, although high, was less affected by extreme years. A stochastic population model showed that increasing process variance in survival would lead to reduced population growth rate and increasing probability of extinction.4. As in other cormorants, shag plumage is only partially waterproof, presumably an adaptation to highly efficient underwater foraging. We speculate that this adaptation may make individuals vulnerable to rough winter weather, leading to boom-and-bust dynamics, where rapid population growth under favourable conditions allows recovery from periodic large-scale weather-related mortality.5. Given that extreme weather events are predicted to become more frequent, species such as shags that are vulnerable to such events are likely to exhibit stronger reductions in population growth than would be expected from changes in mean climate. Vulnerability to extreme events thus needs to be accounted for when predicting the ecological impacts of climate change."
475,953,The dynamics of hunted Icelandic goose populations: a reassessment of the evidence,"1. Migratory geese are dominant terrestrial herbivores in Arctic and north temperate regions. They are important quarry species and also conflict with agricultural interests through winter foraging. We investigated the dynamics of the populations of greylag Anser anser and pink-footed Anser brachyrhynchus geese that breed in Iceland and winter in Britain. 2. We estimated seasonal and annual survival of both populations based on colour-ringing programmes in Iceland 1996-2000 and in Britain since 1987. We used these results, along with hunting bag statistics from Iceland, in a set of models to assess the British autumn counts as well as the impact of hunting. 3. After a rapid increase, the pink-footed goose counts stabilized after 1992 at around 230 000. The greylag goose counts increased slowly to c. 100 000 around 1990 and then declined to around 80 000. Both populations showed stable counts from 1996 to 2000, when the proportion of young recorded in autumn was 17.5% for greylag geese and 18.2% for pink-footed geese. Hunting bag statistics have been compiled since 1995 in Iceland; during 1996-2000, means of 36 608 greylag geese and 13 991 pink-footed geese were reported shot annually. 4. Mean annual adult and first-year survival estimates were 0.727 and 0.472 for greylag geese, and 0.814 and 0.394 for pink-footed geese. The lower survival of juvenile pink-footed geese was probably due to higher natural mortality, whereas the generally lower survival of greylag geese could be explained by higher hunting pressure. 5. Simple modelling showed that the results from autumn surveys and bag statistics were incompatible for greylag geese. For the population to remain stable with the estimated survival rate, the proportion of juveniles in autumn must be 30%. We suggest that problems in separating juveniles from adults in October-November caused the lower proportion of juveniles recorded. Also, the number of greylag geese counted in autumn and the number reported shot in Iceland cannot both be correct; the bag statistics imply a population twice as large as the number counted. Large numbers of greylag geese may winter in areas not covered by the autumn census, but overreporting of the hunting bag may also have occurred. No such discrepancies were found for pink-footed geese. 6. Synthesis and applications. We recommend that a stratified sampling programme be established for estimating the size and age composition of both goose species. The age composition of greylag geese can profitably be studied in Iceland in August, when juveniles are easily recognizable. Ringing should be continued as a tool for monitoring survival, and a hunting bag survey should be implemented in Britain. In general, the reliability of population surveys should always be tested with independent data."
476,1726,The impact of Tropical Cyclone Larry on bird communities in fragments of the endangered rainforest Type 5b,"Bird surveys were conducted to assess the impact of a severe cyclone on bird communities in three fragments of the endangered rainforest Type 5b on the Atherton Tablelands of far north Queensland. Bird communities were surveyed using timed area searches in three sites in each of the three fragments and were undertaken prior to and following Tropical Cyclone Larry. Cyclone Larry caused short-term changes in the abundance of some species of birds in Type 5b rainforest fragments. Two weeks after the storm, in two of three fragments surveyed, abundance of the frugivorous wompoo fruit-dove (Ptilinopus magnificus) and figbird (Sphecotheres viridis) had decreased while the omnivorous Macleay's honeyeater (Xanthotis macleayana) and Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii) decreased in abundance in all three locations. Most insectivorous species increased in some sites and decreased in others following Cyclone Larry. Rapid recovery of bird communities to approximately their pre-cyclone state after only 7 months appeared to reflect the capacity of species to either modify their foraging behaviour, switch foods, or to move within or between fragments or to other food sources in the landscape.

477,4609,An initial assessment of drought sensitivity in Amazonian fish communities,"The Amazon River Basin encompasses the world's largest remaining tropical rainforest, and the largest freshwater system with the highest fish species diversity on earth, but global climate change is predicted to cause the loss of 7-12% of fish species by 2070. The severe drought anomaly of 2005, caused by warming of Atlantic surface waters, provided a unique opportunity to examine the impact of a major climatic disturbance on a tropical fish assemblage. We monitored fish species diversity in six Brazilian floodplain lakes along the Solimões River from 2004 to 2007 (before, during, and after drought). Statistical analysis revealed changes in species composition of these lakes following the drought, with both positive and negative responses observed. The response to drought was not uniform among species with regard to trophic guild or migratory behavior. SIMPER analysis showed that planktivores on the average increased in abundance in the years following the drought, carnivores and omnivores decreased, and herbivores and detritivores increased. Some of these changes were transitory, others persisted through monitoring. Migratory species disproportionately increased in abundance post-drought compared to non-migratory species. Interlake (β) diversity of fish declined during the drought year, indicating that lakes were becoming less heterogeneous in species composition, but showed a trend toward recovery of pre-drought level in the following years. According to both global climate change models and recent experience, the intensity and frequency of droughts in this region of the world is increasing. Given the sensitivity of resident fish species to the single, short-term, perturbation reported here, assessment of how tropical freshwater fish populations respond to drought will be crucial to understanding the consequences of this kind of perturbation to these communities and to the human inhabitants who depend upon this important protein source.

All the males brooded during 13 months and presented smaller home range than the females during the breeding season. The highest densities were found on shallowest areas."
479,2991,Effects of Spearfishing on Reef Fish Populations in a Multi-Use Conservation Area,"Although spearfishing is a popular method of capturing fish, its ecological effects on fish populations are poorly understood, which makes it difficult to assess the legitimacy and desirability of spearfishing in multi-use marine reserves. Recent management changes within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) fortuitously created a unique scenario by which to quantify the effects of spearfishing on fish populations. As such, we employed underwater visual surveys and a before-after-control-impact experimental design to investigate the effects of spearfishing on the density and size structure of target and non-target fishes in a multi-use conservation park zone (CPZ) within the GBRMP. Three years after spearfishing was first allowed in the CPZ, there was a 54% reduction in density and a 27% reduction in mean size of coral trout (Plectropomus spp.), the primary target species. These changes were attributed to spearfishing because benthic habitat characteristics and the density of non-target fishes were stable through time, and the density and mean size of coral trout in a nearby control zone (where spearfishing was prohibited) remained unchanged. We conclude that spearfishing, like other forms of fishing, can have rapid and substantial negative effects on target fish populations. Careful management of spearfishing is therefore needed to ensure that conservation obligations are achieved and that fishery resources are harvested sustainably. This is particularly important both for the GBRMP, due to its extraordinarily high conservation value and world heritage status, and for tropical island nations where people depend on spearfishing for food and income. To minimize the effects of spearfishing on target species and to enhance protection of functionally important fishes (herbivores), we recommend that fishery managers adjust output controls such as size- and catch-limits, rather than prohibit spearfishing altogether. This will preserve the cultural and social importance of spearfishing in coastal communities where it is practised. "
480,1522,"Monitoring the Trend of Harbor Seals in Prince William Sound, Alaska, After the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill.","We used aerial counts to monitor the trend in numbers of harbor seals, Phoca vitulina richardsi, in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Repetitive counts were made at 25 haul-out sites during the annual molt period each year from 1990 through 1997. A generalized linear model indicated that time of day, date, and time relative to low tide significantly affected seal counts. When Poisson regression was used to adjust counts to a standardized set of survey conditions, results showed a highly significant decline of 4.6% per year. Unadjusted counts indicated a slight, but not statistically significant, decline in the number of seals. The number of harbor seals on the trend-count route in eastern and central PWS has been declining since at least 1984, with an overall population reduction of 63% through 1997. Programs to monitor long-term changes in animal population sizes should account for factors that can cause short-term variations in indices of abundance. The inclusion of such factors as covariates in models can improve the accuracy of monitoring programs."
481,3691,Habitat suitability and source-sink dynamics of beavers,"1.Theory suggests that territorial species should share many of the same dynamical; characteristics as metapopulations, including asynchronous local dynamics, potential; for stochastic extinction of the population when rates of successful dispersal fall below; mortality risk, and critical importance of the ratio of suitable to unsuitable habitat for; long-term persistence. These propositions were tested on a population of beavers (Castor; canadensis; Kuhl) in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, which has been continuously; monitored over 11 years.; 2.; Results showed that the total population was considerably less variable than local; abundance at 14 beaver colonies, due to asynchrony among local populations. This suggests; that local ecological interactions were more important in determining year-to-year; variation in beaver numbers than broad-scale environmental processes, such as weather.; 3.; Of the local colonies, 20% were never abandoned over 11 years, although there was; considerable turnover among adults. Offspring production exceeded adult abundance at; five source colonies, which did not quite compensate for negative net production at nine; sink colonies. These observations were consistent with predictions of spatially structured; models of territoriality incorporating local variation in habitat suitability. Mean colony size; and probability of recurrence from year-to-year were associated with local food availability,; indicating that trophic interactions were important in determining local population; dynamics.; 4.; The beaver population in Algonquin declined steadily over the study period, however,; suggesting that spatial and demographic processes were insufficient to stabilize; abundance over time. This is consistent with predictions of spatially structured models; of territoriality in which suitable and unsuitable habitats are interspersed.

482,690,"Harvest dynamics of mustelid carnivores in Ontario, Canada","Virtual population analysis (cohort analysis) was used to reconstruct past dynamics of a harvested population of martens Martes americana in the Bracebridge District of southern Ontario. Harvests in the Bracebridge District were managed using a quota system set by regional authorities. Quotas changed from year to year, apparently on the basis of past trapping success and variation in the proportion of young-of-the-year among harvested animals. The proportion of young in the harvest was a sensitive indicator of the annual rate of increase, whereas trapping success tended to be linked most strongly, in inverse fashion, with marten harvesting quotas. The proportion of martens harvested each year was constant, averaging 34%, despite 3-fold variation in marten abundance. This proportion was very close to the maximum sustainable yield (36%) for the population, suggesting that the management policy in the administrative unit was effective in the past in sustaining the source population as well as yielding high trapping returns. Monte Carlo simulation showed that proportionate harvesting, such as the policy in the Bracebridge District during 1972-1991, should be considerably less likely to lead to overharvesting than a constant quota policy, particularly at high average yields."
483,857,Long-term dynamics of small mammal populations in Ontario,"We analyzed 43 yr of live-trapping data for eight species of small mammals in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario. Our primary objective was to test whether complex nonlinear models are necessary to describe dynamics of the Algonquin rodent populations. Variation in abundance among species was related to mean abundance by a simple power function with an exponent of 1.77, implying that population variability did not increase with mean density as much as one might expect for strictly statistical reasons. Time-series analyses of annual population densities indicated no significant autocorrelation functions for five species. Southern red-backed voles, red squirrels, and flying squirrels had significant autocorrelations, but only flying squirrels had an autocorrelation function suggestive of cyclic population dynamics. Per capita rates of population growth were density-dependent in all eight species, although in most cases there was substantial deviation around the fitted regression lines. Response surface models with one- and two-year lags significantly improved the statistical fit to data for three species, but only one of these response surface models was sustainable in the face of realistic stochastic variation in per capita growth. These results suggest that simple logistic models are adequate for predicting the long-term dynamics of the Algonquin small-mammal assemblage. All eight species showed evidence of synchronized population fluctuations over time, suggesting trophic linkages due to shared food resources, shared predators, or both."
484,689,"Density dependence, prey dependence and population dynamics of Martens in Ontario","Ecological factors influencing demographic parameters of mammalian carnivores are poorly understood, due to the difficulty of simultaneously measuring predator and prey populations over an extended period. We used cohort analysis based on age-specific harvest data to estimate population densities over 20 yr for martens (Martes americana). Marten abundance increased threefold over the study period, probably due to relaxation in harvest intensity at the beginning of the study interval. Changes in rates of population growth by martens were positively correlated with population densities of three species of small mammals recorded over the same time span: deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), red squirrels (Tamiasciuris hudsonicus), and flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus). We found no evidence of short-term cycles in marten abundance, nor were there significant cross-correlations at lags greater than 1 with prey population densities. Martens also showed evidence of density-dependent population growth. Such density dependence beyond the demographic effect of variation in prey density was possibly due to agonistic interactions among territory holders. Such mixtures of prey dependence and density dependence often have a stabilizing influence in theoretical models, which could contribute to the observed stability of deer mouse, red squirrel, and marten populations in Algonquin Park. Harvest intensity was negatively related to yearly variation in marten population growth. Mortality due to trapping averaged 37.9% over two decades, with no detectable relationship to changes in marten population density. Hence, harvesting acted as a stochastic external variable that was additive to density-dependent and prey-dependent effects."
485,1046,"Local variation in arctic fox abundance on Svalbard, Norway","Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) numbers vary greatly, with cyclic fluctuations often associated with fluctuations in microtine rodents. However, in areas where small prey mammals are absent, such as Iceland and Svalbard, such cyclic fluctuations are lacking. Annual fluctuations in the density of the arctic fox population on the Brøggerhalvøya peninsula and Kongsfjorden region on Svalbard, Norway, were studied from 1990 to 2001 by using indices of fox abundance. All indices showed similar trends; fox numbers were low in 1990, increased until 1995 whereupon they decreased sharply, before increasing again and levelling off in 2001. Increasing numbers of foxes during the first part of the study paralleled increasing numbers of Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) carcasses in winter and increasing numbers of nesting barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) in summer. This study shows that the number of arctic foxes varies greatly even in areas without fluctuating microtine rodents."
486,3459,Estimating trends in alligator populations from nightlight survey data,"Nightlight surveys are commonly used to evaluate status and trends of crocodilian populations, but imperfect detection caused by survey- and location-specific factors makes it difficult to draw population inferences accurately from uncorrected data. We used a two-stage hierarchical model comprising population abundance and detection probability to examine recent abundance trends of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) in subareas of Everglades wetlands in Florida using nightlight survey data. During 2001-2008, there were declining trends in abundance of small and/or medium sized animals in a majority of subareas, whereas abundance of large sized animals had either demonstrated an increased or unclear trend. For small and large sized class animals, estimated detection probability declined as water depth increased. Detection probability of small animals was much lower than for larger size classes. The declining trend of smaller alligators may reflect a natural population response to the fluctuating environment of Everglades wetlands under modified hydrology. It may have negative implications for the future of alligator populations in this region, particularly if habitat conditions do not favor recruitment of offspring in the near term. Our study provides a foundation to improve inferences made from nightlight surveys of other crocodilian populations. "
487,3796,Long-term monitoring reveals declines in an endemic predator following invasion by an exotic prey species,"Invasive predators can cause population declines in native prey species, but empirical evidence linking declines of native predators to invasive prey is relatively rare. Here, we document declines in an Australian freshwater crocodile Crocodylus johnstoni population following invasion of a toxic prey species, the cane toad Rhinella marina. Thirty-five years of standardized spotlight surveys of four segments of a large river in northern Australia revealed that the density of freshwater crocodiles decreased following toad invasion and continued to decline thereafter. Overall, intermediate-sized freshwater crocodiles (0.61.2?m) were most severely impacted. Densities of saltwater crocodiles Crocodylus porosus increased over time and were generally less affected by toad arrival, although toad impacts were inconsistent across survey sections and size classes. Across the entire river, total freshwater crocodile densities declined by 69.5% between 1997 and 2013. Assessments of the status of this species within other large river systems in northern Australia, where baseline data are available from before the toads arrived, should be prioritized. Our findings highlight the importance of long-term monitoring programmes for quantifying the impacts of novel and unforeseen threats."
488,3689,"Recovery of saltwater crocodiles following unregulated hunting in tidal rivers of the Northern Territory, Australia","Saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in the Northern Territory of Australia were protected in 1971, after a severe population decline resulting from 26 yr of intense commercial hunting. By that time wild saltwater crocodiles were rarely sighted anywhere and they were commercially extinct in areas where they had once been abundant. Standardized monitoring by spotlight surveys started in 1975 and provided relative density indices over time (1975-2009) as a unique record of the post-protection recovery of a wild crocodilian population. We examined the survey data for populations at 12 major tidal rivers, individually and as a single subpopulation. The pattern of recovery in the subpopulation in both abundance and biomass was approximated by logistic curves, predicting 5.26 non-hatchling crocodiles weighing 387.64 kg sighted per kilometer of river in 2010. We predicted potential carrying capacity as 5.58 non-hatchling crocodiles (5.73% higher than 2010) weighing 519.0 kg (25.31% higher than 2010). Individual rivers showed largely different abundance and biomass among rivers. The statistical model that best described the recovery in individual rivers was not always logistic. However, where it was logistic, expected carrying capacity of different rivers showed considerable variation in abundance and biomass. The variation indicates different habitat quality among the rivers. Recovery occurred despite various consumptive uses, particularly a widespread egg-harvest program, which has been an integral part of the incentive-driven conservation program for saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory since 1983. We suggest that the saltwater crocodile population of the Northern Territory is achieving full recovery from uncontrolled hunting in 1945-1971. Although saltwater crocodiles are considered an important natural resource, their increase in number, size, and distribution is posing management issues for public safety. Continuation of human-crocodile conflict management through public education and strategic removal of problem crocodiles will be essential. "
489,2737,Population dynamics of wild bonobos (Pan paniscus) at Wamba,"We analyzed population dynamics and birth seasonality of wild bonobos at Wamba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, based on 20 years of observations (1976-1996). Wamba Bonobo infant mortality is much lower than that reported for chimpanzees. This seemes to be related to several socioecological characteristics of bonobos: the use of abundant fruit and herbaceous foods, larger food patch size, female feeding priority, and the absence of infanticide. The mean interval between live births of 4.8 years is shorter than those reported for chimpanzees, and some females simultaneously carried and nursed two successive offspring. Mother-offspring conflicts, such as refusal of suckling attempts and interference with mothers' copulation, which are common in chimpanzees, are rare in Wamba bonobos. A birth peak seems to occur during the light rainy season from March to May, just after the season with the least rainfall. This timing of births is similar to those reported for chimpanzee populations, and might benefit both mother and offspring by maximizing the amount of time before the next dry season."
490,932,"Influence of water level drawdown on the fish populations of Cross Lake, Manitoba","Regulated discharges into Cross Lake, Manitoba, resulted in average summer water volumes in 1980 and 1981 that were 49% lower than preregulated volumes. Standing crops of lake whitefish Coregonous clupeaformis, walleye Stizostedion vitreum vitreum, northern pike Esox lucius and cisco Coregonus artedii are lower now than in preregulation and early postregulation years. Unusually early and rapid drawdown in March 1981 resulted in a severe winterkill, causing a substantial decrease in catches per unit of effort for most species from 1980 to 1981. The amount of fall to late spring drawdown and the year-class strengths of coregonid fishes were inversely related. A marked overwinter drawdown reduces whitefish and cisco hatching success apparently by dewatering their spawning areas and desiccating the eggs. Low water levels in spring prevented pike and walleye access to spawning areas. -from Authors"
491,3676,"Demography of the Side-Blotched Lizard, Uta stansburiana, in Sand Dunes of the Central Chihuahuan Desert","We studied demography of a population of side-blotched lizards, Uta stansburiana, in the sand dunes of Reserva de Biosfera de Mapimí, Durango, Mexico, during 1989-1994. Reproduction in females occurred during January-July, which coincided with late dry and early wet seasons. Reproductive activity was highest in the middle of the dry season (February-March). At an average age of 10 months, 32 of females had reached sexual maturity. A notable feature of summer and autumn was the greater number of hatchlings and juveniles, coinciding with the wet season. Overall sex ratio did not differ from 1:1. Density of adults was 1-59/ha. This population had early maturity, a relatively short life expectancy, and many offspring."
492,2856,"Effect of a network of no-take reserves in increasing catch per unit effort and stocks of exploited reef fish at Nabq, South Sinai, Egypt","In 1995, in collaboration with local Bedouin fishermen, five no-take fisheries reserves were established within the Nabq Natural Resource Protected Area, South Sinai, Egyptian Red Sea. The abundance, size structure and catch of commercially targeted groupers (Serranidae), emperors (Lethrinidae) and snappers (Lutjanidae) were investigated before the establishment of these reserves, then in 1997 and again in 2000. By 1997, these fish had shown a significant increase in mean abundance within two of the no-take reserves. By 2000 each family and three individual species (Lethrinus obsoletus, Cephalopholis argus and Variola louti) had increased in abundance in the reserves. There were significant increases in mean individual length of the serranids Epinephelus fasciatus and C. argus and of the lethrinids L. nebulosus and Monotaxis grandoculis. Meanwhile, mean recorded catch per unit effort (CPUE) within the adjacent fished areas increased by about two-thirds (P <0.05) during the 5 years. The establishment of the no-take reserves appears to have played a key role in maintaining the sustainability of the fishery. The involvement of local Bedouin and fishermen in the co-management of fisheries resources was critical to the success of this initiative."
493,4385,Population dynamics of a colony of Little egrets Egretta garzetta at an estuary in Northern Spain,"The population of little egrets Egretta garzetta in Spain is over 20,000 adult breeding birds, making it one of the largest in Europe. Apart from its population size and population trends, the parameters associated with the dynamics (e.g., survival) of the species in Spain are virtually unknown. Our aims were to develop models to assess (1) the colony growth rate, and (2) apparent survival rate of a colony of little egrets breeding in northern Iberia. We used capture-recapture data of little egrets ringed as chicks within the colony, of normally < 30 adult breeding pairs, over a 14-year period starting in 1999. Colony size was observed to be increasing in a linear tendency broken by specific catastrophic events: a very strong hailstorm in 2004 and a pair of peregrines Falco peregrinus that killed several adults in 2005. By 2012, the colony had still not reached the size that it was before the decrease, so it can be concluded that sporadic catastrophic events can have a significant effect on colony size and subsequently population size, especially in small colonies. Annual apparent survival (±SE) was constant and differed between age classes (first-years: 0.15 ± 0.05; adults: 0.78 ± 0.06). Our survival estimate was relatively high compared with other little egret populations, especially for adults. This result, however, may not necessarily apply to other colonies given our small sample size and the lack of data on other factors that also affect the dynamics of the study population."
494,2374,Density estimates of nine hornbill species in a lowland forest site in southern Thailand,"Hornbills are useful indicators of forest condition and human disturbance because they require large tracts of unfragmented forest with large fruiting trees for feeding and nesting. They are relatively large-bodied, which makes them targets for hunting. Density estimates of such species are critical for population monitoring and serve as a baseline against which future changes can be measured. in this study we used variable-width line transect surveys to estimate the densities of nine hornbill species in the Bala portion of the Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary on the Thai-Malaysia border, one of the few remaining areas of lowland forest in Thailand. The hornbill species were: Rhinoceros (Buceros rhinoceros), Great (B. bicornis), Helmeted (B. vigil), Black (Anthracoccros malayanus), Bushy-crested (Anorrhinus galeritus), White-crowned (Aceros comatus), Wrinkled (A. corrugatus), Wreathed (A. undulatus) and Plain-pouched (A. subruficollis). Between January 2001 and April 2002, 11 transects along trails, old logging roads and one paved road were surveyed once per month. A total of 1,261 observations of the nine species were made during the observation period. Estimates for Rhinoceros and Helmeted Hornbill were 2.69 and 1.21 individuals/km2, respectively, and were similar or slightly higher than densities reported elsewhere. Estimates for Great (0.12), Bushy-crested (0.64), Wrinkled (0.08), White-crowned (0.08) and Wreathed Hornbills (0.69) were generally lower than estimates from other areas in the region. It was not possible to obtain density estimates using distance sampling for Black and Plain-pouched Hornbills due to the small number of observations, but our data did suggest that their densities were also low (0.10 individuals/km2). Potential reasons for differences between this and other areas include a scarcity of lowland habitat, habitat isolation, lower abundance of specific fruit resources and interspecific competition, but these factors require further investigation. Standardization of survey techniques among studies would significantly improve assessments of habitat requirements as well as of the effects of human disturbance on Asian hornbills, most of which are globally threatened. Our study specifically underscores the need for additional research on the Plain-pouched Hornbill, the most threatened of the species studied, as density estimates from elsewhere in its range are lacking, while more generally it highlights the need to investigate the underlying causes of the often substantial variation in hornbill densities among species and sites."
495,1717,Population Dynamics of a Resident Colony of Leptonycteris curasoae (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) in Central M&eacute;xico,"We studied the population dynamics of the lesser long-nosed bat Leptonycteris curasoae in a cave in central Mexico for a two-year time. The population had substantial seasonal changes in size and composition during this time. Colony size was largest from February to July (22,000-27,000 adults) and contained equal numbers of males and females. In June and July, males had enlarged testes and presumably mated with females. In August, the population size began to decline and was mostly composed of pregnant females. Between September and December, the colony was composed exclusively of pregnant and lactating females and their young, and population size decreased to about one-third of the observed maximum size. In January, adult males returned to the roost and the population size increased. We also observed an increase in body mass and fat accumulation in,both sexes, apparently related to reproductive activity. This is the first report of the continuous presence of a substantial female population of L. curasoae throughout the year in a single roost in Mexican tropics, indicating that some populations of L. curasoae in central Mexico complete their life cycle without having to migrate."
496,2359,A 20-Yr Study Documenting the Relationship Between Turtle Decline and Human Recreation,"This study documents the detrimental effects of human recreation on the North American wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta) in Connecticut. We chronicled the dynamics of two allopatric wood turtle populations in a protected southern New England wildlife reserve for 20 yr (1974-1993). Both wood turtle populations were reproductively isolated from one another, physically separated $\approx$100 yr ago when a 1.5 km long human-made pond was constructed. We conducted a mark-and-recapture study on a 1000-ha section of a protected watershed in south-central Connecticut (New Haven County). During this study we monitored 133 different wood turtles, observing them a total of 1176 times. Human and wood turtle demographics were recorded throughout this period. The data support the following conclusions: (1) following a period of apparent stability, two populations of wood turtles declined; (2) the declines were more or less synchronous in both populations; (3) the beginning of each decline corresponded to the opening of the habitat for recreation; (4) an increase in mean turtle age suggests a failure of recruitment; however, (5) a simultaneous reduction in numbers of adult females suggests that the failure of recruitment alone is not sufficient to explain the declines. Throughout our study the size of the forest remained the same, road building was restricted, and the quality of the air and water were constant. The wood turtle populations remained stable when people were denied access to the property. When this area was opened to human recreation (hiking, fishing) the two discrete wood turtle populations declined steadily; the total number of turtles in both populations declined by 100% in 10 yr. As wilderness areas become mixed-use recreation areas, wood turtle populations may suffer. We conclude that without proper management, the increasing recreational use of parks, reservoirs, and wildlife reserves will adversely affect the long-term survival of the North American wood turtle."
497,4179,Raptor population trends in northern Botswana: A re-survey of road transects after 20 years,"Across Africa, many raptor species, especially vultures, are in steep decline. Botswana is regionally important for numerous raptor species including vultures, but recent population trends of raptors within this country are totally unknown. In 2015–2016 we repeated road transects for raptors across northern Botswana that were first conducted in 1991–1995. In total, we re-surveyed 20,712 km of transects. From these data we explored changes in abundance of 29 species. Fourteen species (48%) showed significant declines. Of these, 11 species declined by >50% and three species declined by 37–50%. Non-significant declines of >70% were shown for four species, of 30–65% for six species and of <10% for a further two species. In contrast only three species, all large eagles – tawny eagle (Aquila rapax), brown snake eagle (Circaetus cinereus) and black-chested snake eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), showed significant but small increases of between 6 and 15%. For most species, population trends were similar both inside and outside of protected areas, with only two species showing significantly different trends. Declines of bateleur eagle (Terathopius ecaudatus) were lower inside protected areas. In contrast, brown snake eagles showed stable populations inside protected areas but large increases outside of protected areas. These re-surveys suggest extremely worrying trends for multiple raptor species in Botswana, and highlights the benefit of repeating historical surveys to understand population trends in countries that lack systematic monitoring of wildlife populations."
498,4477,"Distributional pattern of rays (Pisces, Rajidae) in the Strait of Sicily in relation to fishing pressure","Rays are amongst the most vulnerable of exploited marine fish due to their life-history strategy (low fecundity, high age at maturity, slow growth). In this paper, we examine the distributional pattern of the thornback ray (Raja clavata Linnaeus, 1758), brown ray (Raja miraletus Linnaeus, 1758) and other species of Rajidae in the Strait of Sicily, in the context of changed fishing pressure. In the last decade, most of the Mazara del Vallo trawl fleet (one of the largest and most active in the Mediterranean) has moved southeastwards onto the African continental shelf looking for new fishing grounds. Data are provided from four scientific trawl surveys conducted over a wide area of the Strait of Sicily (covering part of the African shelf) in autumn 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001. In addition, we analysed research survey data collected along the Sicilian continental shelf between 1985 and 2002. Analysis of distributional patterns and mean catch rates, over the 4-year survey series, revealed low abundances of all ray species on the Sicilian shelf. Data also suggested a remarkable decline in ray abundance on the African shelf. However, data from 1985 to 2002 reported an increasing abundance trend of Raja clavata and Raja miraletus on the Adventure Bank, located on the southwest side of the Sicilian shelf. Analyses of trawling effort for this latter area indicated that fishing effort has decreased gradually in the last 10 years."
499,2452,"Estimation of the Iberian lynx (&lt;i&gt;Lynx pardinus&lt;/i&gt;) population in the Doñana area, SW Spain, using capture–recapture analysis of camera-trapping data","The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) has a highly restricted geographic distribution, limited even within the Iberian Peninsula. The last national survey reported less than 200 remaining individuals, distributed in two isolated areas-Andújar-Cardeña and Doñana-and in consequence, the Iberian lynx was listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as ""Critically Endangered"". In this study, we estimate the Iberian lynx population size in the Doñana area using capture-recapture analysis of camera-trapping data. A model with different capture probability for each individual (Mh) yielded an estimate of 26 Iberian lynxes (SE = 5. 26) more than 1 year old. It is considered that a small slant in the estimation of the number of individuals could exist due to the presence of dispersers inside the study area that were not detected. Our study shows: (1) a reduction in number since the 1980s (45 individuals), and falling below the theoretical threshold of genetic viability, (2) changes in the species' spatial distribution in this area, and (3) as for other carnivore species, photographic capture-recapture methods are applicable for estimating the size of Iberian lynx populations "
500,2777,Population trend over 100 years and conservation needs of breeding sandwich terns (Sterna sandvicensis) on the German North Sea coast,"The breeding population of the sandwich tern (Sterna sandvicensis) on the German North Sea coast has undergone substantial fluctuations throughout the last 100 years. Numbers of breeding birds were fluctuating quite strongly in the first 30 years of the twentieth century. From 1930 to the mid-1950s, a relatively steady decrease occurred. A minimum was reached in 1965 with 2,243 pairs. Around 1970, numbers increased quite markedly up to the mid-1990s and reached a centurial maximum with 10,138 pairs in 1996. Most recently, the numbers have dropped to only 5,681 pairs in 2005, the lowest number over the last 30 years. Some colonies have existed over long periods, others only for short periods, with often substantial and sudden changes. The distribution at sea was studied by transect counts from ships. During the reproductive period, high totals were found between the mainland coast and the islands, up to 30 km from the outer coast/island line. The seaward extent of the sandwich tern distribution coincided quite well with the 20-m depth line. Maximum foraging ranges for single colonies were estimated to be ca. 45 km for Trischen, ca. 35 km for Norderoog and ca. 30 km for both Scharhorn/Nigehorn and Juist. Overall flight ranges for all colonies were estimated at 33.8 km for 95% of the birds. Germany has a high international responsibility for the protection of this species. Only a few colonies exist every year, making this species very vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance, pollution events and fishing activities."
501,3371,"The Harbor porpoise, Phocoena phocoena, in Fish Harbour, New Brunswick, Canada: occupancy, distribution and movements","Numbers were highest between late July and early September, the period during which surface temperatures attain a maximum (10-12oC) and the largest herring Clupea harengus catches are usually made. During July-September the porpoise population of the inner (W) part of the study area contained 63% mothers with calves. Changes in relative population abundance were most strongly related with time of year (increasing from early July), tidal amplitude (most present when amplitude is 6.5m or less), and wind phase (most present during onshore winds). Consistent specific 'territories' and patrolling patterns were identified. A marked decrease in relative abundance in the latter half of the 1970s was noted, coincident with a decline in mean midsummer surface temperature over 1974-78 of 1oC.-from Authors"
502,4244,"Temporal and spatial trends in size, biomass and abundance of groupers (Epinephelinae) in Mafia Island Marine Park: fishers’ perceptions and underwater visual census surveys","Fishers perceptions of changes in grouper size and abundance were compared with scientific data collected; via underwater visual censuses (UVCs) before (1995) and after (2006 and 2011) the establishment of the Mafia Island Marine Park. Perceptions on changes in the size structure of groupers differed among communities due to differences in fishing capacities. Fishers in one village had mixed perceptions, while in another village the majority (66%) perceived a decline in size, with small groupers dominating the catch. Similarly, UVCs indicated that size structure was dominated by small groupers at all times surveyed. Consistent with fishers perceptions, UVC indicated that biomass and abundance of groupers declined in both no-take zones (NTZs) and specified-use zones (SUZs) between 1995 and 2006, with no substantial changes between 2006 and 2011. The NTZs had higher density and diversity of grouper species than SUZs, as would be expected from the differences in bottom topography in these two types of areas. The idea that NTZs could increase the biomass and abundance of groupers to benefit fished zones was not found, thus indicating that NTZs are not necessarily the best option for managing reef fisheries."
503,3398,Population and trends of Canadian Arctic seabirds,"Canada's eastern Arctic (Nunavut and Arctic Quebec-Nunavik, N of 60°) supports large numbers of seabirds in summer. Seabird breeding habitat in this region includes steep, rocky coasts and low-lying coasts backed by lowland sedge-meadow tundra. The former areas support colonial cliff- and scree-nesting seabirds, such as murres and fulmars; the latter inland or coastal seabirds, such as terns, gulls and jaegers. The region supports some 4 million breeding seabirds, of which the most numerous are thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia; 75%), black guillemots (Cepphus grylle; 9%), northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis; 8%) and black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla; 6%). The majority of Arctic seabirds breed in a small number of very large colonies (≥ 10,000 birds), but there are also substantial numbers of non-colonial or small-colony breeding populations that are scattered more widely (e. g. terns, guillemots). Population trends among Canadian Arctic seabirds over the past few decades have been variable, with no strongly negative trends except for the rare ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea): this contrasts with nearby Greenland, where several species have shown steep declines. Although current seabird trends raise only small cause for concern, climate amelioration may enable increased development activities in the north, potentially posing threats to some seabirds on their breeding grounds.

504,2795,"Trends in common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) and anchovy (Engraulis ringens) biomass, central-southern Chile, 1991-2005","Common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) and anchovy (Engraulis ringens) constitute the main commercial small pelagic fishing activity in central-southern Chile, with average annual catches between 1991 and 2005 of 342,000 tons (common sardine) and 405,000 tons (anchovy). Abundance estimates for these species were obtained through statistical models of catch by age. These models incorporate information on annual catches, catch by unit of effort, biomass estimated by acoustic methods, size structure, and biological information (growth parameters, maturity, weight). Parameter estimates were done using maximum verosimilitude methods. The analysis of the structure by age of sardine and anchovy catches shows a high presence of recruits and adult fraction that has decreased over time. The abundance levels were especially low for common sardine; the 2005 spawning biomass was 207,600 tons, as compared to the 485,000 tons estimated in 1991. Common sardine recruitment (age group 0) was currently found to be 280,600 tons, lower than the 392,000 tons estimated at the beginning of the study period. For anchovy, the 2005 spawning biomass was 460,000 tons, as compared to the 415,000 tons of 1991, and 2005 recruitment was estimated at 275,000 tons, lower than the 291,000 tons of 1991."

Following the species introduction, the CPUE of gibel carp increased significantly with the decrease in CPUE of largebodied native fish species. "
506,918,Gray Whales and the value of monitoring data in implementing the U.S. Endangered Species Act,"Many scientists lament the absence of data for endangered species and argue that more funds should be spent acquiring basic information about population trends. Using 19 years of abundance estimates for the eastern North Pacific gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), we sampled subsets of the Original survey data to identify the number of years of data required to remove the population from the U.S. Endangered Species Act's (ESA) list of endangered and threatened wildlife. For any given duration of monitoring, we selected all possible combinations of consecutive counts. To incorporate variability in growth rates, we extracted a maximum likelihood estimator of growth rate and confidence interval about that growth rate on the assumption that the population changes can be approximated by a simple diffusion process with drift. We then applied a new approach to determine ESA status for each subset of survey data and found that a quantitative decision to delist is unambiguously supported by 11 years of data but is precariously uncertain with fewer than 10 years of data. The data needed to produce an unequivocal decision to delist gray whales cost the National Marine Fisheries Service an estimated U.S. $660,000, a surprisingly modest expense given the fact that delisting can greatly simplify regulatory constraints. This example highlights the value of population monitoring in administering the ESA and provides a compelling example of the utility of such information in identifying both imperiled and recovered species. The economic value of such data is that they provide the foundation for delisting, which could ultimately save much more money than the collection of the data would ever cost."
507,3695,Distribution and status of the Seychelles frogs (Amphibia: Anura: Soooglossidae),"The distribution and population densities of the Sooglossidae are evaluated. This family of frogs is endemic to the Seychelles islands where four species are restricted to high forests on the islands of Mahé and Silhouette. New distribution data are presented and habitat preferences quantified. Previously Sooglossus thomasseti was considered to be restricted to moss forest; here it is shown that the species is found in boulder fields, with the highest population densities in the moss forest zone, but occurs down to 80 m above sea level. Sooglossus sechellensis is also largely associated with higher altitudes, but suitable microclimates may occur at 300 m a.s.l. Sooglossus pipilodryas is restricted to palm-rich habitat on Silhouette island. Sooglossus gardineri is the most widespread and tolerant species and the only one to occur in degraded habitats. Monitoring methods are evaluated, with direct estimation from quadrats being the preferred method. All four species are considered Vulnerable due to their restricted ranges; S. thomasseti and S. sechellensis may also be threatened by habitat loss."
508,3857,Conservation of the Seychelles sheath-tailed bat Coleura seychellensis from 1997-2011 and future prospects,"The Critically Endangered Seychelles sheath-tailed bat Coleura seychellensis has been the; subject of conservation activity on Silhouette Island since 1997, in addition research into its status; has been carried out on Mahé island. The species was more abundant in the past and many known; roosts have been abandoned. The causes of decline have been speculated to include disturbance; and predation but studies of the roosts suggest that habitat change may be the most significant; factor. The species occupies small caves in boulder fields in lowland woodland which has been; extensively invaded by introduced plants. These plants support reduced numbers of insects,; especially Coleoptera. Lepidoptera and Coleoptera dominate the diet with a strong preference for; the latter before and during the breeding season. Habitat management on Silhouette has removed; alien plants from around the roosts and improved foraging conditions for the bat resulting in an; increase in breeding activity. The population at La Passe on Silhouette has increased from 14-25; individuals in the 1990s to 40 in 2009. In 2010 this colony fragmented with 18-20 individuals; leaving to start a second colony at Anse Lascars.

509,1981,Population ecology of blunt-nosed leopard lizards in high elevation foothill habitat,"We captured 1078 Blunt-Nosed Leopard Lizards (Gambelia sila) 2396 times between 1989 and 1994 on the Elkhorn Plain, San Luis Obispo County, California. Based on size at first capture, we caught 119 adult (>= 90 mm snout-vent length (SVL)) and 430 hatchling/juvenile ( 90 mm SVL) males, and 139 adult and 390 hatchling/juvenile females. Sex ratio of males to females was 1.04 (549 males/529 females). Adult G. sila generally became active in April, and activity remained relatively high into July. Hatchlings were first noted in either July or August and generally could be found until early November, except in 1990 when no hatchlings were found at any time. Mean number of adults and hatchlings found active each day differed significantly across years, but as many as 32 adults and 42 hatchlings were seen on a plot during a census. Estimates of population abundance on a plot also varied yearly from 20-164 adults and 0-273 hatchling/juveniles and seemed to be affected either by too little or too much rain. Differences in daily activity varied and were moderately well explained by environmental factors. We estimated survivorship of lizards and found 29.0% of hatchlings from 1992 survived to 1993, and 14.6% of hatchlings from 1993 survived to 1994. The oldest G. sila found was a female estimated to be 4 years, 10 months when last caught, although most adults were not seen after 2 yr. Growth of individuals varied by year: highest growth rates were for lizards that hatched in 1991 and 1992, and lowest growth occurred in lizards that hatched in 1989. We found adult leopard lizards with eggs in all years but 1990. Females generally were gravid by late April or early May, and some females were found with eggs in early July. Female size at first reproduction was about 90 mm SVL, clutch size ranged from 1-6 eggs, and overall mean clutch size regardless of year or clutch order was 3.4 eggs. Many females produced multiple clutches in a year, and we found up to four clutches by a single female."
510,4449,Critical Decline of the Eastern Caribbean Sperm Whale Population,"Sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) populations were expected to rebuild following the end of commercial whaling. We document the decline of the population in the eastern Caribbean by tracing demographic changes of well-studied social units. We address hypotheses that, over a ten-year period of dedicated effort (20052015), unit size, numbers of calves and/or calving rates have each declined. Across 16 units, the number of adults decreased in 12 units, increased in two, and showed no change in two. The number of adults per unit decreased at -0.195 individuals/yr (95% CI: -0.080 to -0.310; P = 0.001). The number of calves also declined, but the decline was not significant. This negative trend of -4.5% per year in unit size started in about 2010, with numbers being fairly stable until then. There are several natural and anthropogenic threats, but no well-substantiated cause for the decline."
511,1457,Non-recovery of two spotted and spinner dolphin populations in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.,"Populations of northeastern offshore spotted dolphins Stenella attenuata attenuata and eastern spinner dolphins S. longirostris orientalis have been reduced because the dolphins are bycatch in the purse-seine fishery for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (the 'tuna-dolphin issue'). Abundance and trends of these dolphin stocks were assessed from 12 large-scale pelagic surveys carried out between 1979 and 2000. Estimates of abundance were based on a multivariate line-transect analysis, using covariates to model the detection process and group size. Current estimates of abundance are about 640 000 northeastern offshore spotted dolphins (CV = 0.17) and 450 000 eastern spinner dolphins (CV = 0.23). For the whole period from 1979 to 2000, annual estimates of abundance ranged from 494 000 to 954 000 for northeastern offshore spotted dolphins and from 271 000 to 734 000 for eastern spinner dolphins. Management actions by USA and international fishing agencies over 3 decades have successfully reduced dolphin bycatch by 2 orders of magnitude, yet neither stock is showing clear signs of recovery. Possible reasons include underreporting of dolphin bycatch, effects of chase and encirclement on dolphin survival and reproduction, long-term changes in the ecosystem, and effects of other species on spotted and spinner dolphin population dynamics.

512,2865,Spatial distribution and temporal changes in the fish populations of Lake Victoria,"The fisheries of Lake Victoria in East Africa must be managed effectively to ensure sustainable food supplies. This has been impossible in the past due to inadequate knowledge of commercially important fish stocks. Here we present the first acoustic abundance estimates of fish in Lake Victoria. Five lakewide acoustic surveys were conducted between 1999 and 2001, using the Simrad EY500 echo-integrator with a 120 kHz split-beam transducer. There are many species of fish in Lake Victoria, however, only limited identification of targets can be achieved by present methods. Broad categories were distinguished by visual examination of echo-traces. The echo-integrals were partitioned between four target groups: (1) the Nile perch (Lates niloticus), a top predator, (2) small pelagics comprising mainly the dagaa Rastrineobola argentea together with mixed species of haplochromines, (3) the crustacean Caridina nilotica and (4) other species. Spatial and temporal differences in the Standing Crop were observed between north and south, and between shallow and deep water. Most fish were found inshore but the spatial distribution varied between seasons. Mid-lake fish densities were higher in August compared to February. In August, the water column is well mixed while in February it is stratified with a low-oxygen layer inhospitable to fish near the bottom. There are consequent changes in the characteristics of observed echo-traces. Over the survey series, Nile perch biomass showed a consistent decline, while the stocks of small pelagic species increased. We emphasize the need for simple rules to identify species, and hydrographic monitoring to assist echo-trace classification. In the absence of any other source of comprehensive biomass estimates, the value of acoustic surveying in Lake Victoria is demonstrated. "
513,2606,"Population Trend and Breeding Biology of Gentoo Penguin in Martillo Island, Tierra Del Fuego, Argentina","Data on population size and some aspects of the breeding biology of Gentoo Penguins (Pygocelis papua) have been studied as part of a long-term monitoring program at Martillo Island in the Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego. The colony of Gentoo Penguin on Martillo Island is the only one reported in Argentina and has been monitored regularly since 2000. Timing and hatching success were similar to those reported at other colonies in the South Atlantic Ocean/Antarctic Peninsula region. A maximum of twelve nests were recorded during the 2006/2007 season, with an average breeding success of 1.0 chicks/nest. The Gentoo Penguin colony at Martillo Island increased by 19% in the past 13 y, while other colonies in the south Atlantic region and the Antarctic Peninsula have been decreasing or stable."
514,2588,Anthropogenic influence on an urban colony of the little penguin Eudyptula minor,"Native animals exploit resources in cities and inhabit anthropogenic structures worldwide. One example of this is the little penguin, Eudyptula minor, population nesting between boulders on the St Kilda breakwater in Melbourne. This population is attracted by safe hiding places, a lack of predators and the presence of prey. However, living close to urbanisation poses many threats to the colony, including boating, lighting, noise and human visitation. We investigated the effects of human disturbance by comparing the number of penguins and breeding sites in the publicly accessible region with those in the restricted region of the breakwater. Penguins and nest sites were not equally distributed along the breakwater, with the mean number of birds and nest sites present per 20-m section in the restricted region significantly greater (typically double) than the number in the publicly accessible region. Although the penguins show a clear preference to nest in the restricted region of the breakwater, their continued presence in the publicly accessible region when nest sites are not limiting indicates that human disturbance is not incompatible with some nesting activity. In a global context these results illustrate some of the benefits and costs to animals that use anthropogenically altered habitats and urban environments."
515,2871,"Historical biomass, fishing mortality, and recruitment trends of the Campeche Bank red grouper (Epinephelus morio)","This study describes the historical evolution of the biomass, fishing mortality per age group, annual recruitment, and catchability of the Campeche Bank red grouper population. This fishery is based on three fleets (the Mexican Minor, the Mexican Major or Industrial, and the Cuban) with different capacities, areas of operation, and targeting of different age groups. During the last 10 years, the Minor fleet expanded, resulting in some overlapping with the other fleets areas. The biomass of the population of the red grouper in the Campeche Bank has decreased between 1986 and 2000. This decrease is evident from the commercial landings (from 14,4 10 to 9797 t) and in CPUE from independent research surveys (from 3.8 to 1.5 kg/100 hooks). The size of the spawning stock has decreased 25% since the beginning of the period, as well as the recruitment (from 24 to 11 million, 1-2 years old), while the catchability coefficient has increased (from 0.2 to 0.4). "
516,1683,Abundance and spatial distribution of Greater Rhea Rhea americana in two sites on the pampas grasslands with different land use,"In Argentina the original landscape structure of the pampas grasslands has changed rapidly due to intensified and specialized agricultural practices. The conversion of grasslands into croplands has been suggested as a threat to Greater Rhea Rhea americana populations. The main goals of this study were to estimate the abundance of Greater Rheas and to analyse the species' spatial distribution at two sites of the pampas region with different land use: agro-ecosystem and grassland. The former was mainly devoted to crop production whereas the latter was mostly used for livestock grazing. Data were collected through 14 aerial surveys from 1998 to 2001, and in 2004. Each survey consisted of six strip-transects per site, spaced at regular intervals. The total area surveyed represented 4% of each study site (113 km2 in the grassland and 95 km2 in the agro-ecosystem). Greater Rhea density (±SE) was significantly higher in the grassland (from 0.22 ±0.11 to 0.86 ± 0.24 ind. km-2) than in the agro-ecosystem (from 0.05 ± 0.05 to 0.12 ± 0.08 ind. km-2). Greater Rheas occupied 51% of the study area in the grassland but less than 5% in the agro-ecosystem. They showed a wide and uniform spatial distribution in the former area, whereas in the latter individuals occurred in small and isolated clusters. These results raise concern about the future of the species because, over recent years, land has been increasingly used for crop production. Hence, if the current rate of change in land use continues, the conservation status of this species will be seriously affected. "
517,1456,Population trends and spatial synchrony in peripheral populations of the endangered Lesser grey shrike in response to environmental change.,"Regional synchronization in species dynamics as well as particular ecological and demographic characteristics of peripheral populations poses special challenges for conservation purposes, particularly under the current scenario of global climate change. Here, we study the population trend and spatial synchrony of several peripheral populations of the endangered Lesser grey shrike Lanius minor at the western limit of its breeding range (southern France and northeast Spain). In an attempt to ascertain the effect of environmental change on the decline of the species we also look for evidence of climate changes in the breeding and wintering area of this shrike and related effects on vegetation by using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We found that the interannual fluctuations of the peripheral populations in France and Spain are strongly correlated, therefore suggesting that their decline can be under the influence of a common factor. We obtained clear evidence of climatic change (an increased thermal oscillation) in one peripheral population that could have resulted in a decrease of the NDVI index in the area. Our study finds correlational evidence that climatic variables in the breeding area may account for fluctuations in abundances of some populations and that environmental conditions experimented by some population could influence the fate of the neighboring populations. Our results indicate that the studied peripheral populations are spatially synchronized, so that conservation efforts should be applied at a large-scale encompassing all the isolated populations at the western border of the range of the species in the Mediterranean area.

518,2019,"Leatherback turtles, Dermochelys coriacea, nesting in French Guiana, 1978-1995","Ya:lima:po beach in French Guiana exhibits the highest concentration of leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) nesting in the world. Scientists and volunteers from more than 25 countries have worked within the Kawana marine turtle project for 16 years. Numbering and tagging of leatherbacks has been the main activity of this project. Number of nests per year has been estimated for 13 nesting seasons between 1978 and 1995. More than 50 thousand nestings were recorded annually in 1988 and 1992, but only 10 to 15 thousand annually in 1978-86, 1993, and 1995, with intermediate numbers of 20 to 30 thousand annually in 1987, 1989, 1991, and 1994. A general increase in the number of nests has been observed in the last few years as compared to the first years, but the actual trend is unclear. Analysis of the database of tagged leatherbacks (over 31,000 data points) elucidates behavior of this species within and between nesting seasons."
519,4021,Nesting estimation and analysis of threats for Critically Endangered leatherback Dermochelys coriacea and Endangered olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea marine turtles nesting in Congo,"Six marine turtle species are reported from the coastal waters of the Republic of the Congo. Among them, nesting by the Critically Endangered leatherback Dermochelys coriacea and Endangered olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea marine turtles occurs annually from September to April on Congolese beaches. We developed a methodology to model the nesting season of marine turtles and apply it to the time series of nest counts for six nesting beaches monitored over 2-4 years. There is a peak of nesting activity in early January for leatherback turtles and early December for olive ridley turtles. We show a decline of olive ridley nests during this period whereas leatherback nesting increased, and propose that differential threats for these two species explain such a contrasted pattern. "
520,1405,Variation in fish community composition along an Iberian river from low to high discharge: relative contributions of environmental and temporal variables.,"Factors associated with the spatial and temporal variation of the lower Guadiana basin (southern Iberia) fish communit were determined using data from 20 sites sampled during the summer of 1994 (dry year following a period of low discharge, total discharge from 1992 to 1994=1.45X109 m3) and again during the summer of 1996 (wet year following a period of higher discharge, total discharge from January 1995 to August 1996=6.18X109 m3). From the 17 explanatory variables initially considered six were retained for analysis by a forward selection procedure: maximum depth, altitude, channel width, substrate coarseness, SALT (a dummy variable identifying sampling locations belonging to tributaries that discharge to the brackish Guadiana) and YEAR (a dummy variable identifying the sampling year). Further, we partitioned the total variability in the Guadiana fish community into that accounted uniquely by selected environmental variables (34.9%), uniquely by sampling year (4.1%), by both sampling year and environmental variables (0.3%), and unexplained (60.7%)."
521,2983,Decline in sea snake abundance on a protected coral reef system in the New Caledonian Lagoon,"Monitoring results from a small reef (Ile aux Canards) near Noumea in the New Caledonian Lagoon reveal that numbers of turtle-headed sea snakes (Emydocephalus annulatus) have been in consistent decline over a 9-year period, with average daily counts of snakes decreasing from >6 to <2 over this period. Causal factors for the decline are unclear, because the site is a protected area used only for tourism. Our results suggest that wildlife management authorities should carefully monitor sea snake populations to check whether the declines now documented for New Caledonia and in nearby Australian waters also occur around the islands of the Indo-Pacific.

522,1313,Aspects of the population ecology of the Green and golden bell frog Litoria aurea at the northern end of its range.,"Development of appropriate conservation programs for threatened species requires a basic understanding of their population ecology. We studied a population of the Green and golden bell frog Litoria aurea in the far north of its range. This population occupies a coastal lagoon within Yuraygir National Park. Permanent tagging of frogs was conducted between August 1998 and March 2003. Population estimation based on the mark and recapture of frogs in 1998-99 suggested that the population contained at least 100 adult male frogs. Approximately 75 male bell frogs called from around the lagoon on one night in November 2001. The number of females captured in any year was low and it is unclear whether this is due to low detectability associated with irregular use of breeding sites or a highly skewed sex ratio. More than 60% of tagged male frogs were recaptured across one active season, but only two were recaptured outside the season of initial capture. This suggests that few male frogs live longer than about 2 years as adults. Breeding was erratic over a 6-year period and only one major metamorphosis event was observed. It appears that bell frogs may have greater breeding success in ephemeral ponds forming away from the lagoon, though there is a risk that these ponds may not persist for tadpoles to complete development. Frogs in this northern population were predominantly brown in colour, suggesting some morphological and genetic differentiation from southern populations in which most frogs are predominantly green. Further study of this important population is needed to more adequately determine the size of the female component of the population, and to better understand the limits on successful breeding. These issues will influence our understanding of the viability of the population, and therefore our ability to devise appropriate management actions. This study provides the first published account of aspects of the population ecology of the Green and golden bell frog in relatively undisturbed natural habitat."
523,1712,Demography and dispersal patterns of a Tamarin population: possible causes of delayed breeding,"Saddle-back tamarins Saguinus fuscicollis in Peru live in small groups with 1 reproductive female and 1-2 breeding males. Most animals do not first breed for at least 1yr past the age of potential sexual maturity. Data on survival of adults and lengths of tenure of breeders suggest that breeding vacancies are not frequent. Emigration and survival patterns are not significantly different for the sexes. Delayed first breeding may occur in this species for any or all of the following reasons: a shortage of breeding positions, territories, or helpers; the risks of solitary dispersal; and the inclusive fitness benefits gained from helping. -from Authors"
524,1519,"Long-term direct and indirect effects of the ‘Exxon Valdez’ oil spill on pigeon guillemots in Prince William Sound, Alaska.","We conducted a study to determine mechanisms constraining population recovery of pigeon guillemots Cepphus columba following the 1989 'Exxon Valdez' oil spill. We asked whether recovery was limited by continuing exposure to residual oil, reduced prey availability, or other causes. Our approach was to compare demographic, physiological, and behavioral parameters between an oiled site pre- and post-spill, and between the oiled site and an unoiled site post-spill. Adult mass, body condition, and nestling survival were significantly lower at the oiled site post-spill compared to pre-spill. After the spill, guillemots increased in number at the unoiled site and chicks fledged at significantly heavier weights than at the oiled site, where populations remained depressed. Elevated hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activities detected in adult guillemots a decade after the spill at the oiled site suggest that continued exposure to residual oil may have limited population recovery, although reduced availability of sand lance, a preferred forage fish, may have also played a role. Previous studies conducted at the oiled site demonstrated that guillemot chick growth and reproductive success were positively related to the percentage of high-lipid forage fishes, such as sand lance, in the chick diet. Aspects of sand lance life history and the pattern of 'Exxon Valdez' oil deposition strongly suggest that sand lance were impacted by the spill, although we lack direct evidence of this, and reductions in this species' abundance may have also resulted from natural causes. Our study suggests that the recovery of a top-level generalist predator may be constrained by both direct effects (continued exposure to residual oil) and indirect effects (reduced availability of a key prey species) following a large-scale perturbation. Furthermore, it demonstrates that recovery following oil spills may take considerably longer for certain species than the few years that have been proposed as typical for marine birds."

This is the first density estimate for ocelots; in the Brazilian Amazon, which is an important stronghold for the species."
526,1878,"An assessment of the sustainability of the hake Merluccius hubbsi artisanal fishery in San Mat´ıas Gulf, Patagonia, Argentina","Two fleets currently operate in the common hake fishery of San Matías Gulf, Argentina: artisanal longliners and industrial bottom trawlers. Annual landings reach more than 15,000 metric tones and the annual gross rent exceeds US$ 10 million. This fishery has been included recently in a certification program of Sustainable Fishing. Taking into consideration some principles a sustainability analysis we performed focused on assessing the impacts of fishing on marine resources and the ecosystem. Interactions between fleets and between operational units of the artisanal fleet are assessed. In addition, we evaluated the way this fishery is been managed in the area. A description of the problems detected in the artisanal sector and corrective actions for their solutions are presented. Information about by-catch and discards, loss of fishing gear and interactions with marine birds and mammals is also presented. These topics are critically discussed in the context of the sustainable fishery management. "
527,4261,Decline of a montane Mediterranean pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca population in relation to climate,"Certain populations of long-distance migratory birds are suffering declines, which may be attributed to effects of climatechange.  In this article, we have analysed a long-term (19912015) data set on a pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca population; breeding in nest-boxes in a Mediterranean montane oak forest, exploring the trends in population size due to changes in; nestling recruitment, female survival and female immigration. We have related these changes in population parameters to; local climate, winter NAO index and to breeding density. During the last 25 yr the population has declined by half, mainly; in association with a decrease in nestling mass and structural size which had repercussions on the probability of nestling; recruitment to the population. Lower local nestling recruitment in certain years was linked to lower female immigration; rate in the same years. On the other hand, the local survival of females remained stable throughout the study period. Laying; date and breeding success were negatively affected by local temperatures while breeding, recruitment rate likewise by; minimum temperature prior to breeding in April. As minimum April temperatures have increased across the study period,; this may have affected recruitment and immigration rates negatively. On the other hand, tarsus length and body mass of; nestlings were positively associated with winter NAO index, pointing to more global climatic links. Moreover, there was; also a negative temporal trend in body mass of adults, implying increasingly difficult conditions for breeding. Declining; recruit production in the study area could be attributed to a mismatch between the timing of arrival and breeding in the; population, and the peak of food availability in this area."
528,2441,Demographical analysis of the pink ling Genypterus blacodes (Schneider 1801) in the austral demersal fishery: A matrix approach evaluating harvest and non-harvest states,"In this work we model the population dynamics of Genypterus blacodes of the demersal fishery on Chilean southern-austral region, using stage structured matrices, from a 17-year time-series of annual age-specific female abundances. For the parameterized matrices obtained, we calculated population growth rates with confidence intervals, net reproductive rate. reproductive value, stable stage structure, and we performed a sensitivity analysis.We also generated and analyzed an analogous stage structured matrix model for the same population assuming no harvesting. The main results are (1) a negative growth rate for the observed population data: (2) a positive growth rate for the population without the capture effect which is significantly different from the growth rate of the harvested population; (3) the sensitivity analysis revealed that [lambda] is more sensitive to variations in adult survival in the age class 7-10 years; (4) the observed population exhibits a stable stage structure.

529,1048,"Foraging partitioning between giant petrels Macronectes spp. and its relationship with breeding population changes at Bird Island, South Georgia. ","We satellite-tracked the foraging trips of males and females of the 2 sibling species of giant petrels, Macronectes halli and M. giganteus, breeding sympatrically at Bird Island (South Georgia, Antarctica), during the incubation period (November-December). Size of the activity range in addition to speed and distance covered on foraging trips were similar between the species, but were lower for males than for females in both species. Sex-specific differences agree with previous observations on diets and on attendance at seal carcasses, suggesting that females mainly forage at sea, whereas males mainly scavenge on the coast. Overall, however, the foraging ecology of both species seems very similar. Interspecific and intersexual competition may be reduced by the limited overlap in the at-sea range, with southern giant petrels foraging further south than did northern giant petrels, and females further west than males, suggesting some spatial partitioning in foraging areas. Male northern giant petrels foraged almost exclusively on the South Georgia coast; their strong dependence during the brooding and chick-rearing period on Antarctic fur seals, whose population has increased exponentially in recent years, may be reflected in the recent population increase of northern giant petrels at South Georgia. Foraging areas of giant petrels overlapped extensively with longline fishery distribution, highlighting their susceptibility to being caught on longline hooks. Females were at higher risk during the study period since they made longer trips and foraged further west than males, into areas where local longline fisheries are more active."
530,2654,"Evaluating the status of the Endangered tiger Panthera tigris and its prey in Panna Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh, India","We evaluated the status of tigers Panthera tigris and their prey in Panna Tiger Reserve using occupancy surveys, camera-trap mark-recapture population estimation, and distance sampling along foot transects, in 2006. Forest Range tiger occupancy in the Panna landscape (3,500 km2) estimated by 1,077 surveys of 5 km each was 29% [plus or minus] SE 1. Within occupied Ranges of the Reserve a mean of 68% [plus or minus] SE 7 of forest Beats had tiger signs. A total of 800 camera-trap nights yielded 24 captures of seven individual adult tigers within an effective trap area of 185.0 [plus or minus] SE 15.8 km-2. The best model incorporating individual heterogeneity (Mh) estimated the tiger population to be 9 [plus or minus] SE 2. Tiger density was 4.9 [plus or minus] SE 1.5 per 100 km2 and was lower than that reported in 2002 (6.49 tigers per 100 km2). Both occupancy and density indicated a decline of the tiger population in the Reserve. Mean ungulate density was 42.4 [plus or minus] SE 8.4 km-2 and comparable to other tiger reserves. Since our survey in 2006 tiger status in Panna has deteriorated further because of poaching. Panna was occupied by dacoits in late 2006 and anti-insurgent activities caused further disturbances. In late 2008 there was a single male tiger left in Panna but he has not been seen since January 2009. The Madhya Pradesh Forest department has reintroduced three tigers to Panna from neighbouring tiger reserves. Panna, along with Sariska Tiger Reserve, exemplifies the vulnerability of small, isolated tiger populations to local extinctions caused by poaching, even in areas with suitable habitat and sufficient prey."
531,3633,"Spatial and temporal distribution of commercially important fish species of Lake Tana, Ethiopia","The distribution of Lake Tana fish species was studied from January 2000 to December 2003. Samples were collected monthly using gill-nets of 60, 80, 100, 120 and 140 mm stretched mesh size. Labeobarbus spp., Oreochromis niloticus, Claris gariepinus and Varicorhinus beso are commercially important fish species and form 77%, 13%, 9% and 1% of the pooled experimental fish catch. There was significant variability among years and sampling sites encompassing both temporal and spatial aspects. Population densities of Labeobarbus spp. and V. beso were significantly declining, in contrast, the abundance of O. niloticus and C. gariepinus did not change. The most likely explanations for the decline in Labeobarbus spp. are the increase of the commercial gill-net fishery targeting their spawning aggregations in the river mouths, use of poisonous plant materials and the increasing trend of the dis-connectivity and channelisation of rivers. The results stress the need for urgent development of a management plan focusing on ensuring river connectivity, fishing effort and gear restrictions, and control in the river mouths and major tributaries during the breeding seasons."
532,2933,Changes in the density and spatial distribution of red fox dens and cub numbers in central Poland following rabies vaccination.,"Increases in red fox Vulpes vulpes (Linnaeus, 1758) numbers and densities have been found in all European countries involved in the rabies vaccination program. In Poland, the number of foxes has increased steadily since the 1990s. Between 1999-2000, the average density of foxes reached 1.3-2 ind./km 2 in some parts of the country. The aim of the study was to estimate the change in fox population densities in central Poland during 1980-2006, and to assess the effect these changes have had on the spatial distribution of natal dens, mean numbers of cubs observed at occupied dens and the sedentary/nomadic fox ratio. Estimations of fox population density and numbers were based on three methods: (1) counts of tracks in snow, (2) locations of natal dens and counts of cubs, and (3) the battue (driving) method. The three methods of assessment were used continuously in our study area over a period of 25 years. Average yearly results were analysed and comparisons made between the periods before and after implementation of the anti-rabies vaccination. The results obtained with all three methods show a significant increase in the fox population, when the two analysed periods are compared. Increases in fox population densities correlated with increased numbers of breeding sites being located outside forests, from only single ones in the 1980s to 24% of the total in 2005. The average number of cubs per occupied den decreased significantly (by 11%) in comparison with before the anti-rabies vaccination period. The great increase (more than 100%) in fox numbers observed using the battue (driving) method suggest, that nomadic animals can form an important part of winter population in our study area."
533,1732,"Demography and population dynamics in the elephants Loxodonta africana of Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa: is there evidence of density dependent regulation?","Density dependence of the Addo Elephant National Park (South Africa) elephants Loxodonta africana was assessed using a long-term data set. Estimated carrying capacity is 0.1-0.5 elephants km-2 but stocking rates have been up to 4 elephants km-2. Population growth rate was found to be positively correlated with increasing density. There was no relationship between birth rate, the age of first calving or calf sex ratio and elephant density but there was a positive relationship between birth rate and rainfall during conception year. Mortality rates, particularly for juveniles, were low, and mean inter-calf interval was 3.3 years. There is no evidence of density dependent regulation in this population, despite the population being consistently above the estimated sustainable carrying capacity and a loss of phytomass and biodiversity. This is interpreted in light of the characteristics of the aseasonal habitat, succulent thicket vegetation and the ability of elephants to utilize accumulated vegetation biomass. These findings indicate that density dependence should not be considered as an option in the control of elephant numbers in this Park, or where elephant resources are not seasonally limited. "
534,3270,"Evaluation of the ornithological importance of the Alyki Kitrous wetland, Macedonia, Greece: a priority for conservation","The ornithological importance of the Alyki Kitrous wetland (Macedonia, Greece) is evaluated for five groups of birds of special conservation interest by comparison with existing criteria. Ten raptor species (six protected in the EC) occurred but in small numbers. Herons also occurred in small numbers, but wintering great white egrets Egretta alba and wintering and summering spoon-bills Platalea leucorodia occurred in numbers of international importance. Waterfowl were especially abundant in winter, but Alyki was of international importance only for shelduck Tadorna tadorna, although in the past it had also been important for Eurasian wigeons Anas penelope. Alyki was also nationally important for the most abundant wintering anatid species, and for overall numbers, and has been occasionally important for coots. Waders were most abundant in spring migration: avocets Recurvirostra avosetta (during most of the year) and collared-pratincoles Glareola pratincola (in summer) occurred in internationally important numbers. Of breeding waders the same species were important in numbers both internationally and nationally. The latter category also included black-winged stilts Himantopus himantopus. Larids formed one of the most abundant groups, and Alyki was internationally important for particular breeding species such as Mediterranean gulls Larus melanocephalus and gull-billed terns Gelochelidon nilotica. It was also nationally important for breeding common Sterna hirundo and little S. albifrons terns and wintering and breeding slender-billed gulls Larus genei. The Alyki Kitrous wetland is threatened by illegal building and unscheduled development of the salines in the area. Priority conservation measures are proposed. "
535,2067,Introduced bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) in western Canada: has their ecology diverged?,"Organisms can diverge in life history when introduced outside their native range due to release from predators, competitors, and parasites, and also due to genetic drift and local adaptation. We studied the ecology of the American Bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) in its introduced range in British Columbia (BC). To assess differences between introduced and native populations, we compared the population ecology of BC bullfrogs to published life-history parameters from the bullfrog's extensive native range in eastern North America. In BC, bullfrogs emerged from hibernation in late April and early May. Breeding choruses developed fully when air temperatures exceeded 20[degree]C. Eggs were laid from mid-June to mid-July when the mean water temperature was 20[degree]C. Mean egg mass size was 13,014 [plus or minus] 7,296 eggs (mean [plus or minus] standard deviation). Tadpoles hatched in 3 to 5 days and overwintered the first year as tadpoles. Approximately 68% of the tadpoles metamorphosed at the end of the following summer, but the remaining spent a second winter in the pond. Bullfrogs were large enough to attain sexual maturity 2 yr after metamorphosis. Bullfrog population density among ponds varied from 4.1 to 530 frogs/ha. Terrestrial insects were the primary prey item of bullfrogs < 150 g, whereas frogs were the primary prey item of larger bullfrogs. The life-history parameter values estimated for BC bullfrogs were within the range observed for bullfrogs in their native habitats. Due to milder weather conditions in southwestern BC, the seasonal pattern and growth rate of bullfrogs were similar to lower latitude populations in Kentucky and Missouri. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that when released from native predators and parasites bullfrogs build up to unusually high population densities or attain significantly larger sizes in their introduced range."
536,4423,Effects of climate change and environmental variability on the carrying capacity of Alaskan seabird populations,"Marine birds in Alaska, USA, have been monitored systematically for more than 4 decades, and yet it remains unclear why some populations have increased while others have declined. We analyzed the population dynamics of 5 seabird species-Black-legged (Rissa tridactyla) and Red-legged kittiwakes (R. brevirostris), Common (Uria aalge) and Thick-billed murres (U. lomvia), and Tufted Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata)-across 4 decades in Alaska. We tested hypotheses that each species' carrying capacity varied continuously through time with climate cycles and/or in response to habitat covariates. Using an information-theoretic approach, we evaluated competing candidate stochastic growth models of each species' annual rate of change, incorporating various environmental covariates. The North Pacific Index and Pacific Decadal Oscillation were the most important climatic covariates across the whole of Alaska, where the former generally was negatively related to rates of population change, and the latter positively related. Across the 40-yr time series, we found slight decreases in zooplankton (i.e. krill) concentrations across the Gulf of Alaska, and significant increases in sea surface temperature across the Aleutian Islands. Kittiwakes showed the greatest level of sensitivity to these 2 environmental changes. Our results provide evidence that deteriorating secondary productivity (i.e. euphausiids) has contributed to declines of Black-legged Kittiwakes in the Gulf of Alaska. In contrast, the carrying capacity of murres has increased across the state, even in regions affected by warming waters and reduced productivity. These results suggest that kittiwakes act as indicators of detrimental impacts of climatic variability, whereas murres demonstrate resilience to such environmental change. Identifying the ecological factors that explain seabird population dynamics is necessary to understand the implications of climate and environmental change for long-term marine ecosystem dynamics."
537,4630,"The 30-year recovery effort for the Ozark cavefish (Amblyopsis rosae): Analysis of current distribution, population trends, and conservation status of this threatened species","Here we review the thirty year recovery effort and conservation status of the Ozark cavefish, Amblyopsis rosae. We summarized the historic and current range of the species, and report county range extensions for both A. rosae and its confamilial Typhlichthys subterraneus. Ozark cavefish survey data spanning almost a century were analyzed for temporal trends using the Mann-Kendall Test/Sen's Slope Estimator Method. Results were inconclusive because variance was high and the majority of data sets were not sufficiently large to detect a trend. However, the two largest populations (Cave Springs Cave and Logan Cave, Benton Co., Arkansas) have stabilizing or increasing survey counts. While the number of active cavefish sites has decreased over 50% since 1990, the number of surveyed individuals has not. Reasons for endangerment were reanalyzed since federal listing; the primary threat has shifted from overcollection to habitat degradation. We analyzed the progress of recovery task implementation, and we critically evaluated the basis of delisting criteria. Recovery Task 1, the hydrogeologic delineation of subterranean habitats, is almost complete. Recovery Task 2 prescribes protection and management for Recovery Caves, and important progress has been made. Recovery Task 3 involves the development and implementation of monitoring programs in Recovery Caves. Several important studies have been performed, and indicate that many cavefish populations are experiencing chronic, low-level exposure to a suite of anthropogenic contaminants. Delisting conditions are largely unattainable as currently worded. We suggest that recovery criteria be amended such that habitat protection goals are attainable, that the list of Recovery Caves can be periodically updated, and that the recovery population goal is increased and distributed between more sites.

538,2394,"Demographic dynamics of the afro-tropical pig-nosed frog, Hemisus marmoratus: effects of climate and predation on survival and recruitment","We studied the population ecology of the West African pig-nosed frog, Hemisus marmoratus, to understand the relative contributions of adult survival and recruitment to population growth rate in savannah frogs using mark-recapture modelling. We marked a total of 821 adult frogs over 6 years and recaptured 74 at least once between years. Between-year adult survival was sex-specific and varied between 0.06 and 0.53 for males and 0.07-0.41 for females. Adult survival was significantly associated with annual rainfall and is cause for concern if rainfall declines further in the study region as predicted by changes in the global climate. There was a significant interaction between rainfall and sex with dry weather having a stronger negative effect on males than females. Pig-nosed frogs experienced boom and bust years with a single decline more dramatic than increases. Recruitment (in situ and immigration; 0.67-0.88) was substantially more important than adult survival (0.12-0.33) in determining realised population growth. In situ recruitment was highly variable between years with 1-36% of eggs and tadpoles released by females into the pond surviving to metamorphosis. Years of low tadpole survival were associated with high numbers of predatory tortoises. Thus, like other pond-breeding anurans, pig-nosed frogs showed highly variable juvenile recruitment, low adult survival and density-independent effects on population growth by predators and weather."
539,2873,Changes in relative abundance of sharks and rays on Australian South East Fishery trawl grounds after twenty years of fishing,"Upper continental slope trawling grounds (200-650 m depth) off New South Wales were surveyed with the same vessel and trawl gear and similar sampling protocols in 1976-77 (during the early years of commercial exploitation) and in 1996-97. The 1996-97 mean catch rate of sharks and rays, pooled for the main 15 species (or species groups), was [approximately]20% of the 1976-77 mean. Individual catch rates were substantially lower in 1996-97 for 13 of the 15 species or species groups. The greatest decline was observed for dogsharks of the genus Centrophorus, which were most abundant in 1976-77 but rarely caught 20 years later. In contrast, 1996-97 catch rates of spiky dogshark (Squalus megalops) and, to a lesser extent, whitefin swell shark (Cephaloscyllium sp. A) were similar to those in 1976-77. Trawling during 1979-81 provided data for nine species, albeit not corrected for larger gear size, and the pooled mean catch rate for sharks and rays in the depth range 300-525 m was [approximately]28% of the mean for 1976-77. The results suggest that the biomass of most species of sharks and rays declined rapidly as the fishery developed and is now at very low levels."
540,3505,Coral mortality versus structural collapse as drivers of corallivorous butterflyfish decline,"As climate change increasingly threatens biodiversity, identifying specific drivers of species loss as well as the attributes of species most vulnerable to climatic disturbances is a key challenge to ecologists and conservationists. Here we assess the effects of coral loss versus declines in structural complexity on obligate and facultative coral feeding butterflyfishes on coral reefs in the central and western Indian Ocean. In the inner Seychelles, the abundance of the obligate coral feeding group declined markedly in response to live coral mortality (r2 = 0.48), but showed no further decline with respect to erosion of the physical matrix of the reef. Conversely, the facultative feeding group showed no decline in response to live coral loss, reflecting their feeding versatility; however they did decline in response to structural erosion of the reef framework (r2 = 0.26). There were no significant changes in either obligate or facultative corallivore abundances at a reference location (Chagos archipelago), highlighting that butterflyfish populations are stable in the absence of habitat disturbance. While specialised coral dependant fishes are highly vulnerable to coral loss caused by climate-induced coral bleaching, the structural collapse of dead coral colonies may have significant, but more variable, impacts across a wide range of fishes. If conservation and mitigation planning are to be effective, there is a clear need to better understand the mechanisms of reef structural collapse and the dynamics of system recovery following large-scale disturbance."
541,1894,"Assessing the size, growth rate and structure of a seasonal population of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus Smith 1828) using conventional tagging and photo identification","Population size and structure of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) remain unknown despite their economic importance to targeted tourism and fisheries and their 2002 listing on CITES Appendix II. Here, we present results from the first whale shark population study in the Western Hemisphere and describe the inherent difficulties of assessing populations using catch-independent methods in free-ranging sharks. From 1998 to 2003, we identified 106 whale sharks using their distinctive scars and spot patterns following 521 encounters at a predictable seasonal aggregation on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef linked to snapper spawning aggregations at Gladden Spit, Belize. Encountered sharks measured a mean total length of 6.3 m [plus or minus] 1.7 m S.D. and a range of 3.0-12.7 m (n = 317). Sexual and size segregation is suggested: 31 % of encountered sharks (n = 162) were sexed, of which 86% were immature males. Between 1999 and 2002, 70 sharks were tagged with 72 conventional tags and measured sharks (n = 63) possessed a mean length of 6.0 m [plus or minus] 1.6 m S.D. (range 3.0-9.7 m). Growth rates for three resighted sharks ranged from an estimated 0.03-0.70 m year-1. Resightings of tagged sharks elsewhere on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef indicate that the population is not resident at Gladden Spit and is shared with two other sites possessing seasonal aggregations: Isla Contoy, Mexico and Utila, Honduras. Monitoring whale shark populations at Gladden Spit and the other aggregation sites on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef underpins the region's lucrative and burgeoning whale shark tourism and is key to their local and international conservation.

542,4258,Catastrophic impact of wild boars: insufficient hunting pressure pushes snakes to the brink," Climatic changes, habitat loss and invasive species are important threats for many animal populations. Here, we report rapid declines and extinctions of adder populations monitored during 12 years in Belgium where none of the above causes was involved. This study provides the first large-scale data showing that wild boars represent a major risk for snakes, pushing populations to extinction. Drastic population declines were observed in the sites impacted by wild boars (N = 14), while in other sites spared by wild boars populations remained stable (N = 9). Wild boars are highly fertile and their main predators have been extirpated from Western Europe; yet, recreational hunting kept populations in check during decades. Hunting pressure is currently insufficient to control the rapid expansion of wild boars, demographic outbreaks are increasingly frequent. Wild boars are omnivorous; they can destroy snakes directly and indirectly through the depletion of snake's preys and via the destruction of key microhabitats. Snakes exhibit limited dispersal capacities; they cannot escape local perturbations and thus are highly vulnerable. Because wild boars have a very eclectic diet, are prolific breeders and are able to devastate a range of habitats their negative impact under relaxed hunting pressure applies to a huge variety of organisms, including reptiles. Policies to limit wild boar populations are urgently needed. Recommendations to target reproductive females and piglets should be generalized and applied."

Even though the northern Patagonian population of O. ?avescens is increasing its abundance is still far below its historical numbers. The Ne estimated should be considered the minimum range to be maintained, especially in light of bycatch related to ?shery interactions along the Patagonian coast. We emphasise the importance of estimating Ne for future management plans of the species within different populations. "
544,2312,What limits the Serengeti zebra population?,"The populations of the ecologically dominant ungulates in the Serengeti ecosystem (zebra, wildebeest and buffalo) have shown markedly different trends since the 1960s: the two ruminants both irrupted after the elimination of rinderpest in 1960, while the zebras have remained stable. The ruminants are resource limited (though parts of the buffalo population have been limited by poaching since the 1980s). The zebras' resource acquisition tactics should allow them to outcompete the ruminants, but their greater spatial dispersion makes them more available to predators, and it has been suggested that this population is limited by predation. To investigate the mechanisms involved in the population dynamics of Serengeti zebra, we compared population dynamics among the three species using demographic models based on age-class-specific survival and fecundity. The only major difference between zebra and the two ruminants occurred in the first-year survival. We show that wildebeest have a higher reproductive potential than zebra (younger age at first breeding and shorter generation time). Nevertheless, these differences in reproduction cannot account for the observed differences in the population trends between the zebra and the ruminants. On the other hand, among-species differences in first-year survival are great enough to account for the constancy of zebra population size. We conclude that the very low first-year survival of zebra limits this population. We provide new data on predation in the Serengeti and show that, as in other ecosystems, predation rates on zebras are high, so predation could hold the population in a ""predator pit"". However, lion and hyena feed principally on adult zebras, and further work is required to discover the process involved in the high mortality of foals. "
545,3968,Evolution of small terrestrial mammal species richness on newly formed islands in primary tropical forest of French Guiana: A 6 year study,"The presence of small terrestrial mammals (rodents and marsupials) on islands created by the filling of the Petit Saut dam ' s reservoir in French Guiana was assessed by terrestrial trappings. Thirty three islands (ranging from 0. 1 to 8.5 ha in area) were sampled between 1; and 7 times each, from 1 994 when they were formed until 1 999. Altogether, 84 individuals were trapped, belonging to 8 different species (Proechimys cuvieri, Oryzomys megacephalus, Oryzomys macconnelli, Oecomys auyantepui, Neacomys guianae, Mesomys hispidus, Philander opossum and Didelphis marsupialis). Proechimys cuvieri was by far the dominant species, followed by O. megacephalus. Overall species richness decreased rapidly (from 4 species in 1 994 and 5 in 1 995 to 1 in 1 996 and 1 997), then slightly increased again (3 species in 1 998, 2 in 1 999). Nearly half of the total number of small marnmals captured, ali Proechimys (mainly P. cuvieri but possibly also P.  cayennensis), were captured on an island temporarily connected to a larger one at the end of each dry season. This case apart, the presence of small marnmals on islands was found to be correlated neither with island area nor isolation (from the mainland or the nearest Iarger island). Fruit abundance did not seem to play a major role in the presence of small mammals on islands during the 1 995 and 1 996 dry; seasons, but appeared somewhat associated with it during the 1 996 wet season. More data are needed to check for the importance of this parameter in the Iong-term maintenance of populations. For those islands where severa! trapping sessions were conducted, population; extinction appeared as the most probable scenario to describe the results obtained. ln two cases only, conceming P. cuvieri, one may suspect that recolonization has followed an initial extinction event. On two other islands, the persistence of very small populations of P. cuvieri during the whole study period has been recorded. On one of the latter two islands, the successful colonization of O. megacephalus has also been recorded. At this short-term scale of perception, on! y very small populations of P. cuvieri, and possibly O. megacephalus, seem able to remain on a few islands (in this range of areas), but they may be dependent on regular immigration for their medium- to long-term survival."
546,1637,"The Extraordinary El Niño Event of 1982-83: Effects on Darwin's Finches on Isla Genovesa, Galápagos","The strongest oceanographic warming trend in the E Pacific this century was accompanied by exceptionally heavy and prolonged rains. Genovesa normally receives 100-150 mm of rain in the 1st 2-4 months of a calendar year. In the recent event, rain began falling in November 1982 and continued until July 1983; the total was = or >2408 mm. Plants responded with prodigious growth, and produced enormous crops of seeds. Finches bred up to 8 times, although not with uniformly outstanding success. Environmental constraints were relaxed on 3 reproductive traits: duration of breeding, where birds bred, and number of young birds that bred. Clutch sizes and rates of clutch production were not affected. By the end of the breeding season population densities were exceptionally high, and age structures were dominated by young birds. The profound ecological effects of this climatic extreme in the terrestrial environment were short-lived. In the following 2 yr rains were weak (1984) or non-existent (1985), much of the vegetation died, and both seed supply and finch numbers declined drastically to the low levels recorded in 1978 and 1979. -from Authors"
547,3100,"Changes in shorebird and eider abundance in the Rasmussen Lowlands, NWT","Historical records of population numbers are almost entirely lacking for shorebirds and some; species of waterfowl breeding in the Nearctic. In 1975 and 1976, ground surveys of breeding birds were undertaken; in the Rasmussen Lowlands, Northwest Territories. We carried out similar censuses in the same area; during the summers of 1994 and 1995. Weather conditions and methods were very similar during the two sets; of surveys. For all years, we compared densities in different habitat types, as well as estimates for the entire; region of total numbers of breeding Red Phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicaria), Pectoral Sandpipers, (Calidris melanotos),; White-rumped Sandpipers (C. fuscicollis), Semipalmated Sandpipers (C. pusilla), Black-bellied Plovers; (Pluvialis squatarola), American Golden-Plovers (Pluvialis dominica), Dunlin (C. alpina), Baird's Sandpipers; (C. bairdii), and King Eiders (Somateria spectabilis). We found that breeding populations of Red Phalaropes,; Black-bellied Plovers, American Golden-Plovers, and King Eiders in the 1990s had decreased substantially (76-; 87%) from their numbers in the 1970s. Numbers of other shorebird species did not decrease significantly (17-; 48%). Numbers of Black-bellied Plovers have apparently decreased at staging sites on the east coast of the; United States and Canada. However, for American Golden-Plovers, there is no evidence of a decline on the east; coast or in at least one other area in the eastern Nearctic. No other population information exists for Red; Phalaropes breeding in the eastern Nearctic. Eider numbers appear to be decreasing throughout the Arctic.; Possible reasons for declines are habitat changes in migratory staging sites and southern wintering areas. We; need more consistent monitoring of arctic shorebirds in order to identify species with continual population; declines. Further studies should emphasize Nearctic populations of species showing substantial declines in this; study, examining consistency of decreases throughout the Nearctic, and reasons for such changes."
548,2885,A review of the population status of the Heard Island Cormorant Phalacrocorax nivalis,"The endemic Heard Island Cormorant or Shag Phalacrocorax nivalis has the smallest population of all the; sub-Antarctic cormorants. Counts at breeding localities suggest that the population has wide variation in; production of fledged chicks, ranging from none in some years to over 100 in others. Only one major roost; for non-breeding birds is known. Counts of birds at this roost decreased from the mid to late 1980s. Population; estimates for the whole island also decreased from over 600 birds to about 250 in an eight-month; period in 1987. It is postulated that this was the result of a single event that reduced the population but did; not affect the subsequent reproductive effort, which was the highest recorded. This decline is of particular; concern in view of the species endemicity and small population, and greater efforts in monitoring this; species numbers will be required in the future."
549,172,"Threats to Burdur Lake ecosystem, Turkey and its waterbirds, particularly the white-headed duck Oxyura leucocephala","Burdur Lake, a closed-basin saline lake in south-west Anatolia, Turkey, is internationally important for its wintering waterbirds. It is the most important wintering site in the world for the white-headed duck Oxyura leucocephala, a globally threatened species. It has also held internationally important numbers of 10 other waterbird species. The lake is threatened by the construction of an industrial complex and airport on the northern shore. Falling water levels (from construction of upstream dams), sedimentation (from catchment erosion), organic pollution (from food processing and sewage) and inorganic effluent (from a sulphur mine) represent long-term threats to the lake system. Illegal hunting from the shore has a serious impact upon white-headed ducks, which concentrate close inshore and show little escape response in the presence of hunters. White-headed duck numbers have fluctuated considerably since 1967 with a peak (incomplete) count of 10,927 in February 1991. By January 1995, numbers had declined to 2805. Numbers of black-necked grebe Podiceps nigricollis, white-fronted goose Anser albifrons and tufted duck Aythya fuligula have declined. Numbers of large gulls of the Larus argentatus group which prey upon white-headed duck have increased, possibly due to pollution. For 10 of 16 waterbird species regularly observed at the site, highest numbers were recorded before 1974. Recommendations for the conservation of the lake are presented. "
550,2381,Oskarshamn site investigations: Bird monitoring in Simpevarp 2002–2009,"This report is a summary of the monitoring of breeding birds species in Simpevarp 20022009. The; report summarizes the population development of eight selected listed species (Swedish Red List; and/or the European Unions Birds Directive) in the area. The aim of the report is to evaluate possible; impacts from the now completed site investigations, conducted by SKB, on the breeding bird fauna.; Selected listed species were monitored in the whole regional model area with specially designed methods.; For most species selected for detailed monitoring proper data is now available for seven years.; The general conclusion from the more detailed monitoring of selected listed species is that the site; investigations, associated potentially disturbing activities and increased human presence in the area,; have had very little impact on the breeding birds of the area.; For listed species selected for detailed monitoring, the general stable or positive population development; recorded in earlier years continued in 2009. Six of the eight species (honey buzzard, white-tailed eagle,; wryneck, lesser spotted woodpecker, nightjar and red-backed shrike) show stable or increasing numbers; during the whole study period. Only one species, the osprey, have decreased in local numbers during; the period. On a larger regional scale the ospreys show tendencies of an increase in numbers and the; decrease in Simpevarp is thus regarded as a re-distribution of birds rather than a decrease in population; size. Another species, the eagle owl show tendencies for decreasing numbers around Simpevarp.; Comparing results between 2008 and 2009, five of the eight species remained stable or increased; in numbers to 2009 (white-tailed eagle, osprey, wryneck, lesser spotted woodpecker and red-backed; shrike). The remaining three species (honey buzzard, eagle owl and nightjar) decreased somewhat in; numbers between the last two years, but the decrease was in all cases small and well within what can; be regarded as normal variation."
551,3023,Effects of an Invasive Plant on Population Dynamics in Toads,"When populations decline in response to unfavorable environmental change, the dynamics of their population growth shift. In populations that normally exhibit high levels of variation in recruitment and abundance, as do many amphibians, declines may be difficult to identify from natural fluctuations in abundance. However, the onset of declines may be evident from changes in population growth rate in sufficiently long time series of population data. With data from 23 years of study of a population of Fowler's toad (Anaxyrus [ = Bufo] fowleri) at Long Point, Ontario (1989-2011), we sought to identify such a shift in dynamics. We tested for trends in abundance to detect a change point in population dynamics and then tested among competing population models to identify associated intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The most informative models of population growth included terms for toad abundance and the extent of an invasive marsh plant, the common reed (Phragmites australis), throughout the toads' marshland breeding areas. Our results showed density-dependent growth in the toad population from 1989 through 2002. After 2002, however, we found progressive population decline in the toads associated with the spread of common reeds and consequent loss of toad breeding habitat. This resulted in reduced recruitment and population growth despite the lack of significant loss of adult habitat. Our results underscore the value of using long-term time series to identify shifts in population dynamics coincident with the advent of population decline. "
552,3953,"Distance sampling to determine kaka (Nestor meridionalis septentrionalis) density; within Waipapa Ecological Area, Pureora","Reliable information about population density and trends is essential for making valid inferences regarding; conservation management. The suitability of point counts using distance sampling was examined as a means of monitoring a population of kaka (Nestor meridionalis septentrionalis), a large forest-dwelling parrot, inhabiting the Waipapa Ecological Area in the central North Island of New Zealand. Counts were conducted on 13 occasions between 2000 and 2007. The sampling design was tailored to maximise the detectability of kaka and to minimise violations of the four most important assumptions of distance sampling. Location errors and subsequent distance estimation errors were most likely to bias density estimates despite our attempts to minimise failures of this assumption. Densities estimated from counts conducted in October were similar between 2000 and 2007 (approximately 0.5 kaka ha-1) with no evidence of either a positive or negative trend.; Densities derived from counts in February or March were more erratic and seemed to reflect variation in the frequency and success of the preceding breeding season. Given the frequency of kaka breeding, the pest control regime during the study period, and our attempts to minimise violations of distance sampling assumptions, we are confident that the reported trends in density are realistic. Although distance sampling was found to give reliable density estimates of kaka at Waipapa, this may not be the case at other sites, particularly where kaka density is low, location error is high, forest structure or topography are more complex, or surveys of kaka are made part of more extensive multi-species surveys."
553,2172,"Trawls and cooling-water intakes as estuarine fish sampling tools: Comparisons of catch composition, trends in relative abundance, and length selectivity","Fish populations in estuaries are often monitored with traditional sampling gears such as trawls. Trawling is relatively expensive and may be hindered by environmental conditions such as tides and substrates. Power station cooling-water intake screens have been effectively used as estuarine fish sampling devices for many years, but very few quantitative comparisons of intake fish-catch characteristics with samples from other collection methods have been made. Fish collected at the cooling-water intake of a large power station in the lower Forth estuary, UK, were more similar in assemblage composition to fish caught by nearby pelagic trawling than to fish caught by Agassiz (demersal) trawling, mostly because the intake and pelagic-trawl catches were largely composed of clupeids (Sprattus sprattus and Clupea harengus). The intake catch was typified by pelagic, demersal, and benthic species, however, and was less variable than the catches made by the two trawls. Monthly trends in relative abundance correlated reasonably well between the intake and trawl samples. Fish collected at the intake tended to be significantly smaller than those collected by trawling, which was probably attributable to the intake's smaller mesh size. The study highlighted the utility of a cooling-water intake as an efficient, low-cost fish sampling device, which should be considered as an alternative to trawling as the cost of the latter increases into the future.

554,4400,Fish are not safe from great cormorants in turbid water,"Great cormorant populations have shown near-exponential increase in Western Europe over recent decades, generating wildlife management conflicts across the region. It is essential to detail the foraging strategies of this piscivorous predator to understand the functional mechanisms determining its actual impact upon freshwater fisheries. Great cormorants have been shown to be highly efficient predators, yet their underwater vision is limited in turbid water. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the predatory performance of great cormorants will be lower in turbid than in clear water. We used parallel data sets on water turbidity, great cormorant diet, great cormorant population size, fish biomass and fish-cormorant co-occurrence collected over 3 decades, with a focus on 1997 and 1998, in 2 Macedonian lake systems with contrasting features. In one lake system, water turbidity was lower, fish abundance was also lower, and the local great cormorant population did not increase markedly in size. Local populations of Alburnus belvica, which is the preferred prey of great cormorants in this region, increased over the study period. In the second lake system, water turbidity was higher, fish abundance was also higher, and the local great cormorant population has increased exponentially since the 1980s. Along the highly turbid affluent of this lake, great cormorants foraged en masse at the time of highest fish abundance, and local fish biomass decreased over the study period. Overall, our data strongly suggest that great cormorants remain highly efficient fish predators even in the most turbid water. We propose that they switch from visual to tactile cues to maintain high foraging efficiency when diving in water above a certain turbidity threshold. "
555,4488,The Effects of Forest Clearcut Harvesting and Thinning on Terrestrial Salamanders,"[We studied short-term effects of forest clearcut harvesting and thinning on species presence, abundance, and demographics of terrestrial salamanders in an area intensively managed for forest products in southwestern Washington. We used pitfall traps to sample 4 previously harvested 45-60-year-old forested areas and 4 adjacent areas clearcut 2-5 years previously. In a separate experiment, we conducted surveys before and after thinning on 4 control and 4 treatment sites. Western red-backed salamanders (Plethodon vehiculum), ensatinas (Ensatina eschscholtzii), northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile), rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa), and Dunn's salamanders (Plethodon dunni) were captured in both forested and clearcut areas. Columbia torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton kezeri) and Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) were captured only in forested areas. Capture rates of red-backed salamanders were greater in forested than clearcut areas in fall 1994 and 1995). The size-class distribution of red-backed salamanders was skewed toward the smaller size classes in clearcut areas in fall 1994 but not fall 1995. Ensatina showed no difference in capture rate or size-class distribution between forested and clearcut areas in fall 1994, but showed a reduced rate of capture in clearcut areas relative to forested areas in fall 1995. Gravid females were present in both clearcut and forested areas for western red-backed salamanders and ensatinas. Although species presence was unaffected by thinning, western red-backed salamander capture rates on treatment sites were reduced after thinning. Population responses of salamander species to forest management are variable, with some species declining in abundance after clearcutting and thinning.]"
556,2148,"Abundance of selected fish species in relation to temperature and salinity patterns in the Sagavanirktok Delta, Alaska, following construction of the Endicott Causeway","Hydrography data from 1985 to 1993 in the vicinity of the Endicott Causeway near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, were analyzed to determine if the trend in yearly post-causeway construction temperature and salinity was toward colder and more saline conditions. No significant (p ≤ 0.05) relationship was found for temperature; however, salinity levels significantly decreased with time following construction. Intra-year variations in hydrographic conditions appeared to be due to coast-wide meteorological and oceanographic events rather than cause-way-induced. We analyzed abundance indices, as log(e) transformed catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), of four marine species (arctic cod, Boreogadus saida; fourhorn sculpin, Myoxocephalus quadricornis; arctic flounder, Pleuronectes glacialis; saffron cod, Eleginus gracilis); two freshwater species (round whitefish, Prosopium cylindraceum; arctic grayling, Thymallus arcticus); and the anadromous rainbow smelt, Osmerus mordax, to determine whether there were increases in the abundances of marine species and declines in anadromous and freshwater species. We developed the 'best-fit' regression models, based on the criterion of maximized regression F-ratio (i.e., minimized regression p-values), using year, temperature, salinity, and all possible interactions. Results suggested that all species exhibited changes in abundance levels over the period of record. In particular, arctic flounder and rainbow smelt both showed sharp increases in abundance five years after construction. For all species, the observed changes in abundance levels appeared to be due to naturally occurring events in the species' life histories or changes in coast-wide meteorological conditions rather than to causeway-induced alterations in local hydrographic conditions."
557,3447,"Diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of bats in the oil sands regions of Northeastern Alberta","Little is known about the diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of bats in northeastern Alberta, Canada. Between 1999 and 2007, we conducted summer bat surveys in the Athabasca and Cold Lake oil sands regions of northeastern Alberta, in response to increased industrial development and a need for greater understanding of species occurrences. We used mist nets (242 sites over 157 nights) and acoustic monitoring (920 sites over 126 nights) to determine the diversity and distribution of bats in the region. We captured 577 bats, representing 5 species, including: 260 Northern Myotis (Myotis septentrionalis); 193 Little Brown Myotis (M. lucifugus); 101 Silver-haired Bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans); 12 Hoary Bats (Lasiurus cinereus); and 11 Eastern Red Bats (L. borealis). Data from AnabatTM echolocation detectors indicated the  highest activity for unclassified Myotis, Little Brown Myotis, Big Brown Bats (Eptesicus fuscus)/Silver-haired Bats, and Northern Myotis. Results suggest that the Northern Myotis may be more common in northeastern Alberta than previously thought. Based on the combined capture and echolocation data, Eastern Red Bats and Hoary Bats may be more common, or have increased ranges, than previously considered. Although expected to be relatively common, our failure to capture Big Brown Bats suggests that this species may be absent from the study area. Captures of adult males for all 3 migratory bat species (Eastern Red Bats, Hoary Bats, and Silver-haired Bats) represent the most northerly records in western Canada of adult males. This paper demonstrates the value in combining short-term, localized survey data such that more regional trends in the diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of bats can be better understood."
558,3795,"Demography of the Giant Otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) in Manu National Park, South-Eastern Peru: Implications for Conservation","The giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) is an endangered semi-aquatic carnivore of South America. We present findings on the demography of a population inhabiting the floodplain of Manu National Park, south-eastern Peru, arising from 14 annual dry season censuses over a 16 year period. The breeding system of territorial groups, including only a single breeding female with non-reproductive adult 'helpers', resulted in a low intrinsic rate of increase (0.03) and a slow recovery from decades of hunting for the pelt trade. This is explained by a combination of factors: (1) physiological traits such as late age at first reproduction and long generation time, (2) a high degree of reproductive skew, (3) small litters produced only once a year, and (4) a 50% mortality between den emergence and age of dispersal, as well as high mortality amongst dispersers (especially males). Female and male giant otters show similar traits with respect to average reproductive life-spans (female 5.4 yrs., male 5.2 yrs.) and average cub productivity (female 6.9, male 6.7 cubs per lifetime); the longest reproductive life spans were 11 and 13 years respectively. Individual reproductive success varied substantially and depended mainly on the duration of dominance tenure in the territory. When breeding females died, the reproductive position in the group was usually occupied by sisters or daughters (n = 11), with immigrant male partners. Male philopatry was not observed. The vulnerability of the Manu giant otter population to anthropogenic disturbance emphasises the importance of effective protection of core lake habitats in particular. Riverine forests are the most endangered ecosystem in the Department of Madre de Dios due to the concentration of gold mining, logging and agricultural activities in floodplains, highlighting the need for a giant otter habitat conservation corridor along the Madre de Dios River."
559,4411,"Estimating long-term trends in abundance and survival for nesting flatback turtles in Kakadu National Park, Australia","Flatback turtles Natator depressus are endemic to Australia and Papua New Guinea's tropical oceans and, although the species has an extensive distribution around northern Australia, there are few published long-term abundance trends of nesting populations. We conducted a longterm capture-mark-recapture program on nesting flatback turtles on Field Island in Kakadu National Park, a World Heritage Area that is jointly managed by Aboriginal landowners and the Australian Government, from 2002 to 2013 for between 12 and 20 monitoring days per year. We used a Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model that accounted for transience and recapture heterogeneity to estimate apparent survival and recapture probability, and estimated abundance using a Horvitz-Thompson type estimator. A total of 257 flatback turtles attempted nesting during that period, averaging 3.68 ± 0.28 (mean ± SE) nesting attempts per night of monitoring. Annual apparent survival of nesting flatback turtles was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.94 to 0.98) and increased relative to body size. Recapture probability averaged 0.38 (95% CI = 0.34 to 0.42) and was influenced by inter-annual climatic variability. The size of the Field Island nesting flatback turtle population ranged from 97 (95% CI = 87 to 106) to 183 (95% CI = 165 to 200) and there was a non-significant trend over 12 yr of monitoring. Understanding long-term population trends of nesting marine turtles is fundamental for management and recovery of these at-risk species."
560,987,Evaluating the severity of the population bottleneck mauritius kestrel Falco punctatus from ringing records using MCMC estimation,"1. The Mauritius kestrel Falco punctatus (Temminck 1823) has recovered from very low numbers. In order to evaluate the severity of the population bottleneck that it experienced, we have developed a method for estimating the productivity of the nests that escaped detection. This method uses ringing records for MCMC estimation of parameters describing the recruitment of adults to the breeding population and the growth in productivity of undiscovered nests. 2. Comparison of the estimates for the two restored populations (eastern and western) showed a far lower proportion of undiscovered nests in the former, as predicted because of widespread use of nestboxes. This served to verify the method of estimation. The estimates show a steady increase in population size, in contrast with field estimates indicating a recent reduction in growth. 3. The results suggest that the alarmingly low estimates of population size in 1974 (two breeding pairs) were accurate, and that few undiscovered nests existed during the bottleneck. 4. The recovery of the population seems to have been initiated by the intensive conservation effort. The most rapid period of population growth coincides with the reintroduction programme. The results imply that the eastern population is much more reliant on intensive management for its future growth."
561,3916,Population dynamics of brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Spruce Creek Pennsylvania: A quarter-century perspective,"1. We examined the relationship between density-independent and density-dependent; factors on the demography of a dense, relatively unexploited population of; brown trout in Spruce Creek Pennsylvania between 1985 and 2011.; 2. Individual PCAs of flow and temperature data elucidated groups of years with; multiple high flow versus multiple low flow characteristics and high versus low; temperature years, although subtler patterns of variation also were observed.; 3. Density and biomass displayed similar temporal patterns, ranging from 710 to; 1,803 trout/ha and 76263 kg/ha. We detected a significantly negative linear; stock-recruitment relationship (R2 = .39) and there was no evidence that flow or; water temperature affected recruitment.; 4. Both annual survival and the per-capita rate of increase (r) for the population; varied over the study, and density-dependent mechanisms possessed the greatest; explanatory power for annual survival data. Temporal trends in population r; suggested it displayed a bounded equilibrium with increases observed in; 12 years and decreases detected in 13 years.; 5. Model selection analysis of per-capita rate of increase data for age 1, and adults; (N = eight interpretable models) indicated that both density-dependent (five of; eight) and negative density-independent processes (five of eight, i.e. high flows; or temperatures), affected r. Recruitment limitation also was identified in three; of eight models. Variation in the per-capita rate of increase for the population; was most strongly affected by positive density independence in the form of; increasing springsummer temperatures and recruitment limitation.; 6. Model selection analyses describing annual variation in both mean length and; mass data yielded similar results, although maximum wi values were low ranging; from 0.09 to 0.23 (length) and 0.13 to 0.22 (mass). Density-dependence was; included in 15 of 15 interpretable models for length and all ten interpretable; models for mass. Similarly, positive density-independent effects in the form of; increasing autumnwinter flow were present in seven of 15 interpretable models; for length and five of ten interpretable models for mass. Negative density independent; effects also were observed in the form of high springsummer flows or; temperatures (N = 4), or high autumnwinter temperatures (N = 1).; 7. Our analyses of the factors affecting population regulation in an introduced population; of brown trout demonstrate that density-dependent forces affected; every important demographic characteristic (recruitment, survivorship, the rate of increase, and size) within this population. However, density-independent forces; in the form of seasonal variations in flow and temperature also helped explain; annual variation in the per-capita rate of increase, and mean length and mass; data. Consequently, population regulation within this population is driven by a; complex of biotic and environmental factors, although it seems clear that density-; dependent factors play a dominant role."
562,1871,"Status and trends of loon populations summering in Alaska, 1971-1993","Loons (Gavia spp.) were counted during the Alaska-Yukon Waterfowl Breeding Population Survey from 1971 to 1993 and the Arctic Coastal Plain Waterbird Breeding Population Survey from 1986 to 1993. Population indices for Alaska (not corrected for visibility bias) are presented by species for boreal forest, tundra, and both habitats combined. Minimum mean population estimates (1977-1993) with 95% confidence intervals were 15,360 (±2,235) Red-throated Loons (G. stellata), 69,498 (±5,596) Pacific Loons (G. pacifica), 8,886 (±843) Common Loons (G. immer) and 2,636 (±614) Yellow- billed Loons (G. adamsii). Populations of Pacific, Common and Yellow-billed Loons did not change significantly between 1977 and 1993, whereas Red- throated Loons declined by 53% to a 1993 level of 9,843 (±2,447) (r2 = 0.65, P < 0.001). Factors affecting results from aerial surveys are discussed."
563,1828,"Cyclic dynamics of sympatric lemming populations on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada","We characterized the fluctuations (amplitude, periodicity) of two sympatric species, the brown lemming (Lemmus sibiricus (Kerr, 179 2)) and the northern collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus (Traill, 1823)), in a High Arctic area. Our objective was to determine if these populations were cyclic, and if fluctuations in numbers were synchronized between the two species temporally and spatially. An annual index of lemming abundance was obtained using snap-traps at two sites 30 km apart on Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada) over 13 years (1993-2005) and 9 years (1997-2005), respectively. The time series were analyzed by spectral analyses and autoregressive modelling. At the site with the longest record, brown lemming showed regular population fluctuations of large amplitude (>40-fold), but collared lemming fluctuations were of much smaller amplitude (4-fold). At the other site, the collared lemming population was higher than at the main site, but brown lemmings were still most abundant in the peak year. Models with a second-order function obtained from a spectral analysis were highly correlated with the observed abundance index in both species at the site with the longest time series, and provide evidence of cyclic dynamic. The periods of the cycles were estimated at 3.69 ± 0.04 (SE) years for brown lemmings and 3.92 ± 0.24 (SE) years for collared lemmings, but the amplitude of the cycle was weak in the latter species. Fluctuations in abundance at the same site were relatively well synchronized between the two species, but the evidence for synchrony between sites was equivocal. "
564,2864,Persistence of fish populations in the upper Parana´ River: effects of water regulation by dams,"  Riverfloodplain systems present intense temporal variations in; physical, chemical and biological factors. These variations are closely; related to alterations in water levels, which have been attributed to the; flood pulse. As several species are strictly related to the flood pulse to fulfil; their life cycle, the pulse may be seen as a dispersal mechanism of species; onto a floodplain. In this study, we determine how dam construction; influenced the persistence of Prochilodus lineatus population, a large; migratory fish species from the upper Parana´ River floodplain. Data used; were collected in two distinct periods, from April 1992 to March 1993 and; from January 1999 to December 2001. Fish were collected using seining; nets in six (monthly in the first period) and seven (quarterly in the second; period) isolated lagoons. The fraction of occupied lagoons was high in the; first period (higher than 0.65), when flood was intense. However, in the; second period, when the flood pulse did not happen or was short, the; fraction of occupied lagoons sharply decreased over time (from 0.85 to; 0.22). For the first period, no model fitted to data, but for the second; period, a negative linear model (named drought-dependent model); presented good fit (r2 ¼ 0.97). Therefore, it is possible to infer that long; and intense flood pulses are important to maintain the persistence of; P. lineatus populations in the floodplain. The artificial control of water; levels prompted by dams disrupts this dynamic, reducing persistence to; critical levels."
565,1815,Arctic charr in Lake Myvatn: The centennial catch record in the light of recent stock estimates,"In Lake Myvatn, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is economically the most important fish species. It is fast growing fish and its size at maturity is 3550 cm at the age of 4 to 5 years. Catch statistics that are available for the whole 20th century show considerable long-term variation with the highest catch in the 1920s. The catches after 1970 are about 40% lower than the average from 19301969 and the annual catches for the last decade are the lowest. Stock size during the winter fishing season fluctuated considerably between years, with average annual fishing mortality of 83.9%. The Arctic charr population has been monitored annually since 1986, using standard series of gill nets of different mesh sizes. In 1988 one to three-year-old fish were heavily reduced in numbers during the summer months. There are indications of a similar event in 1997. In both years the charr changed its main diet from Cladocera and chironomid midges to three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus and snails. At the same time its condition deteriorated. The catch in the monitoring fishery in Lake Myvatn correlates with the stock size in the beginning of the following winter fishing season deduced from Leslie's method and can give prospects for the fishery in the successive fishing season. An index of abundance of young charr also correlates with the number of chironomids and cladocerans and also with ducklings that feed on the same food as the charr. Large fluctuations in the Arctic charr population in Lake Myvatn seem to be related to changes in the main food species. The catch records available from Lake Myvatn can to a large extent be used as a measure of changes of the Arctic charr population in the lake for the past century."
566,4104,Amphibian diversity increases in an heterogeneous agricultural landscape,"As a group amphibians are the vertebrates most affected by anthropic activity, particularly by agriculture. The rapid advance of the agricultural frontier makes it important to identify the role of agroecosystems as habitat supply for amphibians. We analyzed the differences in amphibian assemblages and populations between habitats with different plant covers and different degrees of human intervention in northwestern Argentina. For three years we conducted 114 high frequency trap samplings to quantify abundance, specific composition and species richness of amphibian assemblages in three habitat types (lemon and sugarcane crops and secondary forest) of a piedmont agroecosystem of Tucumán province. Crops hosted more species and individuals than secondary forests, but the specific composition of forest was different from that of crops suggesting that they could be complementary. Although the assemblage abundance of every observation responded to climate, the strong effect of sampling year was not related to climatic factors suggesting that there might be long term fluctuations that were not analyzed. We also found that responses to agricultural practices were species specific, so no generalizations about these practices should be done. Our study shows that cultivated areas are not hostile environments for amphibians since they can lodge huge amphibian populations and that the occurrence of disturbances associated to agricultural practices is not necessarily reflected in a decrease in the abundance and richness of amphibians in the short term. However, our results also show that forested lands are necessary to lodge some specialist species which are very rare in the croplands. This suggests that environmental heterogeneity generated by the combination of natural and cultivated patches can increase biodiversity at landscape scale because this allows the coexistence of species related to either kind of environment."
567,3655,"Population Dynamics of the Critically Endangered Golden Lancehead Pitviper, <italic>Bothrops insularis</italic>: Stability or Decline?","<p>Little is known about vital rates of snakes generally because of the difficulty in collecting data. Here we used a robust design mark-recapture model to estimate survival, behavioral effects on capture probability, temporary emigration, abundance and test the hypothesis of population decline in the golden lancehead pitviper, <italic>Bothrops insularis</italic>, an endemic and critically endangered species from southeastern Brazil. We collected data at irregular intervals over ten occasions from 2002 to 2010. Survival was slightly higher in the wet season than in the dry season. Temporal emigration was high, indicating the importance of accounting for this parameter both in the sampling design and modeling. No behavioral effects were detected on capture probability. We detected an average annual population decrease  during the study period, but estimates included high uncertainty, and caution in interpretation is needed. We discuss the potential effects of the illegal removal of individuals and the implications of the vital rates obtained for the future persistence and conservation of this endemic, endangered species.</p>"
568,2594,Population Changes and Demography of the Northern Rockhopper Penguin on Amsterdam and Saint Paul Islands,"We investigated changes in population size and demography of the Northern Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome moseleyi) between 1971 and 1995 on Amsterdam and Saint Paul islands. During an intensive survey between 1993 and 1995, breeding success was similar to that reported from other sites, although the first egg (A-egg) loss rate was lower on Amsterdam Island than at other localities. The mean age of first return to the breeding site and of first reproduction were respectively X? = 4.2 ± SD of 2.1 years and X? = 4.7 ± SD of 1.7 years. The adult survival rate, calculated between 1988 and 1993, was significantly lower one year after banding [X? = 72.2 ± SD of 1.6%] than in subsequent years [X? = 84.0 ± SD of 1.1%] due to the effect of banding. Immature survival rate was estimated at 39% during the first year after banding. Two birds banded as chicks have been found in Australia, suggesting that immatures winter off Southern Australia. The population on Amsterdam Island decreased at a rate of 2.7% per year between 1971 and 1993. Using the demographic parameters measured, we calculated a modelled rate of increase of 0.940 between 1988 and 1993, a value close to the observed rate of 0.943. Between 1982 to 1993, mean sea surface temperature near Amsterdam and Saint Paul islands decreased significantly, and this change was significantly related to the decline of Amsterdam Island population during the same period. Mean sea surface temperature decline could affect the Rockhopper Penguin population through changes of distribution and abundance of prey. Other factors such as the large increase of the Sub-Antarctic Fur Seal population at Amsterdam Island between 1971 and 1993 could have reduced the penguin population. Between 1971 and 1993, the Saint Paul population of penguins increased by 5.5% per year, but this is not significantly related to the mean sea surface temperature decrease. This small Rockhopper Penguin population may still be recovering to its level before exploitation in the 1930s."
569,1765,Conservation and conflict between endangered desert fishes,"Conservation of naturally sympatric endangered species requires unique considerations. While impacts of invasive species garner much attention, interactions between endangered species must also be managed. The endangered Leon Springs pupfish, Cyprinodon bovinus, has suffered a population decline due to decreasing natural habitat. As breeding habitat is lost, C. bovinus is also adversely affected by the sympatric, endangered Pecos gambusia, Gambusia nobilis. Here, we document interactions between these species, finding significantly more G. nobilis accumulated at pupfish spawning events than randomly distributed on breeding grounds in the absence of spawning. As a known egg predator, our results suggest that G. nobilis presence at spawnings may further decrease pupfish numbers while also altering the evolutionary dynamics of C. bovinus breeding tactics. Habitat restoration may decrease Gambusia concentrations or influence C. bovinus breeding behaviour and increase the number of territorial males resulting in viable population sizes for both critically endangered fishes.

570,3481,"Population size and migratory connectivity of humpback whales wintering in Las Perlas Archipelago, Panama","From 2003 to 2009, we surveyed Las Perlas Archipelago off the Pacific coast of Panama 53 times between the months of August and October to estimate abundance of humpback whales and to test for a migratory connection with populations from the southern hemisphere. We identified 295 individuals using photo-identification of dorsal fins, including 58 calves, and the population estimate for a single season was 100-300 solitary adults plus 25-50 mothers with calves; the estimated population of animals across all seasons using a mark and recapture model was over 1,000. Eight of the 139 fluke identifications were matched to whales in photograph catalogues from the Antarctic Peninsula and a ninth was matched to a whale sighted in Chilean waters; four of these nine individuals have also been sighted in Colombia. We conclude that Panama (Las Perlas Archipelago in particular) is an important calving area for humpback whales in the Southern Hemisphere. These data should provide a foundation for monitoring of population change and to increase awareness in Panama about the need to manage vessel traffic and tourism related to the whales at Las Perlas."
571,2369,Influence of farming activities in the Iberian Peninsula on the winter habitat use of common crane (Grus grus) in areas of its traditional migratory routes,"Farming activities can in¯uence bird habitat and wintering patterns. Changes in the wintering habitat use of common crane; (Grus grus) were related to changes in land use on this species' traditional migration route in the Western Palaearctics. The; study was conducted in the Orellana area (Extremadura, SW Spain), the most important wintering area on this route, where the; continued availability of natural food resources (acorns, bulbs, invertebrates) represents a more balanced diet than agricultural; resources alone. The presence of crops such as corn (Zea mays L.) is, however, not a critical factor in the area, since the two; types of resources, natural and agricultural, are available in the same period of time. The increase in area dedicated to irrigated; crops, especially rice (Oriza sp.), affected the growth in the numbers of wintering cranes in the Orellana area. In the past the; peak wintering period was in December and was positively correlated to acorn production, whereas the peak period is now in; January±February, coinciding with the use of rice-®eld stubble as feeding places. Dehesas (Mediteranean scrub), cultivated or; not, may replace rice-®eld stubble as feeding places. The existence of intensive farming activity in combination with; traditional land-uses is suggested to be the cause of these changes."
572,3718,Evaluating the relationship between mean catch per unit effort and abundance for littoral cyprinids in small boreal shield lakes.,"Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is commonly used as a relative measure of littoral fish abundance; however, few studies have examined this relationship for boreal shield lakes. We used non-linear regression to generate relationships between mark-recapture abundance estimates and mean CPUE derived from 7 years of standardized fishing using baited minnow traps for two common cyprinid species; pearl dace (Margariscus margarita) and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), in littoral areas of two small boreal lakes. We produced significant, positive CPUE-abundance relationships for pearl dace and fathead minnows. Pearl dace were less variable in daily CPUE during the course of the study, suggesting they may require less sampling effort than fathead minnows to precisely estimate their population size. Density estimates derived from our estimates of abundance were consistent with those from similar boreal shield lakes, providing confidence in our method to estimate abundance. Finally, we developed relationships to estimate population size from long-term monitoring data collected on these same cyprinid species using two types of small mesh trap nets. Non-linear relationships were developed between mean trap net CPUE and abundance estimates derived from minnow traps for fathead minnows, but not pearl dace. These relationships should permit population estimates from mean CPUE data collected using similar capture methods in similar lakes. "
573,1618,Response of the riverine fish community to the construction and operation of a diversion hydropower plant in central Chile,"1. Chilean rivers have a large potential for hydropower development, and they also contain a unique native fish fauna with a high level of endemism. Several diversion hydropower plants have recently been constructed in Chile; however, the response of fish communities to these new hydropower plant designs is not well known. 2. Responses of native and non-native fish to the construction and operation of a new hydropower plant that diverts water from two rivers were quantified. The Laja River is highly regulated and manipulated with three older (40 yr) dam-based hydropower plants and irrigation diversions located upstream from the new facility. In contrast, the Rucúe River has no other hydropower facilities and is comparatively undisturbed. 3. Prior to construction, the Laja River had a fish community with lower species richness compared with the Rucúe River. The fish community structure in the Laja River was dramatically altered after the new hydropower facility began operation. On the other hand, in the Rucúe River, even though abundance of fish declined, there was less of a change in the total fish community structure. The fish community in the Rucúe River exhibited greater resistance to change compared with the Laja River. 4. The species most affected were the introduced salmonids and an endangered native species Percilia irwini. 5. Although diversion hydropower designs may have less impact than traditional dam-based hydropower facilities, results of this study indicate that diversion hydropower structures can cause large changes in the fish community.

574,4363,,"Spatio-temporal dynamics of wintering Common Cranes Grus grus in Algeria: a ten year survey. A ten year survey of wintering Common Cranes was carried out in the high plateaus of Algeria (Oran, M'sila, Sétif and Oum El-Bouaghi). The distribution and abundance showed an obvious spatio-temporal variability. The trend in numbers of this species showed a stability in all sites (except in Oum El-Bouaghi where the abundance trend has accused a significant decrease). This should be the result of high human disturbance and, to a lesser extent, to higher winter temperatures particularly at Oum El-Bouaghi. Moreover, the decreasing winter numbers in Algeria coincided with a marked increase in numbers in winter in Europe (Spain and France). Common winter census in North Africa and in Europe are necessary to have a better knowledge of the species' population trend."
575,3180,Estimating Numbers of Black Brant Using Sequential Spring-Staging Sites,"Estimating total number of birds using a particular staging site during migration is challenging because counts alone do not; account for turnover in the local population. Robust statistical methods are needed to more fully assess the conservation value of such sites. We; used the multi-strata model in Program MARK to estimate time-dependent transition probabilities between sequential staging sites to estimate; lengths of stay for spring-staging Pacific black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) on the Fraser River delta and Parksville-Qualicum areas in the; Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada. Using resightings of marked individuals in combination with ground counts, we estimated the; total number of brant, with associated uncertainties, staging at these sites during the spring migrations of 1999 and 2000. We estimated; between 28,927 and 33,181 individual brant transited the Fraser River delta and Parksville-Qualicum sites in 1999 and between 21,621 and; 25,405 individuals in 2000. These totals correspond to approximately 1826% of the entire Pacific Flyway brant population, suggesting the; need for continued conservation and management efforts at these sites. Given the importance of staging sites to migratory populations, we; believe this method could be applied to other species and locations."
576,2720,Habitat selection and population trends in terrestrial bird species of Robinson Crusoe Island: habitat generalists versus forest specialists,"Habitat loss and degradation on oceanic islands are key processes leading to population decline of endemic birds and facilitating the establishment of invasive bird species. In this study, carried out in the Robinson Crusoe Island, we assessed density and habitat selection of terrestrial bird species, including juan fernandez firecrown and juan fernandez tit-tyrant, two endemics, as well as green-backed firecrown and austral thrush, which apparently originate from the mainland. Results show that perturbed habitats contained a low density of the endemic species whereas the mainland species were significantly more abundant in perturbed scrub habitats. Bird species show different habitat selection patterns, with endemics selecting for native forest and mainland species selecting for perturbed habitats, or using them at random. Bird species experienced temporal trends in their overall population sizes, with the endemic tit-tyrant suffering a significant decline in its population size of about 63% between 1994 and 2009. Only mainland species exhibited temporal changes in habitat use, significantly reducing their densities in the preferred scrub habitats, possibly as a response to decreased habitat quality. Thrushes apparently were able to compensate the population decrease in one non native habitat type by using native forests, a habitat giving them the opportunity of preying on nests of endemic species. We conclude that endemic bird species behave as specialists whereas the mainland species must be treated as invasive generalists on Robinson Crusoe Island. "
577,3068,The effects of fire and mechanical habitat destruction on survival of the tortoise Testudo hermanni in northern Greece,"The impact of fire and mechanical habitat destruction on a population of the tortoise Testudo hermanni in northern Greece varied with vegetation type and season. A major fire in summer 1980 caused low (<5%) mortality of sexable tortoises (>10 cm) in coastal heath, highest (about 50%) mortality in grassland, and intermediate levels in dry heath. Mechanical habitat destruction caused about 50% mortality in affected areas. Mortality of juveniles was greater than that of sexable animals. Overall, the 1980 catastrophe was more damaging than previously thought, causing a 64% decrease in the total size of the Alyki main heath population. A localized summer fire in 1986 caused a similar level and pattern of mortality to that of 1980, but a spring fire in 1988 had little effect on the tortoise population. A fire and mechanical habitat destruction in winter 1989/90 caused only a 14% decrease in population; size; mortality was again concentrated in grassland areas, but affected juveniles and sexable animals equally. Variation of mortality with season suggests that any burning needed for habitat management at tortoise sites should occur in winter or early spring. Juveniles were undersampled by 3±4 times compared to sexable animals; their number increased greatly by 1990, reaching the same proportion as in the original population. There was, however, no recovery in the number of sexable tortoises in the decade after the 1980 catastrophe."
578,3069,Implications of high intrinsic growth rate of a tortoise population for conservation,"Demographic analyses suggest that chelonians will have a low ability to withstand harvesting, although most have been based on stationary or declining populations. In contrast to this prediction, a population of Testudo graeca grew at the instantaneous rate r = 0.137 from 19801990, with a doubling time of 5 years. r was similar in both adult and 10 cm animals, showing that this high rate was not due to changes in population structure, and may thus be taken as an intrinsic rate of increase (rm). rm was higher than that of most large mammals, and suggests that sustainable harvesting would be a viable conservation strategy for chelonians if tightly regulated. Ranching or farming operations for chelonians would be even more likely to succeed, given their high fecundity. A resumption of trade in Mediterranean tortoises is, however, unlikely to be economically sustainable."
579,4335,"Changes in the Alyki Kitrous wetland in northern Greece: 1990–1999, and future prospects","The Alyki wetland in northern Greece is a site of notable herpetological and ornithological importance. A large population of the tortoise Testudo hermanni began to recover slowly (r = 0.016) between 1990 and 1999, following catastrophic habitat destruction in 1980 and slow decline from 1980-1990. Heathland vegetation showed signs of desiccation, probably due to increased drainage by the salt works, including deterioration of Crataegus, Ruscus and Asphodelus, and loss of formerly important food plants of tortoises. Activity and body mass condition of tortoises were reduced in summer in grassy heath habitats. Predation of artificial (chicken egg) tortoise nests increased, and the relative frequency of juveniles (about 1% of samples) was lower than after severe habitat destruction or pesticide damage. These changes were attributed to an increasing population of badgers, Meles meles. Population levels of waders were lower in 1998/1999 than in 1988/1989, especially avocets (Recurvirostra avosetta) for which the site was internationally important. Breeding populations of most waders and larids also declined. Mediterranean gulls, for which Alyki was formerly the most important breeding area outside Russia, did not nest from 1990 to 1998, and nests were unsuccessful in 1999. Changes in breeding populations were due to falling lagoon levels, exposure to predators and vegetation encroachment on islet breeding sites. Midwinter waterfowl populations remained high or increased, however, as alternative feeding areas were available in the lagoon. Preservation of the habitats against development of the salt works and increasing desiccation are necessary to maintain the long-term conservation value of the Alyki site."
580,2015,Rapid recovery of an island population of the threatened South Island Saddleback Philesturnus c. carunculatus after a pathogen outbreak,"The small size of many island populations of endangered birds, together with their high density, low genetic diversity and naivety to introduced pathogens, may render them vulnerable to disease epidemics. Such an outbreak occurred in an isolated population of threatened South Island Saddleback Philesturnus c. carunculatus on Motuara Island, New Zealand. In 2002, the population dropped from ~130 birds to ~60 birds, apparently from an outbreak of systemic coccidiosis. However, within three years the population had recovered to > 130 individuals. This appears to be the carrying capacity of the island as areas left vacant after the crash were re-occupied by the end of the third year. Reproductive success of saddlebacks was similar across the three years following the crash and there were no significant differences in clutch size, nesting success or fledgling mass as the population increased. In contrast, feather mite loads increased and leucocyte counts changed significantly in both adult and nestling saddlebacks as the population recovered, suggesting higher population densities may reduce immunocompetence. Although reproductive success did not appear directly affected by population size, our observations indicate increased levels of stress at high densities could render saddlebacks susceptible to recurring disease outbreaks. "
581,3454,Resilience to large-scale disturbance in coral and fish assemblages on the Great Barrier Reef,"Recognition of the complex spatial and temporal variability of abundance and diversity found in many populations has led to a greater focus on the roles of heterogeneity, stochasticity, and disturbance in the structure and persistence of communities. This focus is directly relevant to coral reef communities that are characterized by very high species diversity in a spatially heterogeneous environment, display stochastic variability in community structure at small spatial and temporal scales, and are subject to major disturbances. We monitored coral and fish assemblages over 14 years on fixed sites spread over 80 km of the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, and found evidence of large-scale resilience and predictable recovery of these assemblages. Sometime between November 1987 and October 1989, live coral cover on the shallow northeast flanks of some reefs in the southern GBR decreased from >80% to <10%, probably as a result of storm damage. We compared the fish and benthic communities present in these areas prior to the disturbance (1983-1984) with those present in 1992 and the subsequent changes through to 1998. Hard coral cover increased slowly from 1992 to 1994, then accelerated to be indistinguishable from pre-impact levels by 1998. The response of the coral assemblages was largely due to the predominance of tabulate Acropora species and their characteristics of rapid growth and competitive dominance. Patterns of species richness of the fish families Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Scaridae, and Pomacentridae mirrored that of hard coral, except the Pomacentridae had not recovered to pre-impact levels by 1998. Of the 26 fish species analyzed for changes in abundance, 88% decreased after the disturbance, then subsequently increased, with all but two recovering to pre-impact levels by 1998. Although processes such as settlement and immigration are ultimately responsible for replenishment of local populations, our data suggested that habitat plays a strong role in modifying fish assemblages. Thus, both coral and fish assemblages demonstrated resilience to large-scale natural disturbance and predictability in the structure of the assemblages, with most taxa approaching the asymptote of abundance and species richness that existed prior to the disturbance."
582,591,Fifty-year trends in a Box Turtle Population in Maryland.,"A survey conducted in 1995 investigated long term declines reported in a population of box turtles Terrapene carolina monitored each decade since 1945 in bottomland hardwood forest at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Maryland. Methods duplicated past surveys in most respects, but were supplemented by radiotelemetry and a survey of dominant vegetation. Seventy different turtles were found on the 11.8 ha study area, a decline of >75% since peak populations were recorded in 1955. Searchers were less efficient in 1995 than in 1945-1975 for a variety of possible reasons. Among turtles recorded, approximately equal numbers persisted from each of the past five decades, with some individuals surviving >70 years. A sex ratio strongly favoring males was first recorded in 1975 and continued in 1995, but juveniles and subadults were found in greater proportion in 1995 than in any other survey. Six of nine radio-marked turtles left the bottomland study area and migrated to the adjoining bluffs to hibernate, suggesting more extensive movements and perhaps less stable home ranges than formerly thought. Age structure of trees indicated a gradual change to more shade-tolerant species. Examination of rates of change from survey data suggested that major losses probably resulted from changes in hydrology that exacerbated flooding in 1972, with recovery only beginning in 1995 and perhaps limited both by repeated flood events and successional changes in the forest. Slow recovery from losses may indicate that populations of this species would respond poorly to exploitation."
583,1458,"The beaver’s reconquest of Eurasia: status, population development and management of a conservation success.","Overhunting reduced Eurasian Beaver (Castor fiber) populations to c. 1200 animals, in eight isolated populations, around the end of the 19th century. Protection, natural spread and reintroductions led to a powerful recovery in both range and populations during the 20th century, which continues at a rapid pace. The minimum population estimate is 593 000. There are also c. 12 500 North American Beaver (C. canadensis) established in Finland and Russian Karelia: however, other populations of C. canadensis introduced in Austria, Poland and France appear to be extinct. Castor fiber is now established throughout Europe with the exception of the British Isles, Iberia, Italy and the southern Balkans; reintroductions are continuing. Considerable further expansion in range and population, especially in western Europe and the lower Danube basin, can be expected. If current trends continue, C. fiber will, within a few decades, be a fairly common mammal in much of Europe. Following initial recolonization, populations typically show a pattern of rapid range extension within a watershed, followed only later by rapid population growth, and a barrier effect of watershed divides, which can be strongly isolating where physical or habitat barriers (such as mountains or intensive farmland) intrude between watersheds. Management of beaver distribution should therefore operate at the watershed scale, except where large human-made dams form significant barriers to spread. The period of rapid population increase, if unchecked, leads to a phase of population decline as marginal habitats are occupied and exhausted. This coincides with a peak in conflicts with human land-use interests. A regulated hunting take of healthy beaver populations is recommended as the optimal management regime in managed landscapes. Early provision of interpretation and public viewing opportunities has been a feature of several recent reintroductions. This provides a benefit to the local economy through wildlife tourism, and helps foster positive attitudes to beavers."
584,1292,Predicting the persistence of amphibian populations with the help of a spatial model.,"1. We have used a stochastic population model with immigration to calculate extinction rates for two amphibian species: the common toad, Bufo bufo, and the crested newt, Triturus cristatus. 2. Population models for amphibians are difficult to parameterize. It was not possible to measure all the relevant parameters for the model. The other parameters were obtained from other studies or estimated on the basis of similar species. 3. Contour maps for persistence were generated using the model. The persistence of populations associated with a pond is affected both by the pond's internal dynamics and its proximity to a source pond. On a 20-generation time scale, toad ponds that were initially occupied were relatively unaffected by the proximity of a source. Persistence was almost certain (> 95%) when the average carrying capacity of a pond was greater than 30 adult females. Initially unoccupied toad-ponds were equally likely to persist if they lay within 4 km of a source and could support more than 50 adult females. Initially occupied newt ponds were likely to persist if they supported more than 40 females or lay within 0.5 km of a typical source pond. Initially unoccupied newt ponds were mainly dependent upon immigration rates. Very small ponds (N(k) < 10) could persist if they lay within 0.75 km of a source pond, while large ponds (N(k) >> 10) only needed to be within 1.5 km of a source pond. 4. This model allows us to use the data available, to make predictions about the criteria which must be met by a landscape to ensure the survival of amphibian populations. It offers the possibility of better predictions when the data is refined. The model also suggests directions for further research such as the statistical study of environmental variation, the nature of minimum viable populations for toads and the statistics of long-range dispersal."
585,4620,"Population characteristics of pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus (Forbes & Richardson, 1905), in the lower Platte River, Nebraska","Pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus (Forbes & Richardson, 1905), have been studied intensively in recent years to understand a declining adult population that does not seem to be naturally reproducing; however, most of this effort has occurred in the main-stem Missouri and lower Mississippi rivers. Pallid sturgeon are known to occupy tributary streams intermittently, but the importance of tributaries for completion of essential life stages for pallid sturgeon remains unknown. Tributaries may provide uses for fish spawning and reproduction, nursery or refuge habitat, and areas for foraging. Therefore pallid sturgeon population characteristics were studied in the Platte River, Nebraska, a large tributary to the Missouri River. During 2009-2012 137 pallid sturgeon were captured. Pallid sturgeon were found throughout the lower 159 km of the Platte River throughout the entire year (March-November); however, pallid sturgeon were more abundant in the lower-most 52 km during 2009 and 2010. Capture locations were in comparatively deeper water along flow gradients between the thalweg and mid-channel sandbars. Most pallid sturgeon were of hatchery origin and dispersed an average of 197.5 km (±233 SD) from the original stocking location to the Platte River capture site. Although the direct reasons for are unknown, the lower Platte River may be providing habitat or resources that are not typically found in the channelized Missouri River. Continued research in the Platte River and other large tributaries may provide insight for recovery of endemic, large-river species. Persistence of large-river fishes may depend on population connectivity at multiple scales; identifying these connections is critical."
586,2974,Community-based conservation results in the recovery of reef fish spawning aggregations in the Coral Triangle,"In the Coral Triangle community-based marine protected areas (MPAs) are being established at a prolific rate. Their establishment can benefit both fisheries and biodiversity, and they provide both a socially and economically acceptable means of managing coral reefs in developing nations. However, because such MPAs are typically small (usually <0.5km2), they will rarely provide protection to large mobile fishes. An exception to this limitation may exist when community-based MPAs are established to protect small sites where vital processes occur, such as fish spawning aggregations (FSAs). To test the effectiveness of small (0.1-0.2km2) MPAs for protecting FSAs, we monitored three FSA sites where brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus), camouflage grouper (Epinephelus polyphekadion) and squaretail coralgrouper (Plectropomus areolatus) aggregate to spawn. Sites were monitored during peak reproductive periods (several days prior to each new moon) between January 2005 and November 2009. All three sites are located in New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea, and had been exploited for decades, but in 2004 two sites were protected by the establishment of community-based MPAs. The third site continued to be exploited. Over the monitoring period densities of E. fuscoguttatus and E. polyphekadion increased at both MPAs, but not at the site that remained open to fishing. At one MPA the densities of E. polyphekadion increased tenfold. Our findings demonstrate that community-based MPAs that are appropriately designed and adequately enforced can lead to the recovery of populations of vulnerable species that aggregate to spawn. "
587,2836,The status of bears and restoration projects on the Korean Peninsula,"Two species of bear inhabit the Korean peninsula: the Asiatic black bear and brown bear. However, the danger of extinction is very real for both species, mainly due to past hunting, poaching, and habitat destruction, and thus they are now both designated as threatened species. In North Korea, research on bear breeding and commercial use was conducted by the Zoology Institute of North Korea from 1986 to 1995. In addition, research on various other subjects has been conducted since 1996. In South Korea there has been no research on bears except for a population estimate survey of wild bears during 1980-1984. Recently, the restoration project of Asiatic black bears was revived by the Species Restoration Center of the Korean National Park Service (SRC). This report is based on the above-mentioned re-search and the personal information from a zoologist in North Korea"
588,3383,"Abundance and species composition of amphibians, small mammals, and songbirds in riparian forest buffer strips of varying widths in the boreal mixedwood of Alberta","Forested buffer strips are left along water bodies after forest harvesting to protect water quality and fish stocks, but little is known about their utility as reserves for forest species in managed landscapes. We report on changes in terrestrial vertebrate communities from pre- to post-harvest in experimentally created buffer strips (20, 100, 200, and 800 m wide) in a boreal mixedwood forest in Alberta, Canada. We trapped anuran amphibians and small mammals and spot-mapped bird territories around 12 lakes (4 treatment levels, 3 replicates) before and after harvesting. Changes in small mammal or amphibian abundance were not detected for any treatment relative to controls; however, these species are habitat generalists that used and even bred in clearcuts. Total bird abundance did not change after harvesting, with the exception of crowding in 20-m buffers 1 year post-harvest. Species composition did not change for amphibians and small mammals after harvest, but forest-dependent bird species declined as buffer width narrowed from 200 to 100 m and narrower. We concluded that 20-100 m buffers would not serve as reserves for forest songbirds in managed landscapes, but that 200 m wide strips conserved the pre-harvest passerine bird community, at least up to 3 years post-harvest."
589,1577,Predation on competing rodent species: A simple explanation of complex patterns,"1. We extend a predator-prey model previously parameterized for voles and weasels to two prey species, a 'Microtus' (field vole) type which is competitively superior to but more vulnerable to predation than a 'Clethrionomys' (bank vole) type. 2. The model explains four patterns in the dynamics of multispecies rodent assemblages in Fennoscandia: a predictable shift in the relative abundances of different prey species during one multiannual population cycle; long-term (supracyclic) variation in relative prey abundances; an association between the amplitude of population oscillations and the type of the numerically dominant prey species; and increasing rodent species number with increasing latitude. 3. The model results illustrate the complex and often unexpected behaviour of strongly connected multispecies assemblages, of which the Fennoscandian rodent-predator community is a prime example. 4. Since the mid 1980s, rodent oscillations in many, though not all, parts of northern Fennoscandia have become distinctly less regular (non-cyclic), a change which is reflected in the entire animal community linked to the keystone species, the arvicoline rodents. We demonstrate that such long-term changes in the amplitude and regularity of rodent oscillations are not unexpected in multispecies prey-predator assemblages."
590,1567,Composition of cyclic and non-cyclic vole populations: on the causes of variation in individual quality among Clethrionomys glareolus in Sweden,"A cyclic Clethrionomys glareolus population from north Sweden was compared with a non-cyclic population from south Sweden regarding age structure, body weight, reproductive development and suppression, and sex ratios. The non-cyclic population, after years with winter breeding, was characterized by especially early and intense breeding in spring and many post-reproductive animals in autumn. Non-cyclic populations with no winter reproduction were similar to increase years in cyclic populations. In peak and especially in decline phases of cyclic populations reproduction decreased clearly below the level in non-cyclic populations. Animal weights varied insignificantly between years in the non-cyclic population but changed greatly in the cyclic population. A unifying hypothesis for explaining variations in animal quality between different populations is proposed: Maternal conditions related to food supply are assumed to affect body growth and sexual maturation of the young. Predictions from this hypotheses are outlined and compared with those from competing ideas. "
591,3645,"Natural history of Hoplodactylus stephensi (Reptilia: Gekkonidae) on Stephens Island, Cook Strait, New Zealand","The striped gecko (Hoplodactylus stephensi) is one of the rarest and most elusive of New Zealand's lizards. It is currently known from just three locations; Stephens Island (Takapourewa) in Cook Strait, Maud Island in Pelorus Sound, and the Coromandel Peninsula. The striped gecko is a relatively poorly studied species with little data available on many aspects of its biology. We report on the first estimate of longevity in H. stephensi (a minimum of 16 years) and provide baseline data on population structure, habitat use, morphometrics and pregnancy rate. Our data show the value of permanently marked populations of reptiles available for long-term study by different researchers."
592,3646,Investigating Natural Population Dynamics of Naultinus Manukanus to Inform Conservation Management of New Zealand's Cryptic Diurnal Geckos,"Visually cryptic, long-lived, diurnal green geckos (genus Naultinus) were a significant component of natural ecosystems throughout much of New Zealand prior to human settlement 1800 ya. Since then, habitat modification and introduced mammalian predators have threatened many Naultinus populations, making their survival a conservation priority. However, the visually and behaviorally cryptic nature of Naultinus geckos and a lack of scientific attention pose challenges to their conservation management. We investigate natural population dynamics of the Marlborough Green Gecko (Naultinus manukanus) to act as a model for understanding the ecology of New Zealand's diurnal geckos and to inform conservation management. The largest known N. manukanus population (on mammal-free Stephens Island) has been the focus of several studies along a bush-edge transect. We pooled data obtained using mark-recapture, population census, captive rearing of juveniles and radio telemetric methodologies over 25 yr to examine aspects of their ecology and behavior. The population is female-biased (1:1.7 m:f), a trend that is apparent from birth. Sexual maturity occurs at approximately 4 yr of age and 71% of females reproduce annually. Naultinus manukanus are strictly diurnal, arboreal, and opportunistic thermoregulators. Daily movements are very limited, averaging 0.6 m per day, characteristic of the sit-and-wait foraging strategy that they employ. The basic ecological information presented in this paper provides context for the conservation management of Naultinus species, which are increasingly recognized as threatened in their current ranges.

593,2332,Responses of leopard Panthera pardus to the recovery of a tiger Panthera tigris population,"1. Several conservation initiatives are aiming to improve the status of the rapidly dwindling populations of tiger Panthera tigris. However, possible cascading effects of intra-guild competition on other sympatric carnivores are rarely considered while planning such recovery programmes. 2. In this study, we examine how, following the reduction of anthropogenic pressures by relocation of pastoralists, a recovering tiger population affects leopards Panthera pardus in the Chilla Range of Rajaji National Park (RNP), India. By combining data gathered over 4years (2004-2005 to 2007-2008) on prey availability, food habits and population density of the two predators, we investigate some of the mechanisms of niche partitioning. 3. Based on existing information, we predicted that there would be high dietary overlap between the two predators. Over time, optimal habitats would be dominated by tigers forcing leopards to the periphery of the protected area where they would subsist on small prey and domestic livestock. Consequently, leopards would occur at a lower density where sympatric with tigers. 4. Our results confirmed that annual dietary overlap (0·89, 0·82, 0·78, 0·77) between the two predators was high during the study. As expected, we observed a shift in the diet of leopards towards a significantly higher intake of domestic prey (∼6·8% to ∼31·8%) and small prey (∼9% to ∼36%). Mean leopard density declined from 9·76 animals per 100km2 in 2004-2005 to 2·07 per 100km2 in 2007-2008, while the mean density of tigers increased from 3·31 per 100km2 to 5·81 per 100km2 over the same period. 5. Synthesis and applications. Although based on small sample sizes, our study revealed that over the 4years following the relocation of pastoralists out of RNP, the tiger population recovered but leopard densities declined sharply. The concurrent shift in leopard diet indicated heightened livestock depredation from the surrounding area. Therefore, it is important that conservation initiatives targeting the recovery of tigers should be preceded by careful examination of interspecific interactions with sympatric carnivores. Comprehensive human-carnivore conflict management measures like monitoring the extent of livestock depredation, improving livestock management and providing adequate compensation and/or insurance schemes are critical for successfully implementing such conservation efforts.

594,2643,Status of grey seals along mainland Europe from the southwestern Baltic to France,"The grey seal was a common species along mainland Europe during the Stone Age (8,000-5,500 BC). Along the North Sea coast populations started to decline substantially during the 11th century as a result of excessive hunting. The last breeding populations disappeared in the 16th century in the Wadden Sea, and before 1900 in the Kattegat-Skagerrak and the Southwestern Baltic as a result of an extermination campaign. No regular pupping occurred along mainland Europe until the end of the 1970s, when a breeding colony was established near Amrum in the German Wadden Sea. Somewhat later, additional breeding sites were discovered near Terschelling in the Dutch Wadden Sea (1980), at Helgoland, and off Brittany in France. Tracking of movements indicate these seal groups to be linked to the larger populations in the UK. Numbers of grey seals in the recolonised areas have increased over the years, but in the Kattegat-Skagerrak stable numbers of about 25 individuals have been observed since the 1970s, whereas more than 100 grey seals are found in the Southwestern Baltic. In the southeastern North Sea, 120 grey seals occur during moult at Helgoland, 120 in the German and over 1,130 in the Dutch parts of the Wadden Sea in 2004. Along the southern Dutch and Belgian coasts small groups are regularly observed, but no colonies have yet been established. In the colonies off Brittany in France about 105 grey seals have been counted. Successful pupping has only been recorded 3 times in the Kattegat-Skagerrak over the past 30 years, and 2-4 pups are born annually in France and the Southwestern Baltic. The relative strongholds for breeding along the European continent are the Dutch Wadden Sea, where in 2003/2004 at least 150 pups were recorded, Amrum in the German Wadden Sea (23 pups) and Helgoland (8 pups). Consequently, total numbers of counted grey seals from the Southwestern Baltic to France amounted to at least 1,600 in 2004, while about 190 pups were born in the area."
595,1875,"The decline of the endemic Fijian crested iguana Brachylophus vitiensis in the Yasawa and Mamanuca archipelagos, western Fiji","The endemic Fijian crested iguana Brachylophus vitiensis, categorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, has been recorded from several islands in western Fiji. We conducted a survey for the crested iguana on 12 uninhabited and five inhabited islands in the Yasawa and Mamanuca archipelagos of western Fiji in September 2000. Night searches for sleeping iguanas along a total of 11.2 km of forest transects suggest that crested iguanas are either extremely rare or extinct on all of these islands. Although we collectively searched a total of 44 km of transect over 123 person hours, we located crested iguanas on only four islands: three small uninhabited islands (all <73 ha) and one large inhabited island (22 km). In July 2003 we resurveyed two islands identified as having the best potential for the long-term conservation of crested iguanas, and found that populations were continuing to decline. We suggest that the scarcity of crested iguanas on all islands surveyed is due to the combination of habitat loss and the introduction of exotic predators. All islands surveyed have free ranging goats, forest fires have occurred repeatedly over the last few decades, and feral cats are established on many islands. To reverse the population decline of this species immediate intervention is required on selected islands to halt continuing forest degradation and to clarify the effects of introduced predators. "
596,3072,Occurrence and changing numbers of Hudsonian Godwits during southward migration in the eastern United States,"This study summarizes information on Hudsonian Godwit numbers and occurrence in the continental United States (excluding Alaska). Evaluations from southward migration on the coasts of Massachusetts and Virginia show that generally predictable numbers regularly visit certain key sites. Data from these sites show (1) the southward migration phenology (peak counts of adults during mid and late August), (2) greater numbers in Massachusetts than in Virginia prior to juvenile migration, but greater numbers in Virginia after the peak adult migration, (3) increasing counts of Hudsonian Godwits at Atlantic stopovers from the 1960s to the 1970s, but a decreasing trend since. Our studies also confirm that Hudsonian Godwits mainly use stopovers in the interior of the United States during northward migration and Atlantic coast sites during southward migration."
597,1749,"Status and trends of Tibetan plateau mammalian fauna, Yeniugou, China","We conducted surveys focusing on the unique and vulnerable ungulate species in Yeniugou, Qinghai province, China, during September 1997 to compare population estimates with those from the early 1990s. The status of two ungulate species appeared essentially unchanged since 1990-1992: wild yak Bos grunniens (about 1200 to 1300 animals) and Tibetan gazelle Procapra picticaudata. The status of one ungulate species, the white-lipped deer Cervus albirostris, appeared to improve, from a very few to close to 100. We are unsure how the status of the Tibetan wild ass Equus kiang compares with that of the early 1990s. The status of three species declined during the period: blue sheep Pseudois nayaur and argali Ovis ammon declined slightly (possibly due to a weather event), and the Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsoni declined dramatically (probably due primarily to poaching), from over 2000 estimated in 1991 to only two seen during 1997. Poaching of antelope has become a serious problem throughout the Tibetan plateau in recent years, and this survey provides evidence that an entire subpopulation can disappear (either through mortality, movement away from human disturbance or a combination) within a relatively short time-frame. That some species (e.g. wild yak, white-lipped deer) continue to thrive in Yeniugou is heartening, but even they remain vulnerable to market-driven poaching."
598,1657,"The ecology of the hippopotamus in Liwonde National Park, Malawi: implications for management","The hippopotamus population in Liwonde National Park, Malawi was studied from December 2002 to June 2003. Motorboat censuses along the River Shire counted 640 animals, but because of the large number of hippos in temporary water sources at the time, the true number is probably closer to 950. Marked shifts in hippo distribution from the Shire into temporary water sources occurred as the wet season advanced. Because of the Shire's year-round water supply, the hippo population is not regulated by the availability of aquatic refuges, but by food availability. By following feeding tracks, dry season grazing range was estimated to extend 5 km east and 1 km west of the river. Grazing intensity transects and visual estimates indicated only a small portion of this area is suitable for hippo grazing, leading to over-grazing in suitable areas. Coupled with low primary productivity levels in Liwonde, this means that dry season food competition between hippos and other herbivores is probably high. Recent proposals to raise the Shire's dry season water level should be considered very carefully, as this will flood late dry season grazing grounds, thereby intensifying grazing competition and increasing grazing pressure in remaining grazing areas, having potentially serious impacts on the animal community.

599,3710,"Kuujjua River Arctic char: monitoring stock trends using catches from an under-ice subsistence fishery, Victoria Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, 1991-2009","A standardized, harvest-based monitoring program was conducted during the main under-ice subsistence fishery for Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) of the Kuujjua River for 18 winter fishing seasons between 1991 and 2009. The program was a response to the concern of Ulukhaktok residents that Arctic char were becoming fewer in number and smaller in size. Mean harvests averaged 1225 (SD 262) Arctic char annually for 1996  2002 and 568 (SD 274) in 2003  09, or roughly 40% and 20% of the harvest levels estimated for 1971  78 (2900, SD 842) and 1988  92 (2943, SD 1072). There was no statistical relationship between the size of the annual harvest (number of fish), and the corresponding mean annual catch per unit effort (CPUE) value (R2 = 0.0141, p = 0.761). Arctic char were fully recruited to the fishery at age nine, with 82.4% of the sampled catch (n = 3288) ranging between 8 and 12 years and composed almost exclusively (99%) of non-spawning adults. Over the time series, temporal trends were not detected (p > 0.05) in mean annual CPUE (27.3 Arctic char/100 m/24 h, SD 14.15), mean fork length (593 mm, SD 78.1), or mean age (9.9 years, SD 2.0). Annual mortality rate showed a weak, but significant, decreasing trend over the series (R2 = 0.354), and there were no statistical trends in annual values of the Brody growth coefficient (R2 = 0.1337, p = 0.164). Variation in mean annual somatic condition indices was correlated with timing of sea ice clearance in spring (R2 = 0.474, p = 0.002), probably because prey quality, quantity, or both are higher in summers following earlier spring blooms in the marine environment. Together, the absence of temporal trends in CPUE, fork length, and age of the harvested fish and the apparent improvement in survival (lower mortality), suggest that the stock has been stable at the harvest levels observed during the monitoring period. The stock may also be realizing some improved fitness, which is due to changes in environmental productivity and appears to be linked, at least in part, to the timing of spring breakup in eastern Amundsen Gulf."

Monitoring was conducted by making use of camera traps, which were strategically placed by using a stratified sampling method based on the area of concentration of Javan rhino. The population size of Javan rhino in 2013 was a minimal 58 individuals consisting of 8 calves and 50 sub adults or adults with a sex ratio of 35 males: 23 females. The birth rate was recorded at 13.79% while the mortality rate was 3.45%. We also recorded 4 new calves in 2013."
601,4494,"Demography of an island population of the lizard, Eumeces okadae, on Miyake-jima, Izu Islands","The demography of the lizard Eumeces okadae was studied for 4 years on Miyake-jima, in the Izu Islands, central Japan. Most males matured at 3 years of age with a mean snout-vent length of 77.5 mm. Females matured at 3-4 years with a mean SVL of 77.8 mm, and reproduced biennially thereafter. Growth continued after maturity with a decreasing rate. In females, annual growth was negligible in reproductive years, but resumed markedly in non-reproductive years. Clutch size increased with SVL and was used to construct a fecundity schedule. Population density (exclusive of hatchlings) was estimated to be ca. 4000 individuals/ha in August, an exceptionally high density for lizards. Before introduction of the weasel onto Miyake-jima, low predation pressure had allowed E. okadae to maintain a high population density. Estimated annual survival rates were 36% for hatchlings, 56% for yearlings, 80% for 2-year-olds, 63% for adult males and 76% for adult females. The cohort generation time (6.95 years) was so long that the E. okadae population can be characterized by a combination of low natality and slow turnover. "
602,1551,"Using annual body size fluctuations to explore potential causes for the decline in a nesting population of the loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta at Senri Beach, Japan","The annual recruitment dynamics and body size fluctuations in adult female loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta nesting on Senri Beach in Minabe, Japan from 1990 to 2001 were investigated along with the number of nests, so that the causes for the recent population decline could be assessed. The number of nests decreased from 335 in 1990 to 29 in 1998, and slightly increased thereafter. The recruit percentage (i. e. the percentage of recruits out of total identified females in each year) varied from 39 to 75%. The lack of a significant correlation between the rates of change in the recruit percentage and in the number of nests suggested that the population decline had been caused by factors affecting both recruits and remigrants. The mean straight carapace length (SCL) varied from 825 to 855 mm. The significant negative correlation between the rates of change in the mean SCL and in the number of nests suggested that the decline had been caused by the decrease in the number of small females. The lack of a significant difference in SCL between recruits and remigrants supported the above scenarios. Since small females tend to inhabit the pelagic Pacific irrespective of their recruit or remigrant status, we proposed that the population decline at Senri Beach was attributable to factors operating in the pelagic waters, such as incidental mortality by longline fisheries."
603,2899,Population Dynamics of Hawaiian Seabird Colonies Vulnerable to Sea-Level Rise,"Globally, seabirds are vulnerable to anthropogenic threats both at sea and on land. Seabirds; typically nest colonially and show strong fidelity to natal colonies, and such colonies on low-lying islands may; be threatened by sea-level rise. We used French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Hawaiian Archipelago,; as a case study to explore the population dynamics of seabird colonies and the potential effects sea-level; rise may have on these rookeries. We compiled historic observations, a 30-year time series of seabird population; abundance, lidar-derived elevations, and aerial imagery of all the islands of French Frigate Shoals.; To estimate the population dynamics of 8 species of breeding seabirds on Tern Island from 1980 to 2009,; we used a Gompertz model with a Bayesian approach to infer population growth rates, density dependence,; process variation, and observation error. All species increased in abundance, in a pattern that provided evidence; of density dependence. Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor), Masked Boobies (Sula dactylatra), Red-tailed; Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda), Spectacled Terns (Onychoprion lunatus), and White Terns (Gygis alba) are; likely at carrying capacity. Density dependence may exacerbate the effects of sea-level rise on seabirds because; populations near carrying capacity on an island will be more negatively affected than populations with room; for growth. We projected 12% of French Frigate Shoals will be inundated if sea level rises 1 m and 28% if; sea level rises 2 m. Spectacled Terns and shrub-nesting species are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise, but; seawalls and habitat restoration may mitigate the effects of sea-level rise. Losses of seabird nesting habitat; may be substantial in the Hawaiian Islands by 2100 if sea levels rise 2 m. Restoration of higher-elevation; seabird colonies represent a more enduring conservation solution for Pacific seabirds."
604,4569,Low density populations of anemonefish with low replenishment rates on a reef edge with anthropogenic impacts,"The population dynamics of anemonefish are expected to have unique patterns because of the symbiotic relationship with host anemones. Recent anthropogenic impacts may affect the abundance of anemones, which may also affect population dynamics of anemonefish. However, long-term field studies and demographic data on reproduction, immigration, and mortality rates are deficient. Here, we investigated the dynamics of anemonefish for 3 years on the reef edge with anthropogenic impacts of Okinawa-jima Island, southern Japan. During the study period, six species of host anemone were used as spawning grounds by four species of anemonefish, and as nurseries by six species of immature anemonefish. The density of breeding pairs was low (0.21–1.46 /ha), which may have been restricted by the abundance of host anemones. Survival rates were different among species; from 0.21 to 1.00 over 3 years. Ten cases of dissolution of breeding pairs were observed during the 3 years, and only five pairs were replenished. Through the study period, 215 individuals of six species of immature fish immigrated into the study site, and this number was skewed due to higher numbers of Amphiprion clarkii (77.7%). Demographic patterns differed among species, and requirements for conservation will therefore be different among species on the reef edges of Okinawa-jima Island under anthropogenic impact."
605,1667,Good news for sea turtles,"Following the overexploitation of sea turtle populations, conservation measures are now in place in many areas. However, the overall impact of these measures is often unknown because there are few long time-series showing trends in population sizes. In a recent paper, George Balazs and Milani Chaloupka chart the number of green turtles Chelonia mydas nesting in Hawaii over the past 30 years and reveal a remarkably quick increase in the size of this population following the instigation of conservation measures during the 1970s. Importantly, this work shows how even a small population of sea turtles can recover rapidly, suggesting that Allee effects do not impede conservation efforts in operation worldwide."
606,2834,"The reintroduction of large carnivores to the Eastern Cape, South Africa: an assessment","Recently, conservation estate in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province has increased 10-fold resulting in large predators being increasingly reintroduced to restore ecological integrity and maximize tourism. We describe the reintroductions of large carnivores (>10 kg) that have occurred in the Eastern Cape and use various criteria to assess their success. Lion Panthera leo reintroduction has been highly successful with a population of 56 currently extant in the region and problems of overpopulation arising. The African wild dog Lycaon pictus population has increased to 24 from a founder population of 11. Preliminary results for spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta also indicate success. Wild populations of leopards Panthera pardus exist on several reserves and have been supplemented by translocated individuals, although deaths of known individuals have occurred and no estimate of reproduction is available. Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus reintroduction has also been less successful with 36 individuals reintroduced and 23 cubs being born but only 41 individuals surviving in 2005. Criteria for assessing the success of reintroductions of species that naturally occur in low densities, such as top predators, generally have limited value. Carrying capacity for large predators is unknown and continued monitoring and intensive management will be necessary in enclosed, and possibly all, conservation areas in the Eastern Cape to ensure conservation success."
607,760,"Elk population dynamics in areas with and without predation by recolonizing wolves in Banff National Park, Alberta","Gray wolves (Canis lupus) recolonized the Bow Valley of Banff National Park in the mid-1980s after a 30-year absence. Wolves recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991, but human activity excluded wolves from a third zone throughout the study. Elk (Cervus elaphus) are the primary prey of wolves in Banff National Park. We studied the effects of wolf predation, snow depth, elk density, and human-caused mortality on the elk population growth rate in the three different wolf recolonization treatments from 1985 to 2000. We constructed a set of generalized linear models of factors affecting population growth, and used Akaike Information Criteria to guide model selection and inference. In the low wolf predation zone, elk population growth was density-dependent and limited by human-caused mortality. In the zone that wolves recolonized in 1991, elk population growth was limited by the combined effects of snow depth and wolf predation after wolf recolonization, in addition to preexisting mortality caused by humans and other predators. Our correlative approach failed to yield insights into population dynamics in the zone where wolves were present throughout the study. However, by comparing zones we demonstrate important differences in ungulate population dynamics in the presence and absence of wolf predation."
608,3257,"Microhabitat selection of woody debris by Dekay's brownsnake (Storeria dekayi) in a dune habitat in Ontario, Canada","Understanding habitat selection is a fundamental goal of ecology and is vitally important for effective species conservation.; Dekays Brownsnake (Storeria dekayi; hereafter Brownsnake) is one of the most widespread snake species in eastern North America, and its; association with cover objects is generally well known, but details regarding choice of refuges are largely unknown. We investigated Dekays; Brownsnake microhabitat use during annual surveys at Point Pelee National Park, Ontario, Canada from 1990 to 2010. We systematically; checked all woody debris in stabilized dune habitat for snakes and noted the size and state of decay of woody debris that was used. Nearly all; of our observations were of gravid females under woody debris. Greater use of large, moderately decayed woody debris relative to the range of; available debris provided strong evidence of selection. Although most snakes observed were solitary, we found a significant number of; aggregations. Female Brownsnakes appear to migrate to stabilized dune from other habitats in the park to select suitable woody debris for; gestation and parturition. Although these refuge sites would reduce predation risk, they also provide a moister and cooler microclimate than; ambient conditions. Numerous observations of shed skins also suggested that this woody debris provides important microhabitat for ecdysis.; Analysis of relative abundance over time showed considerable variation in numbers (131/yr) and an increasing trend. Our results provide; strong evidence of microhabitat selection by this species and highlight the importance of not making generalizations about microhabitat; requirements, even for common snake species."
609,747,Changes in the composition of a ranid frog community following bullfrog extinction,"Natural experiments have often shown that lowered competition or predation results in patterns of ecological release, density compensation, or predatory release of target species. At Point Pelee National Park, Ontario, Canada, from 1992 to 1994, we conducted extensive surveys of habitats to document patterns of relative abundance and distribution of amphibians and to compare these patterns with those documented in studies conducted in 1972 and 1991. Bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) have not been observed since spring 1990 and are now considered to be locally extinct in the park. Relative abundance of the green frog (R. clamitans) has increased 4X since bullfrog extinction. Similarities in the natural history of bullfrogs and green frogs suggest that interactions should be greatest between this pair. The predaceous habits of bullfrogs are well-documented, and the experimental literature suggests that bullfrogs and green frogs are competitors. Changes in the pattern of ranid relative abundance that we observed suggest that the bullfrog is important in structuring amphibian communities."
610,748,Spatial scale and determination of species status of the green frog,"Although the importance of spatial scale in determining species status (abundance and distribution) is widely recognized, most ecological investigations have been conducted at local scales. Our goal was to investigate the importance of spatial scale in assessing the status of the green frog (Rana clamitans melanota) in the center of its range in eastern North America. Using repeated surveys at 160 ponds from 1992 to 1994, we investigated patterns of occupancy, abundance, and turnover at local, sub-regional, regional, and geographic scales to determine the status of the green frog in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Patterns of pond occupancy were stable at the geographic scale. Occupancy was stable in two regions and decreased in one. At the sub-regional scale, occupancy was stable in six sub-regions, increased in one, and decreased in two. Patterns of adult abundance were stable at the geographic scale. At the regional scale trends in adult abundance were increasing, decreasing, or stable in each of three regions. At the sub-regional scale abundance was stable in three, increasing in one, decreasing in two, and no trend occurred in three sub-regions. At the local scale abundance was stable at 20% of ponds, increased at 17.8%, decreased at 14.4%, and no trend existed at 47.8%. Colonization and extinction rates ranged from 0 to 0.20 and 0 to 0.35 ponds/pond occupied/year, respectively, and differed among regions. Local extinctions took place at 25% of ponds during the study, but no sub-regional or regional scale extinctions occurred. Small populations (<10 adults/pond) were prone to local extinction. Determination of the status of the green frog is scale dependent. Although green frog populations are dynamic, it is common and stable at the geographic scale, but its status varies among regions or sub-regions. Although processes that negatively affect a species may operate at the local scale, a large-scale perspective is necessary to determine status."
611,749,"Effects of human disturbance on five-lined skink, Eumeces fasciatus, abundance and distribution","We studied the effects of human disturbance on five-lined skinks at Point Pelee National Park, Canada. Surveys indicated low skink abundance and a lack of woody debris in areas heavily used by humans and a downward population trend concurrent with high disturbance levels. Skinks preferentially used large moderately decayed logs and boards for refuge sites. Human disturbance resulted in degradation and removal of debris. Degradation by fragmentation and accelerated decay resulted in decreased quality of available debris. To test the hypothesis that skink absence in human high-use areas was caused by a lack of suitable debris, we placed artificial microhabitats in areas which previously lacked woody debris and skinks. Experimental debris were colonized quickly and heavily used despite high disturbance rates. Skinks are resilient to minor disturbances such as displacements, but not to removal or degradation of debris. Essential microhabitat features must be actively preserved as well as suitable habitat to ensure the conservation of target species."
612,2723,DNA-based monitoring of two newly founded Scandinavian wolverine populations,"The wolverine is an endangered carnivore that in northwestern Europe is restricted to the mountain range along the border between Sweden and Norway. The Scandinavian wolverine population experienced a severe decline in numbers due to human persecution during the 20th century, although with legislative protection the population has recently implied that the population slowly has started to recover (current population size estimate of 800 individuals). In the mid 1990s, wolverines appeared in two new and isolated areas east of the mountain range, in the forest landscape close to the Gulf of Bothnia. Using non-invasive, DNA-based monitoring, we show here that these new subpopulations were likely founded by as few as 2 and 2-4 individuals, respectively, and that little, if any, genetic contact with the main population since colonisation has been established. A high degree of genetic similarity among individuals in the two areas indicates inbreeding. We estimate the minimum number of wolverines known to be alive in these areas during the period of 2001-2005 to 5 and 17, respectively, with one subpopulation showing decreasing (currently 2) numbers and the other increasing (10). For the somewhat larger population, we infer a tentative pedigree from relatedness values and parentage tests, which indicates the occurrence of brother-sister matings. This study illustrates the usefulness of non-invasive monitoring in the management of endangered carnivore populations. "
613,949,Time-series data for a selection of forty fish species caught during the International Bottom Trawl Survey,"Relative abundance estimates of 40 fish species caught during the ICES coordinated International Bottom Trawl Survey are presented for the period 1970-1993. Trends in survey catches for eight commercial species are compared with total stock biomass estimates derived from stock assessment. In general, there is a remarkably good correspondence between these two independent parameters, suggesting that the survey is capable of registering significant changes in abundance. Among the 40 species, there are many more showing a positive trend during recent years than a negative one. However, the commercial species are all either declining or are stable. The most significant changes are observed in 'southern' species, which is probably related to a period of relatively warm winters after 1990. In many resident species, however, that appear to the increasing over a prolonged period of time, this explanation does not seem to apply."
614,1344,Threats to a small population: a census and conservation recommendations for wild buffalo Bubalus arnee in Nepal,"We censused wild buffalo Bubalus arnee in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Nepal, in March 2004 using methods employed in earlier surveys, and estimated a population of 159 animals. Since the last census in 2000 the management situation has deteriorated. Guard posts have been evacuated due to the Maoist insurgency. The entire Army Battalion usually posted in the Reserve was at Headquarters at the time of this study and therefore there were no patrols over most of the Reserve, and much human encroachment. Mortality from flooding and road deaths, and possibly poaching for meat, were evident, and males suffered more mortality overall than females. Despite these threats the population had increased since 2000, albeit at a lower rate than previously. Active management, including interventions within the Reserve and a translocation of some individuals to Chitwan National Park, are recommended. "
615,3702,Rodent populations on the northern Great Plains respond to weather variation at a landscape scale,"Extreme weather variation on the northern Great Plains of North America can potentially influence the; abundance of grassland rodents across vast areas. We used the remains of 33,697 small mammals collected from; owl pellets in central and western Canada over 15 years to determine the influence of weather on the annual; abundance of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), sagebrush voles (Lemmiscus curtatus), and meadow voles; (Microtus pennsylvanicus). Weather variation affected the annual abundances of all 3 species; however,; influence on deer mouse and sagebrush vole annual abundances was relatively small compared to that on; meadow voles. This finding may indicate that factors other than weather (i.e., habitat availability) are more; important for the abundance of deer mice and sagebrush voles at the landscape scale. In contrast, meadow voles; were positively associated with the duration of snow cover above the hiemal threshold (20 cm), exhibiting up to; 5-fold increases (i.e., irruptions) in abundance following winters of persistent, deep snow cover. Our study is the; first to examine the effects of weather on landscape-scale abundance of rodent species on the northern Great; Plains of North America, providing further insight into the role weather plays in driving rodent population; fluctuations in this highly seasonal environment."
616,3467,"The biology of tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, in Shark Bay, Western Australia: sex ratio, size distribution, diet, and seasonal changes in catch rates","Tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, are apex predators in a variety of nearshore ecosystems throughout the world. This study investigates the biology of tiger sharks in the shallow seagrass ecosystem of Shark Bay, Western Australia. Tiger sharks (n = 252) were the most commonly caught species (94%) compared to other large sharks. Tiger sharks ranged from 148-407 cm TL. The overall sex ratio was biased towards females (1.8: 1), but the sex ratio of mature animals (> 300 cm TL) did not differ from 1: 1. Contrary to previous accounts, tiger sharks were caught more often in all habitats during daylight hours than at night. Tiger shark catch rates were highly correlated with water temperature and were highest when water temperatures were above 19°C. The seasonal abundance of tiger sharks is correlated to both water temperature and the occurrence of their main prey: sea snakes and dugongs, Dugong dugon. Stomach contents analysis indicated that sea turtles and smaller elasmobranchs were also common prey. The importance of major seagrass grazers (dugongs and green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas) in the diet of tiger sharks suggests the possibility that these sharks are keystone predators in this ecosystem."
617,2489,Population trends and harvest management of pine marten Martes martes in Scandinavia,"In this paper, I describe historical and present harvesting and population trends of pine marten Martes martes in Scandinavia, based on a literature review and analyses of harvest statistics and population indices. The pine marten population has experienced two periods of over-harvesting with subsequent large-scale declines in population density and local extinctions; in the 1500-1600s and in the early 1900s. The principal incentive for harvesting appears to have been economic (valuable pelt), but eradication efforts may have compounded the effect on the population. In the last decades, the pine marten population density has increased. At present, it is receding but pine martens are still harvested intensively. I discuss implications for management, and caution about over-harvesting of the Scandinavian pine marten population in a near future."
618,2397,"The changes of distribution and population density of wildcats Felis silvestris Schreber, 1775 in Hungary between 1987-2001","The wildcat is one of the most endangered carnivore species in Europe. The population density declined and the distribution area became fragmented over the last century due to the hybridisation, loss of habitat, illegal hunting and road kills (Stahl and Artois 1994). However, a slight increase in the population density could be found in Belgium, France, Germany and Slovenia over the last few decades due to the recolonisation and reintroductions (Stahl and Artois 1994). Wildcats have been protected in Hungary since 1973, but the situation of this species was not been investigated until 1987. Mail questionnaire surveys were conducted between 1987 and 2001 to evaluate the changes of population density and distribution. Clear decrease of the wildcat population distribution range, constant and serious decrease in the population density could be found in Hungary between 1987 and 2001. The stable areas of the species' occurrence are the Transdanubian and the Northern Middle Altitude Mountains, the Drava plain, the Mecsek and the Villanyi Mountains and the forests of floodplains in the Great Plain. The protection of this species have to be intensified with a species protection plan, which contains the wildcat reserve areas with strict protective management measures."

620,191,"Barasingha in Suklaphanta wildlife reserve, Nepal.",Between 1988 and 1993 six periods of field study were undertaken to investigate the environmental impact of the construction of a main irrigation canal and other works in the proposed extension of Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve and to recommend protective measures. Suklaphanta is administered by His Majesty’s Government of Nepal through the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation. Special emphasis was placed upon the barasingha Cervus duvauceli population because it is the largest remaining group of this endangered deer species in the world. This paper presents recommendations for the management of the barasingha and its habitat. 
621,2052,Evidence for a recent Henslow's sparrow population increase in Illinois,"The Henslow's sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) is a species of high conservation concern due to long-term population declines and a small global population. Habitat loss is considered to be the most likely cause of Henslows sparrow declines and the recent establishment of large acreages of undisturbed grasslands through the Conservation Reserve Program is considered to have the potential to benefit populations. I used data from Illinois' Spring Bird Count to estimate recent population trends and examine the association that changes in land-use, especially the establishment of Conservation Reserve Program lands, have had on local Henslow's sparrow population trends. My analysis shows that Henslow's sparrow populations have increased substantially within Illinois, USA over the last 10 years and that this population increase strongly coincides with the establishment of >400,000 ha of grasslands within the state by the Conservation Reserve Program. New rules allowing for managed haying and grazing on Conservation Reserve Program grasslands have the potential to reduce the suitability of program fields for this species and, thus, Henslow's sparrow use of program fields should be monitored as the new rules are implemented."
622,3832,Demographic Variability and Density-Dependent Dynamics of a Free-Ranging Rhesus Macaque Population,"Density-dependence is hypothesized as the major mechanism of population regulation. However, the lack of long?term demographic data has hampered the use of density?dependent models in nonhuman primates. In this study, we make use of the long-term demographic data from Cayo Santiagos rhesus macaques to parameterize and analyze both a density?independent and a density?dependent population matrix model, and compare their projections with the observed population changes. We also employ a retrospective analysis to determine how variance in vital rates, and covariance among them, contributed to the observed variation in long?term fitness across different levels of population density. The population exhibited negative density?dependence in fertility and the model incorporating this relationship accounted for 98% of the observed population dynamics. Variation in survival and fertility of sexually active individuals contributed the most to the variation in long?term fitness, while vital rates displaying high temporal variability exhibited lower sensitivities. Our findings are novel in describing density-dependent dynamics in a provisioned primate population, and in suggesting that selection is acting to lower the variance in the population growth rate by minimizing the variation in adult survival at high density. Because density-dependent mechanisms may become stronger in wild primate populations due to increasing habitat loss and food scarcity, our study demonstrates that it is important to incorporate variation in population size, as well as demographic variability into population viability analyses for a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating the growth of primate populations."
623,3858,Unanticipated effect of climate change on an aquatic top predator of the Atlantic rainforest,"From a biodiversity conservation viewpoint it is crucial to estimate the sensitivity of species and populations to climate change, especially of key species such as top predators. Here, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO) was used as a natural experiment to estimate the sensitivity of a population of the rainforest-dwelling broad-snouted caiman, Caiman latirostris, to extreme floods. Caiman abundance declined by 35% annually between 1996 and 1998, and then increased, without reaching 1996 levels, indicating a marked effect of the 1997 El Niño. Accordingly, the Southern Oscillation Index was positively correlated with caiman abundance, indicating lower caiman abundance with warm ENSO events. The relationship between the relative annual mean abundance of caimans and the maximum daily annual discharge of the Iguazú River was analysed. This relationship was parabolic, with caiman abundance increasing at discharges from 500 to 1500m3s-1 and then decreasing at discharges from 1500 to 2500m3s-1, indicating an adverse effect of both extreme low and high river discharge. No effect of illegal hunting was measurable. This study evaluated whether the negative effect of extremely high water levels on caiman abundance could be due to a decrease in the availability of the habitat more commonly used by small (<60cm total length, TL) and medium (60-120cm TL) caimans. Small and medium-sized caimans used herbaceous/shrub habitats more frequently than large caimans (> 120cm TL), i.e. the type of habitat flooded during extreme floods. An increase in extreme floods, as forecast for the Atlantic rainforest owing to climate change, may seriously affect the population of rainforest caimans through the reduction of adequate habitat for juveniles. This counter-intuitive result, in which an excess of water reduces the abundance of an aquatic top predator, should be considered in conservation plans of rainforest-dwelling crocodilians."
624,2557,Inter-agency coordination fosters the recovery of the Pyrenean chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica at its western limit,"Two political jurisdictions in northern Spain, Navarre, where the Pyrenean chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica is categorized as Vulnerable, and Aragon, where it is huntable, coordinated management for the recovery of this subspecies at the western limit of its range. After an estimate of only a small population in 1992-1993 hunting was banned in Aragon and, in 1995-1996, monitoring of both populations began. In the two massifs where the subspecies lives, which lie across the border of the two jurisdictions, chamois populations increased from 33 to 136 and from 144 to 455 by 2007 (average annual increases were 15 and 11%, respectively). The subspecies was also located on a third massif, in 2002. After the recovery the ban against hunting was lifted in Aragon, in 2006, with a sustainable hunting quota based on 5% of the estimated minimum population size. We conclude that coordinated management between agencies in two jurisdictions has fostered the recovery of the Pyrenean chamois. "
625,3525,Spawning aggregations of Lutjanus cyanopterus (Cuvier) on the Belize Barrier Reef over a 6 year period.,"Cubera snapper Lutjanus cyanopterus aggregated to spawn at Gladden Spit, a salient sub-surface reef promontory seaward of the emergent reef and near the continental shelf edge of Belize. Their spawning aggregations typically formed 2 days before to 12 days after full moon from March to September 19982003 within a 45 000 m2 reef area. Peak abundance of 4000 to 10 000 individuals was observed between April and July each year, while actual spawning was most frequently observed in May. Spawning was observed consistently from 40 min before to 10 min after sunset within a confined area <1000 m2. Data suggested that cubera snapper consistently formed seasonal spawning aggregations in relation to location, photoperiod, water temperature and lunar cycle, and that spawning was cued by time of day but not tides. The cubera snapper aggregation site was included within the Gladden Spit Marine Reserve, a conditional no-take fishing zone."
626,4417,Eastern massasauga demography and extinction risk under prescribed‐fire scenarios," The use of poorly estimated or surrogate population parameter estimates to assess population viability may result in misleading predictions. Consequently, a critical first step to understanding population health and the effects of land management practices on threatened species is estimation of site?specific demographic parameters. A major threat to the eastern massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) is habitat loss due to encroachment of woody vegetation and invasive species. Current land management practices require periodic burning or mowing to maintain habitat suitability. Although these methods improve habitat quality, they may also increase the risk of depredation due to reduced ground cover if burns are too extensive or cause mortality if conducted when snakes are active. We fitted contemporary capturerecapture and matrix models to an 8?year dataset to estimate population parameters for an eastern massasauga population near the range center of the species, where the largest number of eastern massasauga populations may still persist. From 2009 to 2016, we captured 826 eastern massasaugas 1,776 times. In general, annual survival increased with increasing age (age 0?=?0.38, age 1?=?0.65, age 2?=?0.67, age ?3 females?=?0.71, age ?3 males?=?0.66). Abundance estimates ranged from 84 to 140 adults and annual reproductive frequency was 0.44 (95% CI?=?0.290.59). We simulated increased mortality due to prescribed burns during spring, fall, and late fall for 50 and 100 years. The baseline model, which incorporated current prescribed?fire practices, indicated a stable population with only a 0.20.6% probability of extinction over 100 years, suggesting that management practices at this site are sustainable if they remain unchanged. Simulations of conservative increases in mortality due to fire changed the probability of extinction little over 50 years (?0.7%) but increased probability of extinction up to 24.5% over 100 years in the most pessimistic prescribed?burn scenario. These prescribed?burn simulations may be comparable to burn regimes used at other eastern massasauga sites. The population parameters estimated here provide information needed for assessing range?wide population viability and investigating geographic variation in eastern massasauga demography."
627,4254,"Demography of the Puerto Rican Racer, Borikenophis portoricensis (Squamata: Dipsadidae), on Guana Island, British Virgin Islands","Guana is a 297-ha island in the British Virgin Islands, a private wildlife sanctuary where human activity is largely restricted to small areas associated with an upscale resort hotel. Guana is free of mongooses and sustains a population of racers (Borikenophis portoricensis; Dipsadidae). Between 2001 and 2012 we marked B. portoricensis with Trovan passive integrated transponders and recorded 394 captures of 367 unique adults (males = 167; females = 200; sex ratio of 0.8 : 1) in an effective trapping area of 25.8 ha. Using contemporary capture-recapture models, we estimated annual adult apparent survival, abundance, and realized population growth. We detected no difference in apparent adult annual survival of males (0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.34-0.66) and females (0.50, 95% CI = 0.33-0.66). Recapture probabilities of males (0.09, 95% CI = 0.04-0.18) and females (0.08, 95% CI = 0.04-0.16) were similarly indistinguishable. Annual estimates of adult abundance ranged from 368 to 540, but confidence intervals overlapped broadly between years. We estimated realized population growth as 0.98 (95% CI = 0.75-1.28) over the 12-yr study. Based on the effective trapping area (25.8 ha), average density was 19 adults/ha (range = 14-21 adults/ha). The low recapture probabilities suggest that animals spend much of their lives in areas not accessible to researchers, but we detected little evidence of substantive movement. The population on Guana appears to be healthy, suggesting that declines elsewhere are indeed the results of human activities, especially the introduction of mongooses."
628,3558,An assessment of toothfish in Subarea 48.3 using CASAL,"This paper presents an assessment of the stock of toothfish around South Georgia (Subarea 48.3) using the CASAL stock assessment software (Bull et al., 2005). Detailed attention is given to the incorporation of as much of the available tuning data as possible, as well as a whole range of assessment sensitivities - to fixed parametric assumptions, model structures and alternative data scenarios. Given the integrated nature of the assessment, particular attention is given to rigorous statistical weighting of the various tuning datasets. Bayesian methods are used in the estimation procedure, and uncertainty in the dynamics is explored using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods; methods for fast approximations to the more time-consuming MCMC tools and CASAL-specific convergence checking tools are also detailed. Finally, long-term yield calculations were undertaken, given the CCAMLR decision rules, for five main assessment candidates."
629,3391,Aerial surveys of Greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons frontalis and other waterfowl in the Rasmussen Lowlands of the Central Canadian Arctic,"Helicopter surveys were carried out in June 1994-95 to determine the numbers and distribution of Greater White-fronted Geese Anser albifrons frontalis and other waterfowl in the Rasmussen Lowlands of the Central Canadian Arctic. The results provide information needed for the management of Greater White-fronted Geese as well as for evaluating the biological importance of the Rasmussen Lowlands as a potential 'protected area'. Estimated numbers of waterfowl in the 6,265km2 survey area were 42,041 Lesser Snow Geese Anser caerulescens caerulescens, 23,516 Greater White-fronted Geese, 13,690 King Eiders Somateria spectabilis, 6,412 Canada Geese Branta canadensis hutchinsii, 5,427 Long-tailed Ducks Clangula hyemalis and 3,822 Tundra Swans Cygnus columbianus. Smaller numbers of several other species of aquatic and terrestrial birds were observed and minimum population estimates are reported for those species as well. Numbers of Lesser Snow, Greater White-fronted and Canada Geese have increased substantially in the Rasmussen Lowlands since the mid-1970s, but King Eiders and Long-tailed Ducks have declined markedly. The results support previous findings that the Rasmussen Lowlands is a critical breeding and summer area for Greater White-fronted Geese and other arctic-nesting waterfowl, and further strengthen the recommendations that this site should be protected."
630,2595,Divergent responses of Pygoscelis penguins reveal a common environmental driver,"The responses of predators to environmental variability in the Antarctic Peninsula region have exhibited divergent patterns owing to variation in the geographic settings of colonies and predator life-history strategies. Five breeding colonies of Pygoscelis penguins from King George Island and Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, were examined to (1) compare the responses of sympatric congeners to recent changes in their Antarctic ecosystem and (2) assess underlying causes for such responses. We used linear regression and correlation analyses to compare indices of abundance, recruitment, and summer breeding performance of the Adélie (P. adeliae), gentoo (P. papua), and chinstrap penguins (P. antarctica). Breeding colonies of Adélie and chinstrap penguins have declined by roughly 50% since the mid-1970s, and recruitment indices of Adélie penguins have declined by roughly 80%, but no such patterns are evident for gentoo penguins. Fledging success, however, has remained stable at all breeding colonies. The different trends in abundance and recruitment indices for each species, despite generally similar indices of summer performance, suggest that winter conditions contribute to the divergent responses among the penguins. In particular, strong correlations between indices of penguin and krill recruitment suggest that penguins in the South Shetland Islands may live under an increasingly krill-limited system that has disproportionate effects on the survival of juvenile birds. "
631,2431,Effect of cyclic and declining food supply on great grey owls in boreal Sweden,"In this study of 35 years of data, we examine the short-term (cyclic) and long-term relationship between breeding success of great grey owls (Strix nebulosa Forster, 1772) and their food supply (bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus (Schreber, 1780)), grey-sided voles (Clethrionomys rufocanus (Sundevall, 1846)), and field voles (Microtus agrestis (L., 1761))) in northern Sweden. Annual number of owl nests showed a 3 year cyclicity, which as predicted, corresponded to the length of the vole cycle in the region. Mean annual brood size also fluctuated and was positively dependent on the vole supply during the same spring. In this region, there has also been a decline in vole numbers in recent decades, from high-amplitude cycles in the 1970s to subsequent low-amplitude cycles. Correspondingly, and as predicted, mean annual brood size of the owls also declined, although only during the third years of the vole cycle when vole supply in spring and brood size of the owls is at its highest level in high-amplitude cycles. We predict that in the long run the vole decline, associated with increasingly milder winters, and the reduction of the brood size of the owls, especially in years of high owl breeding success, will have serious implications for the population of great grey owls in Scandinavia."
632,4156,Relative abundance trend of the blue shark Prionace glauca based on Japanese distant-water and offshore longliner activity in the North Pacific,"The KuroshioOyashio transition zone is one of the most important fishing grounds for pelagic fish, including blue shark and swordfish, which are primarily targeted by shallower Japanese longliners. We evaluated the fishing behavior of Japanese longliners based at the Kesennuma fishing port to estimate the standardized catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of blue shark. In our analysis, we first used data that had been filtered for blue shark sets and found that annual target shifts occurred seasonally and geographically; the greatest change in target species, from swordfish to blue shark, occurred in spring (AprilJune). Beginning in the early 1990s, the fishing grounds shifted from the southwest to the northeast of the North Pacific, and the number of sets targeting blue shark gradually increased. To incorporate this variable target behavior into the abundance index, the 10th percentile of the swordfish CPUE values was applied as the target indicator in the CPUE standardization model. The results indicate an upward population trend that has been caused by a decrease in fishing pressure from the early 1990s due to the prohibition of drift nets in 1992 and the subsequent decrease in longline vessels."
633,3743,Snares crested penguins Eudyptes robustus population estimates 2000–2013,"New Zealand (NZ) is an internationally significant area for penguins. All NZ penguin species are listed in ‘at risk’ threat categories. The naturally uncommon Snares crested penguins (Eudyptes robustus), which are restricted to NZ subantarctic islands, are highly susceptible to localised stochastic events and human activities. There has been uncertainty about population size and trends for Snares crested penguins. We surveyed the nest abundance and distribution of Snares crested penguins on Northeast (NE) and Broughton Islands, Snares Island group, from late September to early October in 2008, 2010 and 2013 and compared results with a survey from 2000. Counts of all nests (nests with eggs and total observed nests) within all colonies around the islands were undertaken. In 2008, 19 845 ± 29 nests with eggs and 24 666 ± 38 total nests were counted from 111 colonies. In 2010, 25 525 ± 21 nests with eggs and 30 672 ± 26 total nests from 117 colonies were counted while in 2013, 25 149 ± 39 nests with eggs and 29 009 ± 45 total nests from 119 colonies were counted. Penguin nest numbers at the Snares appear to be stable overall when compared with the 2000 survey, which gave 28 396 nests with eggs (direct counts) and 30 607 total nests from 112 colonies. However, 2008 appears to be a year with considerably lower numbers of nests compared with other years. This apparently stable population is in contrast to most other crested penguins in the world. Given the extremely restricted distribution of Snares crested penguins and potential for a rapid catastrophic decline, we recommend surveys be continued at regular intervals in order to detect a significant decline and allow management measures to be implemented if needed."
634,853,Diagnosing a shorebird local population decline with a stage-structured population model,"The breeding population of Semipalmated Sandpipers at La Perouse Bay, Churchill, Manitoba declined sharply during the 1980s. Using demographic information collected during eight summers of field work we built a stochastic matrix population model. The model successfully reconstructed the observed decline in the population during the course of the study. The predictions of the model agreed with the observed population level in 1993, 5 yr after the study was completed. Sensitivity analysis showed that the population trend was most sensitive to changes in adult survivorship and to immigration of adults onto the site. We ran simulations to consider five possible reasons for the decline: (1) low adult survivorship, (2) low fecundity, (3) delayed recruitment into the population, (4) low juvenile survivorship, and (5) insufficient immigration. For biologically reasonable values of these parameters, only adult survivorship and immigration rates could account for the observed decline, although juvenile survival also had some impact. These simulations also illustrate that sensitivity is a complex function of the demographic variables, and in particular, sensitivity to adult survival varies across the range of adult survival values that we considered. In addition, we used the model to explore the influence of annual variability in demographic parameters. It is known that the general effect of annual variation is to depress population trends. We showed that the sensitivity of the model to annual variability in survival is tied to the sensitivity of the model to changes in mean values of survival. With the empirical parameter values from this local population, we found that, when survival is high enough to promote stability of the population, the population is highly sensitive to the level of survival, and also to the amount of annual variability in survival. By contrast, the model is not very sensitive to fecundity and is correspondingly insensitive to annual variation in fecundity."
635,2972,"Population Status and Internesting Movement of Leatherback Turtles, Dermochelys coriacea, Nesting on the Northwest Coast of Papua, Indonesia","The northwest coast of the province of Papua in Indonesia is thought to host the largest remaining leatherback nesting population in the Pacific Ocean. We conducted a census of nesting activity at Jamursba-Medi from 2001 through 2004 and of Wermon from 2002 to 2004, and tracked internesting movements of female leatherbacks by using satellite telemetry during the nesting season in 2003. We recorded 1865-3601 nests each season at Jamursba-Medi and 1788-2881 nests at Wermon. Nesting occurred year-round, with a peak in activity between May and September at Jamursba-Medi, and between October and March at Wermon. Comparing these data with previous records of nesting activity from 1981 to 2001 indicates that, although there are indications of a long-term decline, this population has not been depleted to the extent found at other major rookeries in the Pacific. Satellite telemetry indicates that nesters frequent waters around the Raja Ampat Islands and coastal waters to the west of Jamursba-Medi, and may also nest outside the monitored area. We recommend establishing a marine protected area to ensure protection of this population in these critical nearshore marine habitats and implementation of conservation measures in partnership with local communities at these nesting beaches before this population becomes depleted.

636,1908,"Avoiding aliens: Behavioural plasticity in habitat use enables large, nocturnal geckos to survive Pacific rat invasions","Rodents are efficient invaders on a global scale and pose a significant threat to native biotas, particularly in systems such as oceanic islands which support a reduced suite of mammals. Pacific rats (Rattus exulans) are implicated in extinctions, range restrictions and declines of vulnerable endemic faunas throughout the Pacific. However, research into the behavioural and ecological modifications that enable native species to persist in the presence of Pacific rats is scant. We examined the population structure, behaviour and microhabitat use of Duvaucel's geckos (Hoplodactylus duvauceiii; radio-telemetry), and Pacific rats (spool-and-line tracking) on three New Zealand offshore islands with different histories of rat incursions and eradication: (1) Green island, historically rat-free, (2) Korapuki, from which rats were eradicated 20 years ago, and (3) Ohinau, before and 6 months after rat eradication. Although Pacific rats and Duvaucel's geckos shared habitat at a broad spatial scale, little overlap in micro-habitat use existed where they were sympatric. In the presence of rats, Duvaucel's gecko capture rates and recruitment were reduced. However, 6 months after rat eradication, and prior to any recruitment, capture rates of adult geckos increased fourfold and geckos were using a greater proportion of habitat preferred by rats. Thus, we provide strong empirical evidence that Pacific rats ecologically displace Duvaucel's geckos. Highly plastic spatial avoidance behaviour by native prey species in response to the presence of introduced rodents may enable geckos to persist in sympatry with rodents at least in the short-term. "
637,1892,"Problems in the harvest of edible birds' nests in Sarawak and Sabah, Malaysian Borneo","Due to the value of their nests, there is great pressure on the populations of black-nest swiftlets (Collocalia maximus) and white-nest swiftlets (Collocalia fuciphagus) in the Malaysian provinces of Sarawak and Sabah. The problems are particularly acute at Gunung Mulu National Park, in spite of a complete ban on collection there, and at Niah National Park, where every participant in a complex collection and trading system has an incentive to take more nests than permitted. More successful harvest systems function in Sabah's Gomantong and Madai Caves. Recommendations for improved management of the nest harvest include addressing corruption, ensuring that local people with traditional rights to collect nests do not lose income to illegal immigrant labor and to traders, improving research and education about the swiftlets' behavior and ecology, and moving value-added processing of the nests closer to the caves where they originate and to the people who collect them."
638,4473,"Population structure of the sicklefin lemon shark Negaprion acutidens within the Curieuse Marine National Park, Seychelles","This study produced the first data on population parameters for sicklefin lemon shark Negaprion acutidens at the granitic Seychelles Islands, adding to a limited catalogue of species information. Juveniles at a site in the Curieuse Marine National Park were tagged over two periods, in 2014–2015 and 2015–2016, with measurements of length (precaudal, fork and total) and weight, sex, and state of the umbilical opening recorded. Recapture data were used to calculate growth rates and population size. Mean annual growth rate was 5.40 cm y–1. A mean size at birth of 62.5 cm TL is in line with previous assessments of the species. Population-size estimates were similar for the two sampling periods (comprising 311 and 255 individuals) and higher than anticipated. Movements to outside the lagoon were recorded for early ages, and this, combined with weight loss and a reduction in condition factor as displayed in several individuals, suggests that the study area alone could not support the large number of sharks pupped yearly."
639,2868,"Estimating population size, structure, and residency time for whale sharks Rhincodon typus through collaborative photo-identification","Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data from Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP) in Western Australia have recently been used to study the population dynamics of the local whale shark aggregation. Because nascent research efforts at other aggregation points look to NMP as a model, further analysis of existing modeling approaches is important. We have expanded upon previous studies of NMP whale sharks by estimating CMR survival and recruitment rates as functions of average total length (TL). Our analysis suggests a decline in reported values of TL coincident with marginally increasing abundance among sharks sighted in more than one year ('returning') from 1995 to 2008. We found a positive, average returning recruitment rate (e) of 1.07 yr[long dash]1 (0.99 to 1.15, 95% CI); smaller individuals contributed in larger numbers to recruitment, allowing for population growth accompanied by a decline in median size. We subsequently explored intraseasonal population dynamics with the Open Robust Design (ORD) model structure. Our best-fit model estimated modestly increasing annual abundances between 107 (95% CI = 90 to 124) and 159 (95% CI = 127 to 190) for 2004 to 2007, suggesting a short-term increase in total annual abundance. The ORD also estimated an average residency time of 33 d (95% CI = 31 to 39) and biweekly entry profiles into the study area. Overall, our techniques demonstrate how large aggregations of the species can be modeled to better understand short- and long-term population trends. These results also show the direct scientific benefit from the development of an online, collaborative data management system to increase collection of sighting data for a rare species in conjunction with ecotourism activity."
640,3008,"Declining trends in annual catch rates of the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) in Queensland, Australia","Suitable long term species-specific catch rate and biological data are seldom available for large shark; species, particularly where historical commercial logbook reporting has been poor. However, shark control; programs can provide suitable data from gear that consistently fishes nearshore waters all year; round. We present an analysis of the distribution of 4757 Galeocerdo cuvier caught in surface nets and on; drumlines across 9 of the 10 locations of the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) between 1993; and 2010. Standardised catch rates showed a significant decline (p < 0.0001) in southern Queensland; locations for both gear types, which contrasts with studies at other locations where increases in tiger; shark catch per unit effort (CPUE) have been reported. Significant temporal declines in the average size of; tiger sharks occurred at four of the nine locations analysed (p < 0.05), which may be indicative of fishing; reducing abundance in these areas. Given the long term nature of shark control programs along the Australian; east coast, effects on local abundance should have been evident many years ago, which suggests; that factors other than the effects of shark control programs have also contributed to the decline. While; reductions in catch rate are consistent with a decline in tiger shark abundance, this interpretation should; be made with caution, as the inter-annual CPUE varies considerably at most locations. Nevertheless, the; overall downward trend, particularly in southern Queensland, indicates that current fishing pressures on; the species may be unsustainable."
641,2102,"Pelagic shark fisheries along the west coast of the United States and Baja California, Mexico","Fisheries targeting elasmobranch resources have experienced a dramatic growth during the past two decades. World-wide elasmobranch landings exceed 600 000 metric tons (mt) annually and have clearly made a significant impact on portions of that resource. In the eastern north Pacific catches of common thresher, shortfin mako and blue sharks may exceed 15 000 mt annually. Nearly 90% of all sharks taken within this area are immature. Like most sharks, these pelagics have low rates of increase which make them quite vulnerable to modern day fishing pressure. Clearly, the removal of large segments of juveniles from any population has the potential to decrease the adult population to unsustainable levels. The ability of populations to recover from over-exploitation depends not only on initial stock size, natural mortality, and migration rates, but also upon reducing total fishing mortality. Regulations enacted by special interest groups benefiting only one segment of the resource users, combined with the lack of biological information, have slowed progress towards achieving rational management."
642,4415,"Ecology of Olive Ridley Sea Turtles at Arribadas at Playa La Flor, Nicaragua","Playa La Flor in Nicaragua is one of the few remaining beaches where Olive Ridley Sea Turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) nest in arribadas. In this study, we present data on the status of the nesting population of L. olivacea on Playa La Flor from 1998 to 2006. Furthermore, in 2004 we established six plots (6 m × 6 m) on a 400-m section of the nesting beach to measure the levels of illegal egg take, clutch hatching success, and hatchling production. The total number of turtles nesting at Playa La Flor increased from 1998 to 2006 where arribadas ranged in size from 167 to 60,816 turtle encounters. In August 2004, 45% of the clutches laid during the arribada were taken illegally from the study plots, whereas these levels were lower during the arribadas occurring from September to November. In 2004, clutch hatching success and hatchling production were higher in plots located high on the beach compared with plots that were closer to or below the high-tide line. Clutch hatching success and hatchling production were higher in the September arribada than during other arribadas within the same year. The lower hatching success and hatchling production of nests laid during later arribadas might be explained by increased nest density, and overlapping clutches in the study plots could lead to an increase in microbial load, O2 demand, and CO2 production. If manipulating clutches is warranted on Playa La Flor, managers should target clutches that are at the highest risk of drowning, are in areas of high nest density, and are deposited during the larger arribadas that occur later in the nesting season. The location of clutches to be moved/removed might change between years, even on the same beach."
643,3704,"Environmental predictors and temporal patterns of basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) occurence in the lower Bay of Fundy, Canada","Little is currently known about the population dynamics of basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) at regional or local scales. Using a long-termsighting database (19942012) and photo-identification of individuals,we studied the seasonal and inter-annual patterns in basking shark occurrence and site fidelity in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Zero-inflated negative binomial models quantified spatial, temporal and environmental predictors of shark sighting rates. The probability of sighting a basking shark increased in August, and in deep water offshore; this may reflect the distribution and availability of calanoid copepod prey. Sea-surface temperature (SST) had no effects on shark sightings, but there was a negative correlation between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and shark sightings lagged at two and four years; the former possibly due to the position of the Gulf Stream and the latter likely a result of the lagged influence of the NAO on copepod abundance. The model also showed a significant decline in the occurrence of basking sharks within the Bay of Fundy over the study period. From unique markings on dorsal fins, 98 individual sharks were identified from photographs taken between 1997 and 2012. Four of these individuals were re-sighted in subsequent years, and the longest interval between re-sightings was 9.1 years. These re-sightings suggest some site fidelity by individuals and demonstrate the longevity of some mark-types on the first dorsal fin. This study highlights the role of long-termsightings and photographic records as population assessment tools for regional scale-monitoring of a globally vulnerable species."
644,1505,Fluctuations in distribution and patterns of individual range use of northern bottlenose whales.,"This study investigated the pattern and scale of distribution, movements and range use of the northern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon arnpullatus above a submarine canyon, the Gully, off eastern Canada between 1988 and 1998. Locations and individual identification photographs were collected during encounters with whales. Whales showed a discrete distribution within the canyon associated with water depth (500 to 1500 m) and relatively steep topography. Encounter rate and distribution showed some variation between years. Changes in distribution were observed toward the north or south of the canyon, probably a consequence of changes in prey distribution. Individual whales within the canyon displaced 4 to 5 km over 24 h, with negligible further increase in displacement over time scales up to 20 d (their approximate residency period). Short-term VHF radio-tracking of 5 individuals provided an independent source of movement data, showing displacements of approximately 2 km in 1 h and 5 to 10 km in 1 d. The relative lack of movement observed for these whales supports the hypothesis that the canyon contains a profitable and localized food source. Movements of whales best fit a model of short-term residence within ranges of approximately 25 km2, although the range size of mature males was smaller than that of females and immature males. Photo-resightings were also used to investigate variation in the positions of individual whales within the Gully. Within years, individuals showed some separation of ranges associated with periods of high whale abundance, but there was no separation between different age-sex classes. Between years, mature males showed consistent spatial orientations relative to each other, suggesting preferred locations possibly related to mating opportunities."
645,3816,Evaluating the benefit of captive breeding and reintroductions to endangered Sonoran pronghorn,"Sonoran pronghorn (Antilocapra americana sonoriensis), an endangered subspecies of American pronghorn, are of great conservation concern in the southwestern U. S. Following a dramatic population decline in 2002, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) began a captive breeding program that has subsequently been used to supplement the wild population. Additionally, in 2009 the USFWS proposed to establish another, self-sustaining population outside of their range at that time. We modeled Sonoran pronghorn population dynamics based on time-series of abundance and conducted a population viability analysis (PVA) to evaluate the benefit of these management actions. We found that rates of change in the Sonoran pronghorn population were closely tied to the amount of precipitation in the area but that viability was greatly enhanced by conservation actions including the maintenance of a captive population, as well as the establishment of two additional populations outside the current range."

The population fluctuations in time in northern Sweden are examined for the following species: voles, mountain hare, willow grouse, black grouse, capercaillie, hazel hen, red fox, long-eared owl, Tengmalm's owl, and tularemia. Necessary population data have been obtained from the period 1963-1975/76 as revealed by catches, literature survey, hunting statistics, bird ringing, and obligatory reporting of tularemia in man. 2. The populations of the species under consideration are found to fluctuate synchronously in time and show a 3- or 4-year cycle for the period 1963-1975. Population peaks have occurred in connection with the peak densities of voles in the winters 1963-1964, 1966-1967, 1969-1970 and 1973-1974. 3. Voles caused extensive forest damage (mainly bark-eating) in at least the latter three peak winters. From consideration of the available literature it is apparent that bark is a marginal food. Thus, increased bark-eating during peak densities of voles in winter should be interpreted as a shortage of preferred food. 4. The species studied appear to form a unit (subsystem) within the boreal forest ecosystem. This idea is supported by the connecting predatorprey relationships and the demonstrated synchronous population fluctuations. The subsystem contains herbivores, their food vegetation, and predators. Tularemia is regarded as only one among other predators on voles and mountain hares. 5. It is postulated that voles play a central role in causing the overall synchronism in the population fluctuations of the subsystem. 6. The synchronous population fluctuations described can be explained by the following model for their regulation: a) An initial decline in vole numbers is brought about by food shortage at winter peak densities. b) Predator populations (built up with the help of the rich supply of voles) cooperate with food shortage and at some critical point predators alone are able to fulfil the decrease in vole numbers. c) Because of the decrease in vole numbers the predators are forced into a decline themselves and must turn to alternative prey species. Mountain hare and gamebird populations represent a low biomass compared with vole populations and predation thus causes the decline in numbers of these small game. d) Low numbers of predators and excessive food supply then allow voles, mountain hares, and gamebirds to increase again. e) The building up of vole populations sets the stage for another increase in the number of predators and a new cycle is started.

647,3159,Populatietrends van overwinterende en doortrekkende watervogels in Nederland in 1975-2010,"Despite its small size, The Netherlands support large numbers of waterbirds and are an important cross-road of migration routes within Europe. Its large wetlands and highly productive agricultural landscape attract up to five million waterbirds, of which two million geese. Of several species (e.g. Bewick's Swan, Pink-footed Goose, Greater White-fronted Goose, Barnacle Goose, Red Knot) this involves major parts of the flyway populations. Waterbird surveys, involving many volunteer observers, have a long history in The Netherlands and nowadays are part of a national governmental monitoring scheme. They consist of monthly counts in the relevant parts of the year and main sites, augmented by a midwinter count covering much of the remaining wetlands and agricultural areas (Tab.1). Usually counts are carried out during daytime on the feeding grounds, but as several areas were designated as Natura 2000 sites for roosting birds, counts of night-roosts have recently been established as well. In some species (e.g. Great White Egret) roost counts provide better estimates of the wintering population than counts of foraging areas during daytime. This paper summarises 35 years of waterbird counts in The Netherlands. A major part of this period was characterised by exceptionally mild winters (Fig. 1), partly in a long row which only recently was broken. Table 3 summarises by species the observed trends (in seasonal averages, i.e. the sum of all annual counts divided by 12) over the past 30 and 10 years, and counted as well as estimated seasonal peak numbers and the month(s) in which they occur. The latter include numbers imputed for missing counts and estimates for non-counted areas. Waterbird numbers in The Netherlands showed a twofold increase in the past 30 years, with most rapid increases in the 1990s and around 2000 (Fig. 9). Several goose species, Mute Swan and Great Cormorant dominate this increase, whereas ducks only slightly increased and waders fluctuated without a clear common trend. During the past decade, 31% of the species were still increasing, whereas 25% declined and 25% were stable. Among the species with the most rapid increases are Greater Canada Goose (Fig. 2), Egyptian Goose, Great White Egret, Red-crested Pochard and Slavonian Grebe. Steepest declines occurred in Taiga Bean Goose, Common Eider, Common Scoter, Bewick's Swan, Ruff and Kentish Plover. Drivers of the observed population are diverse. In a number of species, changes in The Netherlands suggests an impact of warming (winter) climate (declines in e.g. Taiga Bean Goose, Mallard, Common Pochard, Greater Scaup, Smew, Goosander; increases in e.g. Northern Shoveler and Grey Plover). In other species, breeding success in artic breeding areas decreased, leading to lower numbers in e.g. Bewick's Swan and Dark-bellied Brent Goose. Breeding success in Tundra Bean Goose and Greater-White-fronted Goose also declined in the past decade, but so far this has not resulted in lower numbers in The Netherlands. Particularly in geese, numbers observed in The Netherlands also rely on conditions elsewhere in the flyway as they easily switch between wintering and stop-over sites in NW-Europe, as it is observed in Pink-footed Goose (recent increase in Denmark and decline in The Netherlands) and Tundra Bean Goose (influx in The Netherlands during cold winters)."
648,4140,Population trend and conservation status of the Capricorn Yellow Chat Epthianura crocea macgregori,"The average population size of Capricorn Yellow Chat Epthianura crocea macgregori was estimated at 251 +/-31 (SE) by repeated surveys over seven years (20042010) using consistent search effort at known occupied sites. Because the survey period coincided with a mixture of dry and wet years (drought from 2004 to 2007 followed by flood rainfall in early 2008 and 2010), it is particularly valuable as a preliminary benchmark upon which to base management decisions. Most of the population (74.5%) was in the Broad Sound area in the north, with lower numbers in the Fitzroy River delta area in the south (22%) and at Curtis Island (3.5%). Sites on Torilla Plain in Broad Sound accounted for two-thirds of the estimated population, making it a priority for conservation efforts. Depending on habitat configuration, some Capricorn Yellow Chats showed a seasonal pattern of habitat use, moving from flooded breeding habitats as they dried to refuge sites such as salt fields or upper marine plains in the dry season; distances moved being &lt; 10 km. Standard surveys from Torilla Plain showed that the chat count during a sequence of above-average rainfall years was almost double that of the average for drought years: 162 +/-28 (20082015) compared with 85 +/-15 (20042007) respectively. Low population size, large annual fluctuations in population with prior rainfall, rapid declines in low rainfall years, a fragmented distribution and almost half the population concentrated at one site point to a subspecies vulnerable to chance events. Increased climatic extremes predicted by climate change such as higher temperatures, evaporation rates, extended droughts and more intense rainfall events add to its vulnerability."
649,1666,Stormy oceans are associated with sea turtle hatching declines,"Many sea turtle populations are below 10% of their pre-Columbian numbers [1-4]. Though historic and systematic over-exploitation is the principal cause of these declines, sea turtles face similar threats today. Adults and juveniles are actively hunted and commercial fisheries catch them incidentally. Nesting suffers from beach development, egg poaching and the poaching of nesting females. Accompanying these familiar hazards is the largely unknown consequences of recent climate change. Here we report monitoring surveys from the Dry Tortugas National Park (DTNP, 24.64N 82.86W), Florida, and show that hurricanes and other storm events are an additional and increasing threat to loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) and green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) nesting. Both species are listed by the US Endangered Species Act and the IUCN considers them 'endangered'. "
650,2106,"Dynamics of a protected black rhino (Diceros bicornis) population: Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa","Achieving maximum productivity in remnant populations of black rhinoceros is crucial to the persistence of this species. It was, therefore, investigated whether the black rhino population of Pilanesberg National Park had become regulated by resource limitation 22 years after introduction in 1979. Inter-calving intervals (which are not restricted to yearly time increments, due to asynchronous reproduction) decreased with an increase in rainfall, while the percentage of male calves born increased with increasing rainfall. The percentage of reproductive cows achieving maternal success increased with increasing density until 0.085 rhinos/km2, after which it decreased. This positive relationship at low densities is largely due to changes in the female age structure and the adult female/male ratio. The age at first calving tended to increase with increasing density, while mortality was not related to rainfall or density. It is concluded that the Pilanesberg black rhino population is showing the first signs of density dependence. It is proposed that black rhino conservators should monitor the percentage of cows achieving maternal success to detect early indications of density dependent resource limitation and use this as a criteria for decisions regarding metapopulation management."
651,2101,"Geographical distribution and abundance of Pacific saury, Cololabis saira (Brevoort) (Scomberesocidae), fishing stocks in the northwestern Pacific in relation to sea temperatures","We compared geographical distributions of Pacific saury, Cololabis saira (Brevoort) (Scomberesocidae), fishing stocks in the Northwest Pacific (NWP) for 3 yearly groups of high, average, and low abundances, using the Taiwanese fishery catch per unit effort (CPUE) data from 1994 to 2002. Two migratory groups, inshore and offshore, were found in average- and low-abundance years, while an additional oceanic migratory group, which spread eastward to around 178[degree]E in Oct., was found in the year of high abundance. Most of the saury groups were distributed in areas where the sea surface temperature (SST) ranged between 10 and 20[degree]C with a high aggregation around 15[degree]C, implying that 15[degree]C is the preferred temperature for saury to aggregate intensively for the commencement of the spawning migration, and to move southward to spawning grounds where SSTs of around 20[degree]C are favorable to their offspring. The timing, abundance, and geographical distributions of fish aggregations of migratory saury were associated with SSTs. In the early stages of the fishing season, apparent warming caused by the intrusion of Kuroshio Current waters in the southern NWP was closely related to delayed aggregation and low abundances of the saury stock; in contrast, cooling of the waters affected by Oyashio waters was related to eastward aggregation and high abundances of saury. High saury abundances occurred in low-temperature areas. Specifically, in years of low CPUE values, sea water temperatures (SWTs) of the fishing grounds were higher than 15[degree]C, while in years of average and high CPUE values, the SWTs of the fishing grounds were < 15[degree]C. Therefore, fishing ground SWTs higher than 15[degree]C (around 16[degree]C SST) is an indicator of low stock abundances of saury in the NWP."
652,3091,Shorebird use of an exposed sandy beach in southern California,"Frequent morning surveys of birds were conducted on 1 km of beach in southern California to investigate shorebird use of an; exposed sandy beach. The overall mean abundance (98.6 individualskm1), estimated biomass (9.6 kgkm1), and species richness; (5.5 specieskm1) of shorebirds observed were very high for a sandy beach in the temperate zone. Eight species, sanderling (Calidris; alba), semipalmated plover (Charadrius semipalmatus), marbled godwit (Limosa fedoa), black-bellied plover (Pluvialis squatarola),; western sandpiper (Calidris mauri), willet (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus), surfbird (Aphriza virgata), and whimbrel (Numenius; phaeopus), occurred in overall mean abundances >1 birdkm1 and accounted for 97% of the abundance and biomass of shorebirds.; Sanderlings were the most abundant shorebird every year (64% of individuals and 35% of the biomass). Different species of; abundant shorebirds exhibited distinct patterns of use of beach habitat, including fall, spring, and winter peaks in abundance.; Temporal variation in shorebird use on seasonal and interannual scales was associated with migration patterns, and also with; habitat availability and condition. Seasonal variation in monthly mean abundance and estimated biomass of shorebirds varied over; more than an order of magnitude and followed a similar pattern in each year, reaching maxima in the fall or winter (161; 280 individualskm1 and 15.423.9 kgkm1) and minima in May or June (311 individualskm1 and 0.82.2 kgkm1). A minor; peak in shorebird abundance and biomass coinciding with spring migration was observed in April of most years. The number of; species of shorebirds observed in individual surveys ranged from 0 to 11 specieskm1 and was positively and significantly correlated; with abundance. Monthly mean species richness and the total species observed monthly followed similar seasonal patterns, ranging; from annual maxima of 7.49.1 and 1217 specieskm1 between August and October to minima of 0.82.1 and 28 specieskm1,; respectively, during June. In contrast, species turnover was lowest (1.11.7) in October and November, and generally highest (24); during early summer (June). The amount of sandy intertidal habitat available to shorebirds on the transect was estimated using sand; elevations and predicted tide heights. In the fall and winter, the abundance of shorebirds was significantly and positively correlated; with tide height, possibly reflecting feeding opportunities and high tide refuge effects during the highest tides. In the spring when; sand levels were low, the abundance of shorebirds was negatively correlated with tide height. Prey availability, beach condition and; the local availability, and condition of alternative foraging habitats may influence those relationships. Interannual variations in; shorebird use and beach condition were observed in the course of the study. During an El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event; (19971998), the extent of sandy habitat was greatly reduced and intertidal habitat was mostly converted to rocky substrate. The; overall abundance of shorebirds and the mean abundance of some common species (e.g. sanderling) were depressed, and an; uncommon species (surfbird, A. virgata) was unusually abundant during the ENSO event. In summary, the results suggest that; sandy beaches are important habitat for many species of shorebirds, particularly in areas where alternative coastal foraging habitats,; such as coastal wetlands, have become scarce. Understanding the dynamics of and threats to exposed sandy beaches may be; increasingly important for shorebird conservation in many coastal regions."
653,4452,Dynamics and genetics of a disease driven species decline to near extinction: lessons for conservation,"Amphibian chytridiomycosis has caused precipitous declines in hundreds of species worldwide. By tracking mountain chicken (Leptodactylus fallax) populations before, during and after the emergence of chytridiomycosis, we quantified the real-time species level impacts of this disease. We report a range-wide species decline amongst the fastest ever recorded, with a loss of over 85% of the population in fewer than 18 months on Dominica and near extinction on Montserrat. Genetic diversity declined in the wild, but emergency measures to establish a captive assurance population captured a representative sample of genetic diversity from Montserrat. If the Convention on Biological Diversity's targets are to be met, it is important to evaluate the reasons why they appear consistently unattainable. The emergence of chytridiomycosis in the mountain chicken was predictable, but the decline could not be prevented. There is an urgent need to build mitigation capacity where amphibians are at risk from chytridiomycosis."
654,1640,Regulation and Stability of a Free-Living Host-Parasite System: Trichostrongylus tenuis in Red Grouse. I. Monitoring and Parasite Reduction Experiments,"Intensive population studies were conducted for 10 yr on Lagopus lagopus scoticus and the parasitic nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis in N England. Winter loss was the key factor determining changes in grouse numbers, although breeding losses were also important. T. tenuis had an aggregated distribution within the adult grouse population, even though the degree of aggregation was relatively low compared with other parasite systems. Recruitment of parasites into the adult worm population was dependent on grouse density. Both winter loss and breeding losses were correlated with intensity of parasite infection. Experimental reduction in parasite burdens consistently increased breeding production and winter survival of grouse. The red grouse-T. tenuis system exhibits three conditions that will generate population cycles: 1) parasite-induced reduction in grouse breeding production; 2) a low degree of parasite aggregation within the grouse population; and 3) time delays in parasite recruitment. -from Authors"
655,1770,"Cats and seabirds: effects of feral Domestic Cat Felis silvestris catus eradication on the population of Sooty Terns Onychoprion fuscata on Ascension Island, South Atlantic","The population of Sooty Terns Onychoprion fuscata breeding on Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean was monitored over 17 years (1990-2007). This period spanned the programme of feral Domestic Cat Felis silvestris catus eradication from the island, which commenced in 2001 with the last Cat recorded in 2004. We report on the abundance of Sooty Terns and Black Rats Rattus rattus before and after Cat eradication. The Sooty Tern breeding population in the 1990s averaged 368 000 and Cats were killing Terns at an average rate of 33 adults per night. Following Cat eradication, adult Terns are no longer predated. However, egg predation by both Rats and Common Mynas Acridotheres tristis has continued with Mynas destroying more eggs than Rats. Unexpectedly, we observed a change in Rat predatory behaviour. Following Cat eradication, Rats have become a major predator of Sooty Tern chicks. Despite this change, the Tern population has shown a season-on-season increase since Cat eradication, 48.8% in 2005, 8.2% in 2006 and 6.1% in 2007, and the breeding population increased to 420 000 birds in 2007. Incubation success improved from 66.0 to 84.4% during Cat eradication, before dropping down again to 67.9% after Cats were eradicated and Rat control measures were introduced. Index traplines were set for Rats and Rat numbers fluctuated widely immediately after Cats were eradicated but there were no significant differences that could be attributed to changes in Cat numbers. Ascension Island Sooty Terns breed every 9.6 months and juveniles defer breeding for seven seasons. Hence 2008 is the first year in which an increase in the breeding Sooty Tern population directly attributable to Cat eradication is likely to be detected. We conclude that long-term monitoring is essential to guide conservation practice even in this relatively simple predator-prey system. "
656,1469,"Effects of winter fishery activities on resting numbers, food and body condition of large gulls Larus argentatus and L. marinus in the south-eastern North Sea.","C Influences of fishery activities on herring gulls and great black-backed gulls (Larus argentatus, L. marinus) wintering on the island of Helgoland, south-eastern North Sea, were studied. When cod fishery discards were available close to the island, 83 to 87% of the gulls' pellets contained fishery discard remains and 70 to 73% of all pellets consisted exclusively of these. At times when no nearby trawling took place (Christmas/New Year), numbers of herring gulls dropped by up to 86% and numbers of great black-backed gulls by up to 80%. Similar declines were observed during a trawling moratorium in February 1998. Adults of both gull species had a significantly lower body mass during periods of no fishing around the island (13 and 24% less, respectively). Retraps of single gulls support these findings. The results show for the first time a strong influence of discard availability on numbers and body condition of large gulls wintering in the south-eastern North Sea. Effects on gull winter mortality and thus on population dynamics can be assumed."
657,2116,Interannual and long-term variation in the nearshore fish community of the mesohaline Hudson river estuary,"The detection of long-term shifts in species composition and spatial structuring of aquatic communities may be obscured by high levels of interannual variation. Estuarine fish communities are likely to exhibit high levels of variation owing to the influence of riverine forcing and the importance of anadromous and transient species, whose abundances may not be locally controlled. We describe patterns of interannual variation and long-term shifts in the nearshore fish community of the mesohaline Hudson River estuary based on 21 yr of beach seine sampling conducted annually between late August and mid November. Of the 60 species encountered, the most abundant were Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia), striped bass (Marone saxatilis), white perch (Morone americana), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis). Relationships between annual community composition and seasonal flow and temperature regimes were examined with canonical correspondence analysis. Annual variation was most closely correlated with river flows in the 3-mo period preceding fish sampling, indicating a persistent effect of environmental conditions on community structure. Despite significant interannual variation in composition, longer-term trends in community structure were observed. These included declines in catch rates of freshwater and estuarine species and a dramatic increase in the catch of Atlantic silversides, an annual marine species. Associated with these changes were declines in community diversity and increased compositional variation. These results indicate that analyses of temporal changes in community structure need to account for the multiple time scales under which forcing factors and community composition vary."
658,596,"Reproductive Success, Hatchling Survival and Rate of Increase of Gharial Gavialis gangeticus in National Chambal Sanctuary, India.","The gharial Gavialis gangeticus Gmelin is endemic to the Indian subcontinent and was on the verge of extinction in India by the mid-1970's. As a conservation measure, since 1979 captive reared gharials have been reintroduced in several protected areas. The reproductive success and hatchling survival in one of these managed populations was determined by monitoring 124 nests between 1987 and 1989. Population rate of increase in a 425 km stretch of the Chambal River, National Chambal Sanctuary, was determined by surveys every alternate year between 1988 and 1992. The mean clutch size (36.51 ± 0.65 eggs) showed no significant variation between years (ANOVA, F=0.821, p=0.443). Number of infertile eggs per clutch was (2.99 ± 0.160) and no significant difference in the mean number of infertile eggs per nest was found between years (ANOVA, F=0.534, p=0.588). The overall fertility was 91.8%. and it did not vary among years (ANOVA, F=0.075, p=0.927). A substantial number of eggs (32.1%) were lost between egg laying and hatching, largely due to eggs being damaged during nest searches, predation, desiccation and unknown reasons. Predation losses increased between 1987 and 1989, and varied significantly between years (ANOVA, F=3.970, p=0.021). During the study period the overall hatching success was 67.9%. Mean recruitment of 1-year old to the population was 7.7, 8.8 in 1987-1988 and 6.6% in 1989-1990. This indicates 92.3% hatchling mortality within the first year. The egg to post monsoon survivorship was 6.6% in 1987-1988 and 4.3% in 1989-1990, with a mean of 5.5% during the study period. The density of gharial increased from 1.93 gharial/river km in 1988 to 2.52 during 1992. The overall exponential rate of increase in the population was 0.179 (p=0.012) or equivalent to 19.6% p.a between 1979 and 1992. The total number of nests increased from 45 in 1987 to 57 in 1989. The average annual exponential rate of increase in the nesting between 1979 and 1989 was 0.149 (p=0.0002) or equivalent to 16.1% p.a. Variations in egg and hatchling survivorship, inconsistency in the number of gharial released, the location and the time of release, and mortality in fishing nets are biases in the data."
659,1557,"Albatross response to survey vessels: implications for studies of the distribution, abundance, and prey consumption of seabird populations","The study of marine bird ecology at sea is complicated by the tendency of many species to follow and otherwise attend vessels. Vessel-attraction likely biases abundance estimates and blurs the correlation between seabird distributions and habitat features over scales of tens of kilometers. Moreover, ship-following behavior inhibits the statistical analysis of seabird distributions because samples too closely spaced in time and space are not independent. These biases have important implications when estimating the size of rare and endangered seabird populations and the prey consumption by abundant species. This paper illustrates how observations of seabird vessel-attendance can be used to mitigate the biases of vessel-attraction and ship-following behavior. I quantified the degree of albatross attraction to survey vessels off southern California, and estimated that standard 300 m strip transects overestimated their abundance by at least a factor of 3.57. Additionally, I modeled albatross ship-following behavior, and determined that 95% of recognizable black-footed (Phoebastria nigripes) and Laysan (P. immutabilis) albatrosses ceased to follow the survey vessel after 60 and 38 min respectively. Using these models, I estimated that standard survey methods overestimated black-footed albatross abundance by a factor of 1.17 due to their ship-following behavior. When the vessel-attraction and ship-following biases were combined, standard survey techniques overestimated albatross squid consumption off southern California by a factor of 4. Determining the degree of vessel-attraction and the temporal scale of ship-following behavior will help design and analyze seabird surveys. These improvements will enhance our ability to monitor the distribution, abundance, and prey consumption of seabird populations."
660,3058,"Survival and population growth of a long-lived threatened snake species, Drymarchon couperi (Eastern Indigo Snake)","Demographic data provide a basis for understanding the life history and ecology of species, factors which are vital for informing conservation efforts; however, little is known regarding the population ecology of most snake species, including the threatened Eastern Indigo Snake (Drymarchon couperi). We used 11 years (19992009) of capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and 2.5 years (20032005) of radiotelemetry data from southeastern Georgia, USA, in a CMR modeling framework to estimate apparent survival, capture and transition probabilities, and evaluate factors influencing these parameters. The model-averaged estimate of overall apparent annual survival probability was 0.700 (±0.030 SE) and is comparable to that obtained from known fate analysis (radiotelemetry) at the same site. Body size positively influenced survival, regardless of sex. Capture probability differed seasonally by sex, suggesting lower capture probability for females in fall and males in winter. There was no evidence for effect of precipitation or site-specific differences in survival. Model averaged estimate of annual adult survival estimated using multistate CMR models was 0.738 ± 0.030 and 0.515 ± 0.189 for subadults. We estimated population growth rate (k) and elasticity (proportional sensitivity) of k to vital rates using a stage-structured matrix population model. Population growth rate ranged from 0.96 to 1.03 depending on the value of the probability of transitioning from subadult to adult stage. The k was proportionally most sensitive to changes in adult survival rate, followed by subadult survival. Our results suggest that protecting adult snakes and their habitats would result in the highest likelihood of long-term population stability and growth."
661,1707,Hyper-abundance of Native Wild Pigs (Sus scrofa) in a Lowland Dipterocarp Rain Forest of Peninsular Malaysia1,"This study reports extraordinarily high density estimates for the wild pig (Sus scrofa) from ail aseasonal tropical Forest site within the species' native range. At Pasoh Forest Reserve, a 2500 ha area of lowland dipterocarp rain forest in Peninsular Malaysia, line transects were used to estimate pig density front May to October in 1996 and 1998. In 1990, 44 sightings of S. scrofa consisting of 166 individuals were recorded along 81 km of transects. In 1998, 39 sightings documented 129 individuals along 79.9 km of transects. Estimated population density was 47.0 pigs/km(2) in 1996 and 27.0 pigs/km(2) in 1998. Sus scroll biomass in this forest was estimated at 1837 kg/km(2) and 1346 kg/km(2) in 1996 and 1998, respectively. Differences between Years were attributed to changes in the density of young pigs, coincident with a mast-seeding year of dipterocarp trees in 1996. Pig densities at Pasoh Forest Reserve were much higher than at other forest locations within the species' native range in Europe and Asia. Because Pasoh Forest Reserve is a forest fragment, two factors likely account for the extremely high pig densities: (1) local extinction of natural predators (mainly tigers and leopards) and (2) an abundant Year-round food Supply of African oil palm fruits from extensive plantations bordering the reserve."
662,706,Changes in breeding bird populations in North Dakota: 1967 to 1992-93,"We compared breeding bird populations in North Dakota using surveys conducted in 1967 and 1992-93. In decreasing order, the five most frequently occurring species were Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris), Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), Red- winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), and Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus). The five most abundant species-Horned Lark, Chestnut-collared Longspur (Calcarius ornatus), Red-winged Blackbird, Western Meadowlark, and Brown-headed Cowbird-accounted for 31-41% of the estimated statewide breeding bird population in the three years. Although species composition remained relatively similar among years, between-year patterns in abundance and frequency varied considerably among species. Data from this survey and the North American Breeding Bird Survey indicated that species exhibiting significant declines were primarily grassland- and wetland-breeding birds, whereas species exhibiting significant increases primarily were those associated with human structures and woody vegetation. Population declines and increases for species with similar habitat associations paralleled breeding habitat changes, providing evidence that factors on the breeding grounds are having a detectable effect on breeding birds in the northern Great Plains."
663,1477,"Population decline of loggerhead turtles: two potential scenarios for Fethiye beach, Turkey","Based on nesting data over a 12-year period (1993-2004), this study points to a negative population trend of the loggerhead turtle population at Fethiye beach, Turkey. The number of nests fluctuated from a maximum of 186 in 1995 to a minimum of 58 in 2004. Successively smaller peaks at 3-year intervals were followed by successively smaller troughs. Two analyses-one representing a dampened oscillation, the other retaining the period and the amplitudes of the nesting cycles-predict that nest number will drop to about 40-50 by 2015, i.e. to about 22-27% of its highest value. This drop at Fethiye does not correspond with a visible increase at neighboring beaches, leading to the interpretation that the number of nesting turtles here is declining. Moreover, the carapace size of emerging adult females is apparently decreasing, as are clutch sizes. Such a potential negative trend at a key Turkish nesting beach is cause for concern, an incentive for continued study, and a call for more coordinated and effective conservation programs in this region of the Mediterranean.

Grouses are; also currently threatened by habitat modification and human disturbance, and an assessment of the impact of; multiple stressors is needed to predict the fate of Alpine populations of these birds in the next decades. We estimated; the effect of climate change and human disturbance on a rock ptarmigan population living in the western Italian Alps; by combining an empirical population modelling approach and stochastic simulations of the population dynamics; under the a1B climate scenario and two different disturbance scenarios, represented by the development of a ski; resort, through 2050.The early appearance of snow-free ground in the previous spring had a favorable effect on the; rock ptarmigan population, probably through a higher reproductive success. On the contrary, delayed snowfall in; autumn had a negative effect possibly due to a mismatch in time to molt to white winter plumage which increases; predation risk. The regional climate model PROTHEUS does not foresee any significant change in snowmelt date in; the study area, while the start date of continuous snow cover is expected to be significantly delayed. The net effect in; the stochastic projections is a more or less pronounced (depending on the model used) decline in the studied; population. The addition of extra-mortality due to collision with ski-lift wires led the population to fatal consequences; in most projections. Should these results be confirmed by larger studies the conservation of Alpine populations would; deserve more attention. To counterbalance the effects of climate change, the reduction of all causes of death should; be pursued, through a strict preservation of the habitats in the present area of occurrence."
665,1053,Risks of decline and extinction of the endangered Amsterdam albatross and the projected impact of long-line fisheries,"The Amsterdam albatross (Diomedea amsterdamensis) is one of the rarest bird species of world avifauna, consisting of a single population in the upland plateau of Amsterdam Island (SE Indian Ocean). All breeding birds of the population are today banded and a monitoring program involving mark-recapture procedures has been carried out continuously over the past 16 years. We present the first estimate of risk of decline for the Amsterdam albatross using a stochastic matrix population model, and evaluate the extent to which the measurement errors in demographic estimates may affect the baseline conservation assessment. We also estimate the potential effect that resumption of long-line fisheries in the vicinity of Amsterdam Island (one the alleged causes for its low numbers in the recent past) may have on the persistence of this population. Our results indicate that, in the absence of any impact of long-line fisheries, the Amsterdam albatross is unlikely to experience a decline larger than 20% of the current population abundance over the next 50 years. Our results point out the difficulty to assess with certainty the extinction risk of small populations despite the availability of long term data on their demography. They suggest that a very cautious approach should be taken for the preservation of small populations of long-lived species that cannot sustain any level of incidental by-catch. Any new long-line fishery resuming in the foraging range of the Amsterdam albatross, but especially close to Amsterdam Island, may rapidly put this species at risk of extinction. "
666,893,"Successful recovery of North Island kokako Callaeas cinerea wilsoni populations, by adaptive management","Kokako Callaeas cinerea wilsoni (Callaeidae) populations are declining in unmanaged primary forests of the North Island, New Zealand. An 8-year experiment to determine the cause of decline was undertaken by controlling introduced browsing and predatory mammal pests in two forest areas, then monitoring pest abundance, kokako chick output and adult density in the managed forests and an unmanaged non-treatment block. Treatments were switched between the unmanaged and one of the managed areas after 34 years. Reduction of pests, especially brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula and ship rats Rattus rattus, to very low levels resulted in significant increases in kokako chick output and adult density in all three study populations. This was due primarily to increased success of nesting attempts, which then increased the number of pairs attempting to breed, initially as newly recruited young females formed pairs with residual single males. The 'adaptive management' approach of using routine large-scale pest control in a co-ordinated experiment to directly test the pest-limitation hypothesis enabled researchers and managers to investigate the cause of decline and to increase populations simultaneously. Predation is a more immediate cause of current kokako declines than competition. Management to recover vulnerable kokako populations should aim to reduce possums and ship rats to very low levels (< 1% trap catch for possums; < 1% tracking rate for ship rats, using particular indexing techniques) at the onset of the kokako nesting season, for several consecutive years."

A; total of 13 sevengill and 228 school sharks were tagged during a full annual cycle. From analysis of catch per; unit effort we found that the species studied show a strong seasonal pattern in the Golfo Nuevo, with higher; abundance from mid-Summer to Autumn and a lower one during Spring, when two school shark recaptures; were registered north from the tagging site (38º and 40° S). These results represent the first direct evidence; supporting the hypothesis of a unique school shark population in the South Atlantic Ocean. Nevertheless, the; detection of male school sharks in the study site all year round indicates that at least part of the population; could be spending the cold months of the year south of its distribution area. In the case of the sevengill shark,; despite that few individuals were captured, the absence of the species during cold months suggest a seasonality; similar to the school shark."
668,3380,Population status of White sturgeon in the Lower Columbia River within Canada,"The subpopulation of white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus in the Canadian portion of the Columbia River between Hugh L. Keenleyside Dam and the U.S.-Canada border has been identified as endangered, with nearly 30 consecutive years of consistent recruitment failure. The objectives of this study were to determine the status and population attributes of this subpopulation. We estimated survival rates and abundance using catch-curve analysis and mark-recapture models. An annual survival rate of 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88-90%) was estimated for the subpopulation using catch-curve analysis for the time period 1993-2004. The survival rates estimated from the mark-recapture data were obtained using model-averaged parameter estimates from a multistrata Cormack-Jolly-Seber model. The annual survival rate from the mark-recapture model was estimated at 97% (95% CI, 92-99%) from 1993 to 2004. The mark-recapture methods estimated abundance for 2004 to be 1,157 individuals (95% CI, 414-1,900). The mark-recapture data suggest that the white sturgeon have low migration rates, ranging from 3% to 5% among sections of the river. Despite high estimated survival, high uncertainty as to the future viability of the white sturgeon subpopulation in this portion of the river remains, as natural recruitment is poor. The fish continue to age, and size and age-frequency data suggest that recruitment failure continues in this subpopulation with minimal presence of wild juvenile or subadult white sturgeon detected.

Yield-per-recruit analysis showed that an excessive fishing effort and principally a very low length at first capture lead to an increase in overfishing in the region. Corrective measures are recommended."
670,4570,"Biological aspects of the butterfly kingfish Gasterochisma melampus: distribution, total catch, size composition and CPUE","Biological aspects of butterfly kingfish Gasterochisma melampus were examined using Japanese longline fishery data and research data collected for over 20 years. Butterfly kingfish were distributed in a continuous band around the circumpolar region between 35°S and 45°S. The southern limit of distribution corresponded with the sub-Antarctic front. The estimated global total annual catch for butterfly kingfish ranged from 613 to 3699 t (mean 1859 t) with Japan taking the largest proportion of the total catch. Large, adult butterfly kingfish spawn in the south-eastern Pacific, whereas smaller, immature fish are distributed in feeding grounds in the area extending across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans to the south-western Pacific Ocean. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) data for fish in the feeding grounds from 1993 to 2016 were compared with the CPUE value from 1970. These data indicate that the stock is currently not likely to be depleted."

672,2209,Population development of the white-tailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla in Bulgaria in the period from 1977 to 2005,"By the end of the 1970s only one breeding pair of White-tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla was left in Bulgaria. New data on the species, collected in the succeeding decades for the whole country, are presented in this paper. The material was sampled mainly from the mid-winter counts on the Danube between 1977 and 2005, and from observations in the country, at times including the breeding season. A definite increase of the number was found. It is more pronounced along the Danube. At least 9 pairs were recently breeding along the Danube and a further 3 pairs along the Black Sea coast. The positive change started in the late 1980s. The reasons are the strict protection of the species and the recovery of the White Poplar Populus alba forests on many places on the islands along the Danube river. The White-tailed Eagle has also been observed recently in many places inland in the country. Special attention should be given to further protection of the White Poplar forests on the Danube islands."
673,957,Comparison of aerial counts with ground counts for large African herbivores,"1. Over the past 50 years, aerial counts have been widely used in African wildlife management; however, the accuracy of the resulting estimates has rarely been questioned. The reliability of aerial counts of large African herbivores was examined by comparing the results of a series of systematic aerial sample counts with those from a series of line transect foot counts conducted in the Lupande Game Management Area in Zambia. 2. For most large herbivore species, the estimates from the aerial counts were considerably lower than those from the ground counts. The data pointed to undercounting as a major problem of aerial surveys. During the aerial counts, significant numbers of animals were missed on the transects, first due to the low probability of spotting single animals, small groups of animals and less conspicuous ones (sighting probability bias), and secondly because part of the population was concealed by obstructions and therefore not visible to the observers (visibility bias). 3. The main factors that influence visibility of large herbivores from the air are the animals' reactions to an over-flying aircraft, dispersion, body size and colour. Animals that move in response to an aircraft are more likely to be seen than static ones; dark-coloured animals are easier to spot than light-coloured ones against a light background; large herds are easier to detect than small ones; and large animals are more easily seen than small ones. Body size is important while trying to spot grazers and mixed feeders from the air, while colour is important for spotting browsers. This is mainly due to the differences in habitat use, with browsers being confined to the thicker habitat. 4. To minimize undercounting bias, both conventional aerial counts and aerial line transect counts should be restricted to large conspicuous grazers and mixed feeders in medium to large group sizes, such as elephant Loxodonta africana africana, buffalo Sincerus caffer, zebra Equus burchell, wildebeest Connochaetes and lechwe Kobus leche. Operational factors, such as height, speed and strip width, should be kept within reasonable limits for conventional aerial counts. Only one species should be counted at a time, always applying the double-count technique. For aerial line transect counts, the use of a helicopter is a prerequisite to obtaining accurate estimates. Other important considerations are observer experience and flight duration."
674,1934,Sampling design and its effect on population monitoring: how much monitoring do turtles really need?,"Marine turtles are a taxon of world-wide conservation concern. Effective long-term monitoring is hampered by the fact that populations are widely dispersed except during the breeding season. Thus most monitoring programmes focus on nesting beaches, necessitating resource intensive studies, often over months, that could conceivably, be less comprehensive and focus on more parsimonious sampling. We analyse 11 years of exhaustive monitoring data for two species of Mediterranean marine turtles (Chelonia mydas and Caretta caretta). We resample using a variety of plausible sub-sampling regimens to estimate the total annual nesting population. We project our dataset into the future applying a range of population change rates to explore how adopting a monitoring programme based on sub-sampling would, for example, affect our ability to detect population decline. We show that accurate annual population estimates can be achieved with as few as 14 days of survey effort providing monitoring spans the peak of nesting. Furthermore, the modelled impact of sampling-based monitoring suggests that the duration to detect population change is not increased greatly. Our findings have implications for all marine turtle monitoring and have applicability to other animal groups. It is often considered desirable to perform exhaustive monitoring, with aversion of basing policy recommendations on partial data. However, comprehensive long-term monitoring programmes, particularly in developing nations, although presenting a number of advantages, are often impossible. Accurate total annual censuses can be achieved through a variety of sub-sampling regimens without sacrificing the ability to detect changes in the population trends over time. In this example, a solid block of at least 3 weeks sampling that encompasses the peak of the nesting season is advised. "

676,3232,Population characteristics and seasonal migrations of leatherback sea turtles at high latitudes,"Efforts to model populations of the leatherback sea turtle Dermochelys coriacea and; design appropriate conservation measures for this endangered species have been hindered by a lack; of information on in-water (vs. nesting) population characteristics. We present the first synthesis of; population characteristics of leatherbacks at high latitudes. During 8 seasons of fieldwork (1999 to; 2006) off Nova Scotia, Canada, we collected biological data from 152 turtles, including 127 livecaptured; individuals. The size-class distribution mainly represented large sub-adult and adult individuals; (mean curved carapace length = 148.1 cm). Mean body mass was 392.6 kg (range: 191.9 to; 640 kg). We found a significantly female-biased sex ratio (1.86 females:1 male) among mature turtles.; We expect that there may be geographical variation in sex ratios of foraging populations reflecting; breeding periodicity, distance from nesting areas, and associated migration patterns. Tag recoveries; from 25 leatherbacks captured off Canada reveal nesting origins throughout South and Central; America and the Caribbean. Recapture data suggest that although some female turtles proceed to; Canadian waters within several months of nesting (in the same calendar year), entry into high-latitude; coastal waters of the western Atlantic may more regularly occur later in the nesting remigration; interval. Comparison of data from leatherbacks off Canada with those from a foraging population at; similar latitudes off France reveals unequal size-class distributions, which may reflect the different; thermal regimes in these areas."
677,2126,"The recreational fishery in the Kosi estuarine lake system, South Africa","The Kosi estuarine system, located in northern KwaZulu-Natal, is becoming an increasingly popular angling venue. Recreational catch card data from the National Marine Linefish System for the years 1986 to 1999 were analysed to determine total catch, catch composition, catch per unit effort (CPUE), seasonality of catches and annual trends in catch composition. A total of 17 families, comprising 34 species, was reported in catches of recreational anglers. Pomadasys spp., predominantly Pomadasys commersonnii, was the most prominent taxon caught in terms of both numbers and mass. Seasonal trends in catch rates were observed, with more fish caught in the summer and autumn months. The catch rate fluctuated annually. Fluctuations in CPUE were closely correlated to the number of cards collected, which reflects bias in the data. Despite annual fluctuations in CPUE, regression analysis revealed a slight increase in overall CPUE with time. However, CPUE for Acanthopagrus berda and Lutjanus argentimaculatus decreased steadily since 1986. The decline of these two estuarine-dependent species may indicate that the total fishing levels are not sustainable."
678,2990,Temporal variability of a temperate fish assemblage in Africa's oldest marine protected area,"A standardised research-based, shore-angling survey was conducted in the 47-year-old Tsitsikamma National Park Marine Protected Area (MPA) between 1998 and 2005. The aim of this study was to examine variability in community structure, relative abundance (catch per unit effort, CPUE) and size frequency of the shore-angling fish assemblage in this no-take MPA. A total effort of 8 141 angler hours yielded 8 236 fish of at least 54 species from 19 families. The overall CPUE showed no significant trend over time (r2 = 0.015, p = 0.1). The interannual variation in CPUE indicated relatively stable populations for some species (e.g. blacktail Diplodus capensis) and patterns of recruitment failure for others (e.g. galjoen Dichistius capensis). However, the lack of a significant trend in taxonomic distinctness (r2 = 0.008, p = 0.8), the stable rank order of species abundance (χ2, r = 361, p < 0.05) and the high coefficient of concordance (W = 0.84) indicated a relatively stable fish assemblage. This was attributed to the extended length of protection afforded by this MPA. One noticeable trend was an increase in the abundance of species with an affinity for warm water and whereas this correlated to an annual increase in water temperature of 0.024 °C between 1998 and 2005, a longer time-series is necessary to identify rise in sea temperature (climate change) as a driver of change in this warm-temperate fish assemblage. "
679,4512,"Resilience of fish assemblages in the Breede Estuary, South Africa, to environmental perturbations","Biogeographical transitional areas are often characterised by fluctuating environmental conditions and high variability in species composition and abundance. A 10-year summer sampling programme was undertaken in the permanently open Breede Estuary, situated between the winter and bimodal rainfall regions and in the cool/warm-temperate biogeographical transition zone. This allowed for the collection of data highlighting inter-annual changes in the fish community of a transition zone estuary and relating these changes to selected environmental variables (salinity, temperature and flow). Although the abundance of individual species varied on an inter-annual basis, the ranking of fish taxa in the Breede Estuary varied little over the 10-year period, indicating a fairly stable species composition. Multivariate analysis showed that the fish communities sampled in summer within each reach (upper, middle, lower) remained similar, regardless of year, and this was largely driven by salinity patterns which showed little inter-annual variation during the low-flow summer period. The Breede Estuary is, however, subject to regular winter and spring flooding, where up to 50% of the annual rainfall may occur over a few days. Although the magnitude of flooding prior to sampling had little effect on species abundance, changes in the frequency or return-time of events did; such that when two floods occurred in succession species abundance and richness declined."
680,2125,Long-term stability of the fish assemblages in a warm-temperate South African estuary,"Little is known about long-term changes in estuarine fish populations and related environmental variations. Fishes in the temporarily open/closed East Kleinemonde Estuary were sampled bi-annually, in summer and winter, using seine and gill nets between December 1994 and July 2005. A total of 18 families, represented by 33 species, were recorded. The 10 most abundant species caught were consistently recorded in catches each year, but CPUE of individual species varied on an annual basis and this can often be related to mouth state. Multivariate analyses of the annual marine fish community identified two distinct groups, with more species recorded during years that succeeded spring (September to November) mouth-opening events than in years following no mouth-opening events in spring. Interannual community stability (IMD) and seriation (IMS) also increased from the years following no opening events in spring to the years that succeeded spring opening events. These results highlight the importance of the timing of mouth opening to the marine fish community in a temporarily open/closed estuary. This study reinforces the importance of long-term studies to understanding community changes in estuaries caused by environmental variations over different time scales. "

682,4016,"Seasonal dynamics and breeding of amphibians in pristine forests (Bialowieza National Park, E Poland) in dry years","In summer 1992 through spring 1994, amphibian abundance and breeding was; studied in the pristine temperate forests, typical of central European lowlands. The years 1991,; 1992, and 1993 were among the driest in the recent decades, with the spring-summer; precipitation 35% lower than the long-term average. In the primeval forests of Bia?owie?a; National Park, common frogs Rana temporaria spawned in small (on average, 0.2 ha) ponds; (postglacial melt-out hollows) devoid of wood cover and characterised by water pH 5.1-6.0 (as; measured in April).

683,2790,A review of the status of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in Chinese waters,"The status of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in Chinese waters (including Taiwan) is reviewed. Within China, humpback dolphins range from the Vietnam border north to the mouth of the Yangtze River, and there are estimated to be about eight populations in China. Little is known of stock structure, except for a preliminary conclusion that animals in Xiamen and Hong Kong represent separate populations. Abundance has been estimated only for Hong Kong and the Pearl River Estuary (about 1,500 animals) and Xiamen (80 dolphins). In the early 1960s, 36 animals were killed in Xiamen Harbor, but other direct takes appear to be rare. Incidental catches are known in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Estuary, but their impacts are not known. Only preliminary work on life history has been conducted. There appears to be a calving peak from spring to summer, and calves are about 100 cm long at birth. Scant data indicate that sexual maturity in females may occur at about 9-10 years of age, with males maturing later. Dolphins in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Estuary have individual ranges averaging 99.5 km2, only a small portion of the population's range. Humpback dolphins in China feed on several species of demersal and estuarine fishes, with little evidence of predation on cephalopods or crustaceans. Contaminants have been evaluated in some areas, and mercury and DDT concentrations in particular appear to be high and potentially health-threatening. An assessment of trends and stranding mortality in the Hong Kong and the Pearl River Estuary population suggests that this stock is probably not decreasing at present. The Xiamen stock is thought to be decreasing, but its status has not been reliably assessed. Essentially, nothing is known of the status of other populations in China, and this shortcoming should be addressed as a matter of priority."
684,2417,Forty years on - the impact of commercial fishing on stocks of New Zealand freshwater eels,"The two main species of freshwater eels in New Zealand, the shortfin Anguilla australis and the endemic longfinned eel A. dieffenbachii, are extensively commercially exploited and also support important customary fisheries. Since there are no commercial glass eel fisheries in New Zealand, other indices Must be used to indicate changes in recruitment over time. While there is some anecdotal evidence of reductions in glass eel recruitment, there is evidence of poorly represented cohorts of longfins within some populations, and modeling of these data indicate a Substantial reduction in recruitment over the past two decades. Growth of both species is typically slow at 2-3 cm per year, meaning that both species are susceptible to commercial capture for many years until spawning escapement. Extensive commercial fishing has resulted in more substantial changes in length-frequency distributions of longfins than in shortfins; likewise, regional reductions in catch per unit effort are more significant for longfins. Theoretical models of silver eel escapement indicate that longfin females are especially susceptible to overexploitation. Shortfins would have been more impacted than longfins by loss of wetlands, but the impact of hydro stations Oil upstream access for juvenile eels and downstream access for silver eels would have been more severe for longfins. Overall, there is no clear evidence that the status of shortfin eel stocks has been seriously compromised by the extensive commercial eel fishery, but there is increasing evidence that longfins are unable to sustain present levels of exploitation."

686,1406,"Long term trends in Harbor Seal numbers at Tugidak Island and Nanvak Bay, Alaska","We conducted land-based counts of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) and collected related environmental data at Tugidak Island (Gulf of Alaska, 1994-2000) and Nanvak Bay (Bristol Bay, 1990-2000) to estimate population trends and identify factors influencing counts. At Tugidak Island, the seal population declined substantially during molting from 1976 through the 1980s, stabilized in the early 1990s, and increased at a moderate rate (3.4%/yr, CI: 1.0%-5.8%) from 1994 to 2000. Pups and all seals ashore during pupping increased at higher annual rates of 5.4% (CI: 2.2%-8.8%) and 8.3% (CI: 4.5%-12.3%) from 1994 to 2000 at Tugidak Island. At Nanvak Bay seals declined in abundance between 1975 and 1990 but increased during the 1990s at 9.2%/yr (CI: 7.2%-11.3%) during pupping and 2.1%/yr (CI: 0.6%-3.6%) during molting. Date and time-of-day were significant covariates in all analyses. Factors that led to declines at Tugidak Island and Nanvak Bay have seemingly abated sufficiently such that these populations are currently increasing, though still greatly reduced from the 1970s. Index sites are useful adjuncts to aerial surveys, providing survey-related information not always available from aerial counts, which is useful in survey design and data analysis. "

688,2585,"Mating Behavior, Population Growth, and the Operational Sex Ratio: A Periodic Two‐Sex Model Approach",": We present a new approach to modeling two?sex populations, using periodic, nonlinear two?sex matrix models. The models project the population growth rate, the population structure, and any ratio of interest (e.g., operational sex ratio). The periodic formulation permits inclusion of highly seasonal behavioral events. A periodic product of the seasonal matrices describes annual population dynamics. The model is nonlinear because mating probability depends on the structure of the population. To study how the vital rates influence population growth rate, population structure, and operational sex ratio, we used sensitivity analysis of frequency?dependent nonlinear models. In nonlinear two?sex models the vital rates affect growth rate directly and also indirectly through effects on the population structure. The indirect effects can sometimes overwhelm the direct effects and are revealed only by nonlinear analysis. We find that the sensitivity of the population growth rate to female survival is negative for the emperor penguin, a species with highly seasonal breeding behavior. This result could not occur in linear models because changes in population structure have no effect on per capita reproduction. Our approach is applicable to ecological and evolutionary studies of any species in which males and females interact in a seasonal environment."
689,3659,Island differences in population size structure and catch per unit effort and their conservation implications for Komodo dragons,"Species inhabiting archipelagos are often characterised by high levels of interpopulation divergence (e.g. size related traits). This divergence may, in turn, influence their life-history. To facilitate better management and conservation of the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), an island endemic, we identified demographic differences between two island populations in Komodo National Park, Indonesia. Comparison of data collected from dragon populations inhabiting Rinca Island and the much smaller Gili Motang Island indicated that between 1994 and 2004, the Komodo dragon population on Gili Motang significantly decreased its: (1) mean body mass, (2) body condition and (3) relative abundance. These results suggest that the numerically small Gili Motang population was oscillating downwards; in contrast, the Rinca Island population had been relatively stable. More importantly these results emphasize the necessity for managers of this priority conservation species to understand further the inherent functional differences among dragon populations to develop island specific management units. Current management practices (e.g. monitoring) instigated by Komodo National Park management ignore small island dragon populations and thus run the risk of being unable to detect adverse effects for populations that are potentially most prone to decline.

690,2793,"Breeding population dynamics and habitat transition of Saunders's gull Larus saundersi in Yancheng National Nature Reserve, China","Saunders's Gull Lams saundersi is a breeding endemic of Common Seepweed Suaeda glauca habitats on the east coast of China and south-west coast of South Korea. Much of this habitat has been lost and degraded due to human land use and expansion of the introduced Smooth Cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. Yancheng National Nature Reserve (NNR) is one of three breeding and wintering areas in China. We used satellite images from 1992 to 2007 and visual interpretation combined with ground truthing to classify the land cover and quantify changes in land use and land cover (LULC) in areas of Yancheng NNR used by Saunders's Gull. The Common Seepweed habitat, in which this species nests, decreased in area by 79.1% (27,358 ha) over 15 years, predominantly as a result of conversion to aquaculture ponds (18,929 ha), and is now centred in the south-east of Yancheng NNR. The total population size of Saunders's Gull was maintained at over 900 individuals from 1999 to 2006 in Yancheng NNR, but was only 575 in 2007, and the number of breeding sites decreased from eight in 1992 and 1994 to a single site in 2000-2006 and two sites in 2007. From 1999 to 2007, the breeding population in the core area of Yancheng NNR accounted for 94.93% of the total population, and its nest-site spatial turnover rate was 0.84 [plus or minus] 0.08 (n = 7 years), but it tended to decrease by about 40% in 2007 because of degradation of the Common Seepweed community. The conversion of Common Seepweed habitats to other habitat types and expansion of introduced Smooth Cordgrass were the major and direct reasons for the loss and degradation of breeding habitats of Saunders's Gull. Smooth Cordgrass habitats increased in area by 321.9% (11,057 ha) during this period and centred on the east, gradually occupying the mudflats, except the beach from Liangduo River to the south of Yancheng NNR, where potential breeding sites for the Saunders's Gull could be located. We discuss the implications of our results for the conservation this species and management of its habitats."
691,2743,Long-term studies and conservation of greater flamingos in the Camargue and Mediterranean,"The Camargue delta of the Rhone River (southern France) is the only place in France where the Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber roseus breeds, and it is the most important breeding site in the western Mediterranean. The numbers of breeding pairs and chicks raised have been monitored for 50 years (1947-1996). Following intensive management of this colony, the number of birds breeding in the Camargue increased from 4,000-5,000 pairs in the 1950s to an average of 13,500 in 1986-1996. Since the size of the colony is limited by the size of its island, this led to the expansion of the number of breeding sites in the western Mediterranean as a whole. Banding studies begun in the 1940s have shown that flamingos of Camargue origin exploit wetlands throughout much of the Mediterranean region and west Africa. Some individuals are sedentary, while others are migratory or opportunistic. Studies of the flamingo indicate that 1) single colonies such as the Camargue can be managed successfully enough to serve as a source population that can fuel expansion into an entire region, 2) movements and reproductive success of birds in the Camargue colony extend to the entire western Mediterranean region, 3) feeding areas of individual colonies may be up to 180 km from colonies, and 4) long term studies (50 yr) have revealed that mortality is extremely episodic and unpredictable; only long-term studies therefore seem capable of accurate estimation of demographics for this long-lived species."
692,4440,Demography of a Small and Isolated Population of Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) Threatened by Vegetative Succession,"Reforestation of early successional vegetation types has been implicated in the decline and extirpation of snake species dependent on exposed basking sites. Consequently, basking-site improvement measures (e.g., brush clearing) are frequently proposed to conserve threatened and endangered snake populations; however, demographic response of snakes to vegetation manipulation is largely unknown. This study measured changes in reproductive fitness, survival, and abundance of females in an isolated population of endangered Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) in years before and after cutting of woody vegetation to create basking opportunities. We marked a total of 181 snakes from 2006 to 2014, over which time substantial vegetation was cleared in key gestation areas to increase availability of basking sites for gravid females. Reproductive cycles of females in this population appeared to be primarily biennial, with parturition dates strongly influenced by maximum daily summer temperatures. Estimated annual survival (s = 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.67-0.86) and number of gravid females (range = 9-46 individuals) showed no temporal trend, nor did body condition (mass relative to length) of gravid females. Our results imply that if a demographic response to basking-site manipulations occurs in Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes, it will significantly lag management intervention."
693,1882,Temporal genetic analysis of the critically endangered oriental white-backed vulture in Pakistan,"Populations of oriental white-backed vultures (Gyps bengalensis) in south Asia have declined over 95% since the mid-1990s due to feeding on livestock carcasses that had been treated with diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical that is fatal to Gyps vultures. To prevent extinction, captive breeding efforts have been initiated; however, given the overall decline, it is not known to what extent levels of genetic diversity currently exist in the remaining populations. Here we document temporal genetic diversity levels during the 2000-2006 interval for the last remaining breeding colony of oriental white-backed vultures in Pakistan, and show with simulations that a much larger captive population size is required than currently maintained to prevent further loss of genetic diversity. Before this species is extinct in the wild, it is crucial that additional individuals are included in the captive population. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
694,4125,Reproductive success of Mariana Swiftlets (Aerodramus bartschi) on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu,"Mariana Swiftlets (Aerodramus bartschi) are federally listed as endangered, with populations currently limited to just three islands in the Mariana Islands plus an introduced population on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu. Before efforts are made to reintroduce Mariana Swiftlets to other islands in the Mariana archipelago, additional information is needed concerning their breeding biology. Therefore, our objective was to examine the reproductive biology of Mariana Swiftlets over five annual cycles on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu. This introduced population used a human-made tunnel for roosting and nesting, and was studied as a surrogate to negate interference with endangered populations in the Mariana Islands. Active nests (N = 478) were observed in every month of the year, with peak nesting activity between May and September. All clutches consisted of one egg. Mean duration of incubation and nestling periods were 23.9 d (range = 18–30 d, N = 233) and 55.0 d (range = 41–84 d, N = 228), respectively. Estimated nest success was 63%. Over half (52%) of nest failures were attributed to eggs found on the tunnel floor. Predation by rats (Rattus spp.) was also an important cause of nest failure and often resulted in the loss of most active nests. However, Mariana Swiftlets did re-nest after these predation events. Our results suggest that rat predation of both nests and adults may limit growth of the Mariana Swiftlet population on O'ahu, and could also affect the chances for successful establishment of relocated populations in the Mariana Islands. Another limiting factor on O'ahu is that only one nesting site is apparently available on the island. Current goals for downlisting Mariana Swiftlets from endangered to threatened include establishing populations on Guam, Rota, Aguiguan, and Saipan. To meet these goals, the population of Mariana Swiftlets on O'ahu can be important for testing reintroduction techniques, learning more about the natural history of these swiftlets, and providing individuals for reintroduction efforts in the Mariana Islands."
695,2337,"Gray-headed Lemur (Eulemur cinereiceps) Abundance and Forest Structure Dynamics at Manombo, Madagascar","Madagascar's ecosystems are subject to high levels of anthropogenic disturbance and stochastic events, including cyclones. We investigated the abundance of gray-headed lemurs (Eulemur cinereiceps) and vegetation structure in the fragmented forest of Manombo from 1995 to 2007, including 10yr following Cyclone Gretelle in January 1997. We predicted that the density of this arboreal, frugivorous lemur would be similar in the pre- and post-cyclone intervals only if tree measures demonstrate trends toward recovery in the post-cyclone period. Initial impacts included severe damage to over 60 percent of trees. After 10yr, all vegetation metrics except for stem density remained low relative to the pre-cyclone period, including dbh, height, and basal area. To investigate vegetation changes separately from cyclone effects, we compared forest structure in the pre-cyclone period alone. Basal area declined but dbh and stem density did not vary between 1995 and 1997; thus, anthropogenic activities or other factors did not consistently alter forest structure in this 2-yr period. Subsequent changes may be linked to cyclone response, presumably in synergy with human disturbance. Contrary to predictions, recent gray-headed lemur population densities were nearly identical to those recorded in 1995 (13.5 ± 3.2 vs. 13.6 ± 6.4 individuals/km2, respectively). Lemur populations may have remained stable or declined initially and then recovered in the last 10yr. Life history and ecological adaptations may explain their resistance or resilience when faced with habitat change. Recent models suggest that lemurs have evolved in response to unpredictable environmental conditions. Such environmental variability may increase with projected climate change. "
696,3316,"The demography of recovery of an overexploited bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, population","An exploited bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, population experienced a 28-fold increase in adult density during a 10-year period from a minimum of 60 individuals. This demonstrates the extent to which this population was overharvested. Its ability to respond in fewer than two generations to the implementation of zero-harvest regulations suggests this population was growth-overfished not recruitment-overfished. Examination of stock-recruitment relationships of various life stages indicates that recovery of this population was regulated by the density-dependent survival of juveniles in the rearing creek. This compensatory response occurred between egg deposition and age-1 and regulated the number of fish recruiting into the adult population. A second population bottleneck became apparent later in the recovery process when density-dependent survival of the adult population resulted in its approach to an asymptote, highlighting the necessity of long-term data sets for examining these compensatory responses. Results from this study demonstrate the importance of understanding the influence of individual life stages on the ability of overexploited populations such as threatened bull trout to recover and for their future management.

697,1495,"Demography of Lemur catta at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar: Effects of Troop Size, Habitat and Rainfall","We censused Lemur catta within a 1 km2 study area at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar, during the September-October birth season for 19 years between 1963 and 2000, a total of 290 troop counts (266 with age and sex). The non-infant population was 155 in 1972-5, fell to 105 in 1985, and rose to a maximum of 282 in 1997, while troops increased from 12 in 1972-1985 up to 25 in 1998-2000. Local density varies between habitat types from 1 per ha to ca. 6 per ha. Troops fission at ca. 15-25 individuals, or 6-10 females. Adult sex ratio has no apparent correlation with fissions, birth rate or survival. Birth rate falls steeply with number of adult females, from 80-100% in 2-female troops to about 50% in 8-10 female troops. The penalty for large troop size is greater in the dense, rich areas, but nonetheless troops there are also larger. One-year-survival does not vary with troop size, and is lower in the sparse, dry zone. Troop size is too large for optimal birth rate, but fissioning to much lower size might make troops too small for optimal adult survival, given the intense intertroop competition. This reflects Sibley's (1983) conjecture that troop sizes may not reach stable optima. Rainfall per lemur-year (beginning Oct 1) varied from 265 to 894 mm. Drought followed by rain can eliminate >90% of a cohort, especially in the dryest zone. Possibly this results from fruit failure in years following drought. It is unknown whether food supplementation of some Berenty troops is dangerous for the forest, or helpful for an isolated and vulnerable ring-tailed lemur population."
698,4274,Demographic analysis of imperiled Eastern massasaugas (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus),"As quantitative modeling of wildlife populations increases, the need for accurate and precise estimates of demographic rates for these populations also grows. Eastern Massasaugas (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) are an imperiled rattlesnake species found mainly in the Great Lakes region of North America. We focused on an Eastern Massasauga population found on Beausoleil Island in Georgian Bay that was the subject of a 30-yr mark-recapture study for demographic analysis. We estimated multiple demographic values including annual adult survival, the temporal process variance of survival, population size, and population growth rate. Annual adult survival did not differ significantly between sexes (males 0.74; females 0.73). The process variance of annual adult survival for males was 0.006 and was inestimable for females. This is the first estimate of process variance for Eastern Massasaugas and one of the few such estimates for a snake species. The use of the process variance of survival in population prediction resulted in a large decrease in estimated extinction risk compared to use of the total variance of survival (3% and 21% extinction risk, respectively). Population size ranged from 35-77 (mean = 55), and realized population growth rate was equal to 1.02. Our analysis showed the Beausoleil Island population was stable up to the end of the study (2008). Demographic estimates can be used to guide management and conservation of this species."
699,1396,Seasonal variation in habitat use by marsh fishes,"We used 1-m2 throw traps to examine habitat use by small-sized fishes within a mosaic of wet prairies and sloughs in the headwaters of the St. Johns River, Florida between August 1992 and November 1995. Estimates of total fish density and biomass varied temporally, but did not differ significantly between habitats. Patterns of habitat use, however, differed among the five numerically dominant species. Bluefin killifish, mosquitofish, and golden topminnows were more abundant in sloughs than in wet prairies. In contrast, Everglades pygmy sunfish were more abundant in wet prairies than in sloughs. Finally, the abundance of least killifish did not differ between habitats. Fish densities were positively correlated with plant biomass (i.e., habitat complexity) and negatively correlated with water depth (i.e., hydrology). Species richness and composition were similar among habitats. However, consistent differences in the relative abundance of numerically dominant species between habitats indicated some degree of habitat-specific assemblage structure. Most species were concentrated into deeper sloughs during drying events. This assemblage of small-sized fishes appears to respond relatively rapidly to changes in habitat structure and hydrologic conditions. We therefore recommend that resource managers consider using fishes as indicator taxa to evaluate the efficacy of ongoing restoration and management efforts in wetland systems."

701,1905,Temporal trends in elephant Loxodonta africana numbers and densities in northern Botswana: is the population really increasing?,"The apparent increase in elephant Loxodonta africana numbers in northern Botswana is of concern because it may affect other species. We compared changes in population growth rates based on elephant numbers and densities over 1973-2004. Population estimates and survey details extracted from published and unpublished sources allowed us to calculate growth rates. From 1973 to 1993 growth rate was positive when based on elephant numbers but did not differ from zero when calculated for densities. This discrepancy may be because of the significant increase in survey area during the same period. In contrast, none of the growth rates differed from zero for time series between 1996 and 2004, when the size of the survey area varied little. We propose two explanations for these results. The first suggests that the population did not grow, while the second proposes that the population expanded its range and increased in size. Notwithstanding, an equilibrium model best explained the variance in dry season estimates of elephant numbers for the complete time series. Such apparent density-dependence could be disrupted by any artificial reduction of numbers through culling as a management option in northern Botswana."
702,2582,Methods for assessing population size in sand dune lizards (Liolaemus multimaculatus),"Basic information, such its population size and density, is needed for conservation and management of many Species, especially threatened Species. Thus, well-designed population monitoring programs that use appropriate methods for estimating parameters of interest, including density and survival, are needed as well and distance-sampling are established methods for estimating density in wildlife surveys. The sand dune lizard (Liolaemus multimaculatus) is an endemic and vulnerable species that inhabits dime habitats in Argentina. At present, however, there are no accurate estimates of density of, this species and no established monitoring programs. The objectives of this study were (1) to test the use of mark-recapture and distance-sampling, methods and (2) to estimate density of this species in Mar Chiquita Reserve (37[degree] 37[minute] S-57[degree] 16[minute] W), an important area for the protection of this species. For distance-sampling surveys, we used a systematic line-transect design; for mark-recapture sampling, we performed exhaustive surveys and captured, marked, and recaptured lizards manually. Based on distance-sampling, populations were estimated at 3.6 and 5.4 individuals per ha in 2007 and 2008, respectively; corresponding estimates based on mark-recapture data were 5.2 and 4.1 individuals, per hit in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Detection probabilities were 0.23 in both 2007 and 2008 distance-sampling analyses and capture Probabilities were 0.02 and 0.05 in 2007 and 2008 mark-recapture analyses. Based on these estimates, the, Mar Chiquita Reserve contains a population of at least 10,000 individuals. Both methods were adequate. for estimating populations of sand dune lizards, given the facility with which individuals call be detected and captured. The distance-sampling method requires less effort, but the mark-recapture method allows estimates of survival its well its density, v. Results of this work provide the baseline for developing it monitoring program for this lizard, and we suggest that the distance-sampling method be used to monitor all populations of sand dune lizard."
703,1277,Population declines of Yosemite toads in the Eastern Sierra Nevada of California.,"Describes changes in the size of a breeding population of Bufo canorus over 20 yr at Tioga Pass, California. The total number of marked males entering the largest breeding pools at Tioga Pass declined nine-fold from 1974-1982. The mean number of toads found in daily searches during breeding also dropped. In 1990 there was evidence for continued reproduction at all but one location (Sylvester Meadow), although reproduction was minimal at Tioga Pass. The authors interpret the decline in the study populations as caused primarily by drought, disease, and predation. Spring snow depths in 1976, 1977 and 1987-91 were below the 62 yr average, resulting in low tadpole survival. The death of adults from disease at Tioga Pass, and from predation at another site (Mildred Lake) also contributed to the declines. -from Authors"

About 6000 zebra and 10,000 wildebeest were in the Plains in the middle of the rainy season, in April. During the dry season in August the animals were concentrated in the Park. The migration from the Park to the Plains started at beginning of the rains, in November/December Recent censuses by Tanzania Wildlife Conservation Monitoring (TWCM, 1991, 1995) indicate that an estimated 23,000 zebra and 11,000 wildebeest migrate into the Park from Simanjiro and other wet season areas. Encroaching cultivation is a threat to the migration corridors and sustainability of the ecosystem. Providing benefits from wildlife to communities around the park would safeguard the future of the wildlife."
705,4584,Increasing or decreasing? - Current status of the Japanese eel stock,"Although Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica, is listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, a previous stock assessment of the Japanese eel estimated that the age 1+ stock of the species has been recovering since 1990. To help understand the population dynamics of wild Japanese eels, eel fisheries in coastal and estuarine areas in Japan were investigated, because inland fisheries cooperative associations have conducted eel stocking that is presumed to bias the fisheries data in inland waters of Japan. We conducted a questionnaire survey of 1509 fisheries cooperative associations in coastal and estuarine areas of Japan, where the possible bias of eel stocking is expected to be relatively low. Based on the questionnaire, exploitable eel (yellow and silver eels) catch and effort data from 2003 to 2018 were obtained from six fisheries cooperative associations. A standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) was developed using a generalized linear model for each fisheries cooperative association. The results indicated that the standardized exploitable eel CPUE was significantly lower in four of the six associations. As for the other two associations, significant relationships between CPUE and year was not found. Additionally, of the 227 fisheries cooperative associations that confirmed they catch eels, 1.3%, 5.3%, 21.6%, and 71.8% answered that the eel stock is “relatively increasing,” “stable” “relatively decreasing,” or “decreasing,” respectively, with no association stating that the eel stock is “increasing.” Moreover, reported glass eel CPUE in nine prefectures in Japan was significantly lower in both periods of 1977–2018 and 2003–2018. Because the dataset used in this study is likely to be one of the best currently available, the wild Japanese eel stock appears to be currently declining in Japanese coastal and estuarine waters, where the bias of eel stocked eels on stock dynamics is thought to be relatively low."

When microtines had high densities during two consecutive years, Arctic fox litter size only responded to the first year.

708,4177,"Adaptive management of sika deer populations in Hokkaido, Japan: theory and practice","We investigated the utility of adaptive management (AM) in wildlife management, reviewing our experiences in applying AM to overabundant sika deer (Cervus nippon) populations in Hokkaido, Japan. The management goals of our program were: (1) to maintain the population at moderate density levels preventing population irruption, (2) to reduce damage to crops and forests, and (3) to sustain a moderate yield of hunting without endangering the population. Because of significant uncertainty in biological and environmental parameters, we designed a feedback management program based on controlling hunting pressure. Three threshold levels of relative population size and four levels of hunting pressure were configured, with a choice of four corresponding management actions. Under this program, the Hokkaido Government has been promoting aggressive female culling to reduce the sika deer population since 1998. We devised a harvest-based estimation for population size using relative population size and the number of deer harvested, and found that the 1993 population size (originally estimated by extrapolation of aerial surveys) had been underestimated. To reduce observation errors, a harvest-based Bayesian estimation was developed and the 1993 population estimate was again revised. Analyses of population trends and harvest data demonstrate that hunting is an important large-scale experiment to obtain reliable estimation of population size. A serious side effect of hunting on sika deer was inadvertent lead poisoning of large birds of prey. The prohibition of the use of lead bullets by the Hokkaido Government was successful in reducing the lead poisoning, but the problem still remains. Two case studies on sika population irruption show that the densities set by maximum sustainable yield may be too high to prevent damage to agriculture, forestry, and/or ecosystems. Threshold management based on feedback control is better for ecosystem management. Since volunteer hunters favor higher hunting efficiency in resource management (e.g., venison), it is necessary to support the development of professional hunters for culling operations for ecosystem management, where lower densities of deer should be set for target areas. Hunting as resource management and culling for ecosystem management should be synergistically combined under AM."

710,766,Beating the odds: effects of weather on a short-season population of deer mice,"We examined 11 years of data on reproductive success, survival, and population dynamics of two populations (Fortress and Grizzly) of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in the Kananaskis Valley, Alberta, to investigate the extent to which the dynamics of these populations is dictated by weather conditions. Summer population growth was not related to the population growth in the winter preceding the breeding season or to spring population density. Over the summer on the Fortress grid, population growth was positively related to adult survival, whereas on the Grizzly grid, population growth was positively related to nestling survival. Neither summer population growth nor demographic correlates of summer population growth was consistently related to weather patterns. On Fortress, adult survival during the breeding season was negatively correlated with precipitation. On Grizzly, nestling survival during the breeding season was negatively correlated with precipitation. Winter population growth was inversely proportional to the fall population density prior to the winter but neither was related to weather conditions. Climate limits seasonal breeding in these populations, but compensatory responses appear sufficient to accommodate extreme weather conditions during both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons."

There were considerable; changes in the distribution of several species within the Moray Firth, probably in; response to changes in the food supply attributed to improvements to sewage and; distillery discharges and to associated declines in fi sh and Blue Mussel Mytilus edulis; populations. The Moray Firth supports internationally important numbers of two; species (Great Northern Diver Gavia immer and Slavonian Grebe Podiceps auritus) and is; nationally important for 10 other diver, grebe and seaduck species. The area supports; the largest numbers of wintering Long-tailed Duck and the second largest numbers; of Great Northern Diver, Red-throated Diver G. stellata, Slavonian Grebe, Common; Scoter, Velvet Scoter and Goldeneye in Britain."
712,2091,The nuthatch Sitta europaea population of Dalby Soderskog during 15 years: trend and fluctuations,"Nuthatches Sitta europaea were censuses each spring 1977-91 in the 36 ha Dalby Soderskog national park, an old, mixed deciduous wood of oak Quercus robur, elm Ulmus glabra and beech Fagus sylvatica, situated less than 10km ESE of Lund, southernmost Sweden. The number of territories varied between four and 21, that of pairs between four and 230, with one to three unpaired males defending territories in five of the years. The population size in spring co-varied positively with winter temperatures. Over the 15-yr period, the population showed a statistically significant positive trend, increasing by c0.7 pairs or territories per year. Similar increases in nuthatch populations have been reported from Poland, Denmark, Great Britain and Sweden during the same period, and in other Fennoscandian passerines during the last three or four decades, and may be associated with increasing mean winter temperatures."
713,3997,Estimating seasonal abundance and habitat use of small carnivores in the Western Ghats using an occupancy approach,"Rigorous population studies on many small carnivores are lacking in India. Presence-absence models; with habitat covariates were applied to estimate seasonal occupancy and abundance of nine small-carnivore species; from camera-trap data in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (2010 and 2011). We deployed 25 camera-trap stations in the; deciduous forest, 21 in the semi-evergreen forest and 26 in the dry thorn forest. In total, 7380 trap-nights yielded 448; photographs of small carnivores: jungle cat (n=72), leopard cat (n=6), rusty-spotted cat (n=11), small Indian civet; (n=89), common palm civet (n=37), brown palm civet (n=20), stripe-necked mongoose (n=66), ruddy mongoose; (n = 96) and Indian grey mongoose (n = 51). In the dry season, rusty-spotted cat was the rarest carnivore with an; average abundance (?mean) of 0.24 ± 0.26, while ruddy mongoose was the most abundant (?mean = 0.90 ± 0.40).; In the wet season, leopard cat was the rarest species (?mean = 0.048 ± 0.041) while grey mongoose was the most; abundant (?mean = 0.68 ± 0.35). Abundance of jungle cat, common palm civet, ruddy mongoose and grey mongoose; increased in the dry thorn forest whereas in the dry season abundance of small Indian civet decreased in this forest type.; Abundance of leopard cat and small Indian civet was not influenced by habitat in the wet season. Deciduous forest; was positively associated with abundance of rusty-spotted cat. Deciduous and semi-evergreen forests had a positive; effect on abundance of stripe-necked mongoose while the latter was a positive predictor of abundance and occupancy; for brown palm civet. Improved modelling approaches can account for the spatio-temporal variation in habitat use of; small carnivores occupying specialized niches in heterogeneous tropical forests of southern India."
714,3601,"Fish species assemblages and geographical sub-areas in the North Aegean Sea, Greece","The faunal composition and species abundance indices, according to data collected during 1996-2000 within the framework of the Mediterranean International Trawling Survey Program (MEDITS) at 65 sampling sites in North Aegean Sea and its surrounding coastal basins, were used to determine fish species assemblages, their geographical distribution and temporal variation. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to detect fish species associations and 11 principal axes were extracted, accounting for the 67.1% of system's variance. According to these fish assemblages, three main geographical areas were distinguished in the North Aegean Sea: the Thracian Sea, Thermaikos gulf and the southern part of the sampled area, between the coast of Asian Minor and the Eastern coast of the Greek peninsula. These areas could be used for future multi-species fishery management purposes, related to the particular environmental conditions prevailing in each unit. "
715,3789,The Current State of Colonial Waterbirds in Srebarna Managed Reserve,"The colonial waterbirds in Srebarna Managed Reserve was studied in 2001-2003. The direct counting of individuals was used to estimate the number of breeding pairs. In Srebarna Reserve breed 13 colonial waterbirds Pelecanus crispus, Phalacrocorax carbo, Phalacrocorax pygmeus, Nycticorax nycticorax, Ardeola ralloides, Egretta garzetta, Egretta alba, Ardea cinerea, Ardea purporea, Plegadis falcinellus, Platalea leucorodia, Larus ridibundus and Chlidonias hybrida) distribute in five colonies. The total number of breeding pairs in 2002 and 2003 showed 50 % decrease of pairs compared to that of 2001. These differences are probably due to variations of the water level. The great decrease of breeding pairs was observed in the heronry. The less change was estimated in the colony of other bird species. The water level is an important factor for the number and distribution of waterbird species because it affects other environment factors such as the feeding sites and water surface area."
716,3833,Global population collapse in a superabundant migratory bird and illegal trapping in China,"Persecution and overexploitation by humans are major causes of species extinctions. Rare species, often confined to small geographic ranges, are usually at highest risk, whereas extinctions of superabundant species with very large ranges are rare. The Yellow-breasted Bunting (Emberiza aureola) used to be one of the most abundant songbirds of the Palearctic, with a very large breeding range stretching from Scandinavia to the Russian Far East. Anecdotal information about rapid population declines across the range caused concern about unsustainable trapping along the species migration routes. We conducted a literature review and used long-term monitoring data from across the species range to model population trend and geographical patterns of extinction. The population declined by 84.394.7% between 1980 and 2013, and the species range contracted by 5000 km. Quantitative evidence from police raids suggested rampant illegal trapping of the species along its East Asian flyway in China. A population model simulating an initial harvest level of 2% of the population, and an annual increase of 0.2% during the monitoring period produced a population trajectory that matched the observed decline. We suggest that trapping strongly contributed to the decline because the consumption of Yellow-breasted Bunting and other songbirds has increased as a result of economic growth and prosperity in East Asia. The magnitude and speed of the decline is unprecedented among birds with a comparable range size, with the exception of the Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), which went extinct in 1914 due to industrial-scale hunting. Our results demonstrate the urgent need for an improved monitoring of common and widespread species populations, and consumption levels throughout East Asia."
717,2807,Population trend and distribution of the vulnerable common hippopotamus Hippopotamus amphibius in the Mara Region of Kenya,"The common hippopotamus Hippopotamus amphibius can significantly influence the dynamics of ecosystems and engender serious conflicts with people but, in Kenya, one of the species strongholds, it has been little studied or monitored. We surveyed the hippopotamus population in the Masai Mara National Reserve and the adjoining pastoral ranches in 2006 using foot counts along 155.3 km of the main rivers. We counted 4,170 hippopotamuses in 171 schools. Comparisons with earlier surveys suggest that this population increased by 169.6% between 1971 and 1980 within the reserve and, although it did not increase within the reserve during 1980[long dash]2006, it increased by 359.4% outside the reserve during this period against a background of deteriorating habitat conditions. The overall density in 2006 was 26.9 hippopotamuses km-1 of river, equivalent to a biomass of 26,677 kg km-1 of river. The ratio of calves to 100 adults was 9:100 inside the reserve, 10:100 outside the reserve and 6:100 along tributaries of the Mara River, implying that the population is either increasing or that its spatial distribution is being compressed because of range contraction. The apparent increase in the hippopotamus population contrasts with marked contemporaneous declines in the populations of most other large mammalian herbivore species in the Reserve. We discuss possible reasons underlying the increase in the hippopotamus population."
718,1725,"Impacts of Cyclone Larry on arboreal folivorous marsupials endemic to upland rainforests of the Atherton Tableland, Australia","Intense cyclones might be expected to adversely affect populations of arboreal mammals, either directly or as a consequence of the destruction of food resources and other key habitat elements. However, such impacts have rarely been quantified. The present study examined the response of five species of arboreal folivorous marsupials to Severe Cyclone Larry at nine sites in upland rainforests of the Atherton Tableland, north-east Australia. Sites were originally surveyed for folivores in 1995-1997, and then resurveyed in 2006, 6-8 months after Cyclone Larry had traversed the region. All sites showed evidence of structural damage to vegetation, but overall damage levels (assessed in terms of canopy cover, damage to trees, basal area of dead trees and volume of woody debris) decreased from east to west across the study region. The detectability of rainforest possums increased after the cyclone. For the most commonly observed species, the proportion of individuals observed >5 m from survey transects was correlated with the amount of structural damage to vegetation. To avoid confounding changes in detectability with changes in abundance, only observations close (<5 m) to transects were used to estimate folivore abundance before and after the cyclone. On this basis, there were no significant differences between pre- and post-cyclone abundance estimates for any folivore species. Further, changes in folivore abundance after the cyclone were not correlated with damage to vegetation across sites. Cyclone Larry does not appear to have caused a catastrophic loss of key habitat resources for marsupial folivores at the sites surveyed. The high degree of folivory practiced by marsupial folivores may help make them resilient to cyclone impacts. These conclusions are more robust for three commonly observed folivore species (Hemibelideus lemuroides, Pseudochirulus herbertensis and Trichosurus vulpecula johnstonii) than for two less frequently encountered species (Pseudochirops archeri and Dendrolagus lumholtzi). "
719,1642,Changes in adult annual survival rates in a western European population of the White stork ciconia ciconia,"The population of the White Stork Ciconin ciconia in Alsace (northeastern France) has decreased considerably since 1961. Using recent captureerecapture models, we analysed resighting data on ringed birds resulting from a long‐term ringing programme carried out in 1947–1985. Time‐dependence and age‐dependence in annual survival rates are examined with reference to environmental variables in the Sahel wintering area. Our results show a decrease in adult annual survival rate linked to the severity of the drought in the Sahelian zone. "
720,2653,Assessing tiger population dynamics using photographic capture-recapture sampling,"Although wide-ranging, elusive, large carnivore species, such as the tiger, are of scientific and conservation interest, rigorous inferences about their population dynamics are scarce because of methodological problems of sampling populations at the required spatial and temporal scales. We report the application of a rigorous, noninvasive method for assessing tiger population dynamics to test model-based predictions about population viability. We obtained photographic capture histories for 74 individual tigers during a nine-year study involving 5725 trap-nights of effort. These data were modeled under a likelihood-based, ""robust design'' capture-recapture analytic framework. We explicitly modeled and estimated ecological parameters such as time-specific abundance, density, survival, recruitment, temporary emigration, and transience, using models that incorporated effects of factors such as individual heterogeneity, trap-response, and time on probabilities of photo-capturing tigers. The model estimated a random temporary emigration parameter of [gamma]'' = [gamma]' = 0.10 [plus or minus] 0.069 ( values are estimated mean [plus or minus] SE). When scaled to an annual basis, tiger survival rates were estimated at S = 0.77 [plus or minus] 0.051, and the estimated probability that a newly caught animal was a transient was [tau] = 0.18 [plus or minus] 0.11. During the period when the sampled area was of constant size, the estimated population size Nt varied from 17 [plus or minus] 1.7 to 31 [plus or minus] 2.1 tigers, with a geometric mean rate of annual population change estimated as [gamma] = 1.03 [plus or minus] 0.020, representing a 3% annual increase. The estimated recruitment of new animals, Bt, varied from 0 [plus or minus] 3.0 to 14 [plus or minus] 2.9 tigers. Population density estimates, D, ranged from 7.33 [plus or minus] 0.8 tigers/100 km2 to 21.73 [plus or minus] 1.7 tigers/100 km2 during the study. Thus, despite substantial annual losses and temporal variation in recruitment, the tiger density remained at relatively high levels in Nagarahole. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that protected wild tiger populations can remain healthy despite heavy mortalities because of their inherently high reproductive potential. The ability to model the entire photographic capture history data set and incorporate reduced-parameter models led to estimates of mean annual population change that were sufficiently precise to be useful. This efficient, noninvasive sampling approach can be used to rigorously investigate the population dynamics of tigers and other elusive, rare, wide-ranging animal species in which individuals can be identified from photographs or other means."
721,3035,"Inferring trends in a small-scale, data-limited tropical fishery based on fishery-independent data","Size-based indicators have emerged as useful tools to analyze the status of fisheries which lack fishery; dependent data over long time series, such as many coral reef fisheries. In this study, we calculate a; number of size-based indicators for the Haitian fishery at the remote Navassa Island, where a reef fish; visual census (RVC) data set is available over an 8-year study period (20022009). We also calculate; the slope of the size spectrum indicator within a Bayesian framework, which allows for potential biases; inherent in the RVC method to be accounted for in credibility intervals around parameter estimates.; Results of our analyses suggest that stocks targeted by traps declined from 2002 to 2004, followed by a; period of increase from 2006 to 2009. The slope of the size spectrum declined from 2002 to 2004 and; remained constant for the remainder of the study period, and this pattern was driven by a decrease in; abundance of larger species targeted by hook-and-line. Analysis of the Lmax spectrum also indicated; a decrease in the occurrence rates of larger species throughout the study period. Our methods can be; applied to fisheries in other areas where limited fishery-independent data and no fishery-dependent; data are available."
722,4046,Ecology and demography of the Critically Endangered Kandian torrent toad Adenomus kandianus: a long-lost endemic species of Sri Lanka,"The tropical island nation of Sri Lanka is a biodiversity hotspot with a high diversity and endemism of amphibians. The endemic, stream-dwelling Kandian torrent toad Adenomus kandianus is Critically Endangered and was considered to be extinct until its rediscovery in 2012. The species is now known from two localities in tropical montane forests. We conducted a 4-year study using transect surveys and opportunistic excursions to assess habitat associations, demographics and abundance of A. kandianus in and around Pidurutalagala Conservation Forest. We recorded a mean of 44.25 post-metamorphs per year, with a density of < 1 individual per 100 m2, with occurrence within a narrow extent (c. 0.005 km2) of the stream channel. Behaviour and microhabitat selection varied depending on sex and stage of maturity. The species preferred moderately sized montane streams with rocky substrates and woody debris, colder temperatures, and closed-canopy, intact riparian forests. We noted size-based reversed sexual dimorphism and a strong ontogenetic relationship between snout-vent length and body weight. Anthropogenic activities such as intensive crop farming deterred the species; proximity to croplands had a negative influence on abundance. We recommend re-delineation of the boundary of Pidurutalagala Conservation Forest to incorporate the toad's habitat into the core of the reserve and thus limit the impacts of human activities. Conservation and management actions such as ex-situ breeding, population monitoring, and restoration of degraded habitats could also contribute towards the persistence of this toad. Our findings provide useful insights into ecological research on and conservation of range-restricted aquatic amphibians."
723,3208,Population trends of common wintering waterfowl in Japan: participatory monitoring data from 1996 to 2009,"We analyzed population trends of 13 waterfowl (Anseriformes) species wintering in Japan during a 14-year period (1996-2009). We used data from annual volunteer-participatory waterfowl count surveys which were conducted in Japan by the Ministry of the Environment and local prefectural governments. Population indices and long-term trends of each species were calculated using TRIM (TRends and Indices for Monitoring data). TRIM is a freeware program developed for analysis of time series count data with missing observations. During the 14 years, seven species exhibited significant long-term declines, while four species showed long-term increases. Most of the species that showed long term declines were characterized as being water-surface foraging species, species breeding in both middle and high latitude regions, or species using rice fields. Most species that showed long-term increases were characterized as diving species, species breeding at high latitude or species rarely using rice fields. We calculated composite indices for these groups. The group of water-surface foraging species showed declines in river, natural lakes and artificial lakes, except reservoirs, when each habitat was analyzed separately. In contrast, the group of diving foraging species showed an increase in estuarine habitat. We suggest that changes in: water quality, breeding habitat in the middle latitude region, and in cultivation methods in rice fields, have affected population changes of some species and groups. "
724,4338,"Nesting of the Green turtle, Chelonia mydas, in the Mediterranean: a review of status and conservation needs","The status of the Green Turtle, Chelonia mydas, nesting population in the Mediterranean is reviewed on the basis of literature records and unpublished data. It is estimated that 350 to 1750 clutches are laid per year, from which an annual nesting population of 115 to 580 females can be estimated. 99% of all recorded nesting occurs in Cyprus and in Turkey, with the remainder being found in the Lebanon, Israel and Egypt. Interannual fluctuations in the number of nests follows a relatively synchronous pattern across the region. 78% of all nests are concentrated at five key sites, three of them in Turkey (Akyatan, Kazanlı, Samandağ) and two in northern Cyprus (North Karpaz, Alagadi). As well as making the nesting population vulnerable, this concentration allows the focussing of conservation efforts. The existing threats to the nesting sites are described in detail; they are multifold, and include destruction of nesting habitat for tourism and agriculture, beach erosion and pollution. By-catch of turtles in fisheries, direct exploitation, nest predation, and global warming pose additional threats. Despite extensive turtle research in the Mediterranean, our knowledge of the size of the Green Turtle population and population dynamics are still insufficient. Increased consistent monitoring in tandem with conservation management is needed. "
725,3938,Density estimates and conservation of Leopardus pardalis southernmost population of the Atlantic Forest,"Using camera traps and capture/recapture analyses we recorded the presence and abundance of cat species at Turvo State Park, in southern Brazil. Ocelot [Leopardus pardalis (Linnaeus, 1758)] population density was estimated for two areas of the park, with differing management profiles. Density estimates varied from 0.14 to 0.26 indiv. km2. Another five cat species were recorded at very low frequencies, precluding more accurate analyses. We estimate 24 to 45 ocelots occur in the reserve, which is probably too small for long-term maintenance of the population, if isolated. However, if habitat integrity and connectivity between the Park and the Green Corridor of Misiones is maintained, an estimated ocelot population of 1,680 individuals should have long-term viability."
726,2656,Abundance decline in the finless porpoise population in the Inland Sea of Japan,"From 5 March to 1 July, 1999 and 2000, we made six shipboard surveys for finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) in the Inland Sea, which is believed to be inhabited by one local population of the species. Each survey lasted 2-24 days and covered nearly the entire extension of the sea. In principle, we followed the method of Kasuya and Kureha (1979) and attempted to revisit as many ferry tracks surveyed by them as possible, but we used a greater number of observers for some selected surveys and added some new tracks. Records of strandings and incidental mortality of the species were also analyzed. Comparison of the two sets of survey data, which were about 22 years apart, did not show establishment of new habitat in the Inland Sea, but confirmed disappearance of some habitat previously occupied by the species. All the 18 tracks surveyed by both studies showed various degrees of density decline, and the decline was statistically significant for 12 of them. The sighting rate (number of finless porpoises sighted per 100 km survey) declined in both nearshore and offshore strata. Using the 18 tracks and combining all strata, we estimated that the current density was about 4% that of the late 1970s in the middle and eastern Inland Sea, while it was about 70% in the western Inland Sea. From these results, we conclude that the finless porpoise population in the Inland Sea has dramatically declined. This decline was consistent with the trends of strandings and mortalities in fishing gear. Entanglement in fishing nets is the only documented human-caused mortality for the population. However, the decline was probably a result of compound effects of various types of environmental degradation, including destruction of coastal habitats due to construction, chemical pollution, red tide and vessel traffic."
727,2937,The interactions of predator and hare populations in Finland - a study based on wildlife monitoring counts.,"Numerical relationships between predators (red fox Vulpes vulpes, pine marten Martes martes, lynx Lynx lynx) and mountain hare (Lepus timidus) were studied using the data from the Finnish wildlife monitoring scheme in 1989-2000. Line transect (wildlife triangle) data were used to obtain snow track indices of relative predator abundance. Finland was divided into 29 100 x 100 km squares, each including the mean of 348 km of transect line (total length > 10 000 km annually). The abundance of fox was related to the yearly growth rate of hare populations in 48% of the squares. The growth rates of fox and hare populations also correlated in 45% of the squares, indicating that there was a mutual relationship between hare and fox populations in about half of the squares. This relationship existed in areas with low/moderate hare and high fox numbers (a low hare/fox index) but was lacking in areas with a high hare/fox index, pointing to both functional and numerical response for foxes preying on hares. There was also a positive spatial correlation between hare and lynx numbers, but the correlation between hare and marten numbers was weak."
728,2234,COMPTE RENDU ORNITHOLOGIQUE CAMARGUAIS POUR LES ANNÉES 2001-2006,"The present ornithological report for the Camargue covers six years (2001-2006). This time-period has been marked by an accelerated global warming (the summer 2003 was particularly extreme). Owing to a constant high observation pressure, 18 new species have been recorded and many rare species have been resighted in that region (Camargue, Crau, Alpilles). Among the species or group of species which are regularly censused, the number of breeding Greater Flamingos Phoenicopterus roseus and that of wintering ducks and coots did not show any significant change. The colonial herons have continued either to increase or to fluctuate at a high level. For example, the Great White Egret Casmerodius albus has definitely settled in the delta and the Squacco Heron Ardeola ralloides has reached a new peak of 505 pairs in 2006. More efficient prospection efforts gave more precise breeding numbers for two species of solitary herons, the Great Bittern Botaurus stellaris and the Little Bittern Ixobrychus minutus. New breeding species such as the Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo, White Stork Ciconia ciconia, Eurasian Spoonbill Platalea leucorodia and Greylag Anser anser increased their numbers as well as the Glossy Ibis Plegadis falcinellus of which 14 pairs has bred in 2006 and the Purple Swamphen Porphyrio porphyrio which was found for the first time breeding in 2006. The breeding species showing the most serious concern are actually the breeding gulls and terns whose figures have dramatically decreased. Without human management, this situation will even become worse in a near future. Further remarkable observations were the first case of wintering Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina in 2001/2002, a mixed pair of Black-winged Pratincole Glareola nordmanni x Collared Pratincole G. pratincola in 2001, the settling of the Rook Corvus frugilegus in Arles."
729,2235,COMPTE-RENDU ORNITHOLOGIQUE CAMARGUAIS POUR LES ANNÉES 1995-2000,"The present ornithological report for the Camargue covers six years (1995-2000). This time-period was characterized by mild and wet winters (except the winter of 1999-2000 which was very dry but remained mild). The mean temperatures were all higher than those measured previously. Twenty-two new species have been recorded for the first time (their list is given in the introduction of this paper). The following rare species have been observed again: Blue-winged Teal (a ringed bird in Québec/Canada shows the wild origin of at least one of the three birds seen), Lesser Scaup, Ring-necked Duck, Eastern Imperial Eagle, Lanner Falcon, Saker Falcon, Purple Swamp-hen, Great Bustard, Black-winged Pratincole, Great Sand Plover, Sociable Lapwing, Purple Sandpiper, Buff-breasted Sandpiper, Wilson's Phalarope, Audouin's Gull, Arctic Tern, Common Guillemot, Blue-cheeked Bea-eater, Horned Lark, Richard's Pipit, Blyth's Pipit, Isabelline Wheatear, Desert Wheatear, Paddyfield Warbler, Marsh Warbler, Barred Warbler, Yellow-browed Warbler, Red-breasted Flycatcher, European Nuthatch, Rosy Starling, Snowfinch, Trumpeter Finch and Lapland Longspur. Among the species or group of species which are regularly censused, two arboreal herons (Little Egret and Cattle Egret) have dramatically increased their numbers; the 680 pairs of Night Heron and 266 pairs of Squacco Heron in 2000 must be outlined. The Grey Heron stopped its spectacular increase and the Purple Heron continued to fluctuate (1 370 nests in 1996 and 664 nests in 2000). The Greater Flamingo reached the very high figure of 22 200 pairs in 2000 (13 000 in 1996). The breeding gulls and terns in the salines showed some new trends: the Black-headed Gull dramatically decreased (but began to colonize freshwater breeding sites), the Mediterranean Gull reached the very high number of 1 877 pairs in 2000, the Slender-billed Gull maintained its high breeding number (850 pairs in 2000). The four tern species showed the usual fluctuations. The high number of breeding Yellow-legged Gull remained a concern. The salines at Salin-de-Giraud harboured most of the breeding population during this time-period whereas the salines at Aigues-Mortes lost most of their birds. The wintering ducks and coots continued their overall decrease considered as linked to excessive hunting pressure (mostly through disturbance effect of hunting on feeding grounds). The species that have been found breeding for the first time are the Great Cormorant (in 1998), the Great White Egret (first sucessful breeding in 1996), the Eurasian Spoonbill (in 1998), the Eagle Owl (in 2000) and the Pied Wagtail. Among the breeding species, the Collared Pratincole showed a good breeding success in 2000 (42 pairs and 45 fledglings) and several breeding records were found for the Great Spotted Cuckoo. Some species increasingly overwintered: Night Heron, Black Stork, White Stork, Black Kite, Osprey, Common Crane, Stone-curlew, Little Ringed Plover, Common Tern and Pine Bunting."
730,4178,Cascading Consequences of the Loss of Large Mammals in an African Savanna,"African savannas are home to an abundant and diverse assemblage of wild herbivores, but the very grasses that sustain these wild herds also make savannas attractive to humans and their livestock. We used the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment to investigate the ecological effects of different combinations of native and domestic grazers. The experimental removal of large grazing mammals set into motion a cascade of consequences, beginning with the doubling in abundance of a small grazing mammal, the pouched mouse (Saccostomus mearnsi). The presence of abundant mice attracted venomous snakes such as the olive hissing snake (Psammophis mossambicus); devastated seedlings of the dominant tree (Acacia drepanolobium); and doubled the abundance of fleas, which potentially increased the risk of transmission of flea-borne pathogens. Together, these results show the potential for the loss of large mammals to have cryptic consequences for African savannas, with important and often undesirable repercussions for humans. "
731,4277,Post-catastrophe patterns of abundance and survival reveal no evidence of population recovery in a long-lived animal," Population catastrophes are widespread, unpredictable phenomena occurring in natural populations that have important, yet frequently underappreciated, consequences for persistence. As human impacts on ecosystems increase globally, the frequency of catastrophes is likely to rise as increasingly fragmented and depleted populations become more vulnerable. Species with slow life histories are expected to recover slowly from catastrophes because of their longer generation times, and assessing their population recovery requires data spanning long periods. We report results from a long-term markrecapture study of snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, that experienced a major mortality event from winter predation by river otters. We estimated abundance and survival of nesting females before, during, and 23 yr following the catastrophe. We built multistate markrecapture models incorporating movement between sites, temporary emigration, and observation effects. We found that during the 3-yr mortality event, abundance of nesting females declined by 39% overall, and by 49% at our focal nesting area. Apparent survivorship of nesting females during these three years fell from 0.94 before the mortality event to 0.76 at the focal site and 0.86 at adjacent nest sites. Survivorship over the following 23-yr period averaged 0.972 and 0.940 at the two sampling areas. Despite high post-catastrophe survivorship and connectivity with other populations, the population failed to recover, displaying consistently reduced abundances across 23 post-catastrophe years. We discuss the relationship between life-history attributes and the causes and consequences of local catastrophes and their conservation implications."
732,850,"Mustelid, squirrel, and porcupine population trends during a Snowshoe hare cycle","Rates of capture in live traps set for Lepus americanus were used to index population trends of Mustela frenata, M. erminea, M. vison, Mephitis mephitis, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, Glaucomys sabrinus, Spermophilus franklinii, and Erethizon dorsatum at Rochester, Alberta, during 1965-1975. The Mustela species (weasels and mink) had a 10yr cycle synchronous with that of the snowshoe hare; c81% of the annual variation in weasel numbers, as indexed by capture rates, was attributable to fluctuations of hares, voles (Microtus, Clethrionomys), and mice (Peromyscus). Onset of the cyclic decrease in hares was followed within 2yr by declines in sciurid, skunk (Mephitis), and porcupine populations that may have been a consequence of predator switching as hares became scarce. -Authors"

In order to understand the status of the wildlife populations in this landscape, a dry season total aerial count was conducted from 6th to 12th October 2013. The census covered an area of 25,623 km2 including 9,214 km2 of the Amboseli ecosystem, 6,348 km2 of the Namanga-Magadi areas in southwestern Kenya, 3,013 km2 of the West Kilimanjaro and 7,047 km2 of the Natron areas in North Tanzania. The objectives of the census were to: (i) determine wildlife populations and distributions (ii) determine the extent and spread of human activities; and (iii) identify threats to wildlife conservation in the landscape. The count made use of 9- light aircraft fitted with observer calibrated streamers. Data were captured by observers using GPS and digital voice recorders. The census aircraft comprised of four 4-seater and five 2-seater planes, which were flown along transects spaced at 1000 m intervals within 31 predetermined counting blocks. The aircraft were flown at a mean altitude of 383.8 ±251 ft above ground and a mean speed of 156 Kph. Total counts of elephants, elephant carcasses, buffalo, giraffe, wildebeest, eland and several other wildlife species were made, as well as counts of livestock and other human activity."
734,4273,Enhancement of a declining European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus) population with habitat restoration,"The European ground squirrel is a vulnerable species in Europe, and a critically endangered species in the north-western part of its range. In Hungary, although there are several robust populations on a European scale, we are also witnessing a process of decline. Local individual numbers of the focal species decreased quickly until 2011, caused by the drastic reduction in the grazing and mowing of its habitat. In response to the decline of the focal species’ population, a habitat restoration project was started in 2012 in order to stop and reverse this process. We studied the interventions for habitat restoration (elimination of scrubs and Elaeagnus angustifolia trees, grazing and mechanical mowing) between 2012 and 2015. In the monitoring program the number of European ground squirrel specimens was estimated by the quadrat-method and a small-scale transect survey. Potentially the most effective parameters of vegetation, soil and macroclimate were used as predictor variables. The results of our monitoring study showed that the most significant factors in the differences in the individual numbers were the height of the vegetation, and the depth and percentage of the sand and silt fractions of the soil. The density of Spermophilus citellus was positively affected by the cover of xeric grasses and therophyta plant species, soil depth, the percentage of sand and silt fractions of the soil, and was negatively affected by height of vegetation, cover of scrub, tall-herb plant species, and the percentage of the gravel fraction of the soil. Accordingly, the soil conditions of the target areas should be assessed in advance in order to achieve success in supplying the European ground squirrel population. This could help in the successful planning of interventions and relocation attempts in order to repatriate European ground squirrel populations."
735,3446,Characteristics of Ontario muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) fisheries based on volunteer angler diary information,"This paper consolidates and summarizes information on Ontario muskellunge, Esox masquinongy, sport fisheries derived from angler diary programs sponsored by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) and Muskies Canada Incorporated (MCI) from 1979 to 2004. Interest in muskellunge as a sport fish has increased substantially over the past 1015 years. Muskellunge catches were found to be highly correlated with angling effort. Catch rates, expressed in terms of catch-per-unit-of-effort (CUE), have improved over the past decade to the point where, in 2001, the provincial CUE was 0.119. The long term catch rate is 0.069. This improvement in angling quality is attributed to new minimum size limit regulations and increased; catch-and-release angling practices. Over the period from 19792004, release rates by muskellunge anglers have averaged 94%. Based on a sample size of 9,499 fish, the mean size of angled muskellunge over the past 26 years was 37.0 inches (94 cm). Numerous fish exceeding 50 inches (127 cm) are angled from Ontario waters each year. The incidence of lymphosarcoma, a highly contagious, malignant blood cancer, has averaged only 2% since 1979. Based on an analysis of this information, Ontarios muskellunge fisheries appear to be stable and sustainable. Volunteer angler diary programs provide an accurate and cost-effective means to monitor the status of muskellunge fisheries in Ontario."
736,3648,Trend estimation in populations with imperfect detection,"Trends of animal populations are of great interest in ecology but cannot be directly observed owing to imperfect detection. Binomial mixture models use replicated counts to estimate abundance, corrected for detection, in demographically closed populations. Here, we extend these models to open populations and illustrate them using sand lizard Lacerta agilis counts from the national Dutch reptile monitoring scheme. 2. Our model requires replicated counts from multiple sites in each of several periods, within which population closure is assumed. Counts are described by a hierarchical generalized linear model, where the state model deals with spatio-temporal patterns in true abundance and the observation model with imperfect counts, given that true state. We used WinBUGS to fit the model to lizard counts from 208 transects with 1-10 (mean 3) replicate surveys during each spring 1994-2005. 3. Our state model for abundance contained two independent log-linear Poisson regressions on year for coastal and inland sites, and random site effects to account for unexplained heterogeneity. The observation model for detection of an individual lizard contained effects of region, survey date, temperature, observer experience and random survey effects. 4. Lizard populations increased in both regions but more steeply on the coast. Detectability increased over the first few years of the study, was greater on the coast and for the most experienced observers, and highest around 1 June. Interestingly, the population increase inland was not detectable when the observed counts were analysed without account of detectability. The proportional increase between 1994 and 2005 in total lizard abundance across all sites was estimated at 86% (95% CRI 35-151). 5.Synthesis and applications. Open-population binomial mixture models are attractive for studying true population dynamics while explicitly accounting for the observation process, i.e. imperfect detection. We emphasize the important conceptual benefit provided by temporal replicate observations in terms of the interpretability of animal counts. "
737,4497,"Three decades of longlining in Bimini, Bahamas, reveals long-term trends in lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris (Carcharhinidae) catch per unit effort","In Bimini, Bahamas, the consistent employment of longlines, beginning in 1982, provided a rare opportunity; to explore population trends for large resident sharks. This study assessed three shallow water; longline survey periods at this location; 19821989, 19922002 and 20032014, with the aim of; determining trends in annual catch per unit effort (CPUE) for an IUCN listed near-threatened species,; the lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris. A general additive model (GAM) was used to analyse the; non-linear annual CPUE values over the entire 32-year research period. The GAM displayed high; variability of annual CPUE, with a peak value of 0·026 N. brevirostris per hook day (hooks day?1) in; 2000. The temporal pattern of CPUE indicated an abundance trend with a complete cycle, from trough; to trough, occurring over a period of approximately 18 years. The 19821989 survey period saw the; highest proportion of mature individuals (19·8%) and the smallest average pre-caudal length (LPC;; 124·8 cm). The 19922002 survey period had the highest average annual CPUE (0·018 hooks day?1),; while the 20032014 research period saw largest average LPC size (134·8 cm) and the lowest average; CPUE values (0·009 hooks day?1) of the entire research period. The long-term trend identified in this; study provides a baseline for future assessment."
738,4157,"Segregation and foraging ecology of whale sharks, Rhincodon typus, in the southwestern Gulf of California","Sharks segregate by sex and size, but few studies have attempted to explain such behaviors. To address this, we examined aggregations and the foraging ecology of whale sharks in Bahía de La Paz (BLP) with aerial and ship surveys and direct observation. Zooplankton abundance and composition, and hydrographic conditions were analyzed in relation to whale shark occurrence to explore underlying factors causing segregations. We observed large aggregations of juveniles (<9 m total length, TL) inshore, comprised by 60 % male individuals, and small aggregations of adults (>9 m TL) offshore, composed of 84 % females. Juvenile sharks were associated to turbid shallow waters in BLP, where they performed stationary and dynamic suction feeding on dense copepod swarms. Adults occurred in oceanic waters and fed by ram-filtering on diffuse patches of euphausiids, with no association to oceanographic conditions. Such segregation may be advantageous to juvenile R. typus utilizing shallow coastal waters to find abundant preferred prey needed for their fast growth rates. Our studies suggest that the main driving forces of whale shark segregation by sex and size in BLP may be diet preference for juveniles and habitat preference for adult sharks."
739,4272,"Does a recent surge in Socotra Cormorant Phalacrocorax nigrogularis nesting population and establishment of new breeding colonies ensure long term conservation? Pragmatic assessment of recent augmentation in Abu Dhabi Emirate, UAE","United Arab Emirates is an important range country for the Vulnerable Socotra Cormorant Phalacrocorax nigrogularis and Abu Dhabi Emirate holds most of the remaining breeding colonies. Emirate-wide monitoring of all breeding colonies was undertaken annually for 11 breeding seasons from 20062007 to 20162017 to monitor the status of breeding colonies and estimate the nesting population. Breeding was recorded in 10 colonies that were used intermittently with an average of four (± 1.3 SD) colonies active each year. The highest number of eight active colonies was recorded in 20162017. Establishment of two new breeding colonies on Butinah and Digala in 20162017 and recolonisation of three previously inactive colonies during the monitoring period emphasised the ability of the species to relocate and colonise suitable sites. Continued threats at some breeding colonies caused abandonment and subsequent relocation, resulting in a gradual shift of breeding colonies to safer areas. Presently, most of the breeding sites (62%) with an increased number of breeding birds are found in colonies with restricted access. The Emirate-wide nesting population witnessed a 10-fold increase in the last decade; after an initial decline in 20062007 it increased from about 5,000 pairs in 20072008 to nearly 52,000 nesting pairs in 20162017. Combined with the nesting population from the Siniya colony, the overall UAE nesting population is estimated at 60,000 to 70,000 pairs, nearly half of the global breeding population. Further augmentation of the current breeding numbers is possible if breeding colonies remain safe from human disturbance and invasive predators. For long-term conservation of Socotra Cormorant, protection of all remaining colony sites, including inactive ones, is important in addition to minimising disturbance along with widespread public awareness to change the peoples perception of the species as a competitor to commercial fisheries."
740,4508,"Changes in species composition and abundance of commercially important pelagic fish species in Kigoma area, Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania","The pelagic fishery of Lake Tanganyika provides employment to about 1 million consumers and protein; to many more people living around the lake. It is mainly based on three commercially important fish species; namely two clupeids Stolothrissa tanganicae and Limnothrissa miodon commonly known as dagaa and a; perch Lates stappersii. A declining trend of the perch both in its composition and abundance in the pelagic; fish landings is partly tied to local over-fishing and climate change. There are three important periods in; the exploitation process identified as: (1) a traditional fishery period, the pre-1975 period marked by low; catches of Lates spp. and a dominance of clupeids; (2) an industrial fishery period (19751978) marked; by high catches of Lates stappersii and high total landings; and (3) an artisanal fishery period (post 1984); with relatively low catches and high dominance of clupeids especially Stolothrissa tanganicae. Population; growth and refugee influx from the politically volatile Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo both; caused high fish protein demand, particularly for dried clupeids. Also changes in the rural economy caused; by drought in the area are resulting into high exploitation pressure on the pelagic resources. Concerted; efforts to prevent/reduce exploitation pressure on the pelagic fish resources should take into action a lake; wide management strategy where by management issues in all the riparian countries should be harmonized.; More effort should be geared towards preventing the use of beach seines and small meshed nets subsequently; ensuring a sustainable utilization of the pelagic fish resources."
741,2674,Seasonal changes in the local distribution of Yangtze finless porpoises related to fish presence,"The Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) is an endangered freshwater porpoise subspecies unique to the Yangtze River basin. Seasonal variations in local distribution of the animal, as well as fish presence, sand dredging, ship navigation, and bridges were examined as potential factors affecting the occurrence of the animals. Passive acoustic surveys were performed regularly from May 2007 to August 2010, near the conjunction of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake. The distribution of the porpoises was seasonally site-specific. In May and August, the animals were detected more often at river junctions than in the lake, but vice versa from November to February. The rate of the porpoise detection was significantly higher in areas of fish presence than in areas of absence. The number of porpoises detected did not differ significantly between the sand dredging operation and the prohibition period (in 2008), although the number of vessels obviously declined in 2008. Ship traffic and bridges also did not appear to affect the presence of porpoises. These results showed the relative importance of the various environmental factors, which is important for conservation of not only Yangtze finless porpoise but also endangered isolated cetaceans. "
742,3256,"Population ecology of the Lake Erie water snake, Nerodia sipedon insularum","Population ecology of the Lake Erie water snake, Nerodia sipedon insularum,; is described based on a 5 yr capture-mark-recapture study involving 1449 captures; of 1247 individuals. Water snakes are widespread in the island area of; Lake Erie but have declined in numbers and have disappeared from one island; within the last 50 yr. Population estimates for adult snakes range from 25 to; about 500 individuals on seven islands. Snakes are active from late April until; early October. Males are caught most often during the breeding season in May; and June, while females are taken more often later in summer. Females appear; to feed over a longer portion of the active season than males, grow at a faster; rate (0.014 vs 0.012 cm/d mean growth rate) and attain a larger body size (82.1; vs 62.5 cm mean snout-vent length). Weight gain occurs throughout the active; season in adult females but is restricted to mid-summer in adult males. Some; females reproduce annually but smaller females may skip opportunities to reproduce.; Number and size of offspring are positively correlated with female size.; Comparisons with data from mainland populations elsewhere in the range of; this species indicate that island water snakes differ in having larger adult body; sizes (mean snout-vent length is 10-16 cm greater in males and 13-14 cm greater; in females), lower growth rates (maximum growth rate is 0.06 cm/d vs 0.13 cm/d; in mainland populations) and shorter tails (by 2-5% in males, 1-3% in females).; In addition, litter size is less strongly correlated with female body size in island; populations (r2 = 0.17 vs 0.34-0.72 elsewhere). Differences may also exist in size; of newborns (mean newborn SVL of mainland population ranges from 12%; shorter to 4% longer than that of island populations), diet (mainland populations; typically consume more amphibians and fewer fish) and intensity of predation; (frequency of stub tails is two times greater in mainland populations)."

744,3305,Partial and clear-cut harvesting of high-elevation spruce–fir forests: implications for small mammal communities,"Subalpine spruce (Picea) - fir (Abies) forests occur throughout the Cordillera of western North America. A variety of alternative silvicultural systems to clear-cutting are being investigated in these high-elevation forests in terms of their impacts on ecosystem components. We tested the hypotheses that abundance, reproduction, and survival of populations of (i) southern red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi Vigors) will decline, (ii) long-tailed voles (Microtus longicaudus Merriam) and northwestern chipmunks (Tamias amoenus J.A. Allen) will increase, and (iii) deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus Wagner) will be similar, with respect to decreasing levels of tree retention. Small mammal populations were live-trapped from 1994 to 1998 in replicated sites of uncut forest, single tree selection, 0.1-ha patch cuts, 1.0-ha patch cuts, a 10.0-ha clearcut, and edges in an Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) -subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) forest near Sicamous, British Columbia, Canada. Clethrionomys gapperi dominated the small mammal community, reaching a peak abundance of 80 animals/ha with mean values ranging from 31 to 50 animals/ha. Over the 4 postharvest years, abundance, reproduction, and survival of C. gapperi populations were consistently similar among uncut forest, single tree selection, and patch cut treatments compared with clear-cut sites where this species declined to extirpation. Microtus longicaudus and T. amoenus occurred predominantly in clearcut sites, whereas P. maniculatus was present in low numbers on all sites. With respect to small mammals, partial harvesting systems appear to provide a means for combining timber extraction with maintenance of mature forest habitat in these subalpine ecosystems."
745,3438,Partial and clearcut harvesting of dry Douglas-fir forests: Implications for small mammal communities,"Dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests offer a wide range of timber and non-timber values, which may benefit from a balanced timber harvest by variable retention systems with conservation of biodiversity. A major component of biodiversity are forest floor small mammal communities whose abundance and diversity serve as ecological indicators of significant change in forest structure and function from harvesting activities. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that abundance, reproduction, and survival of (i) the southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi, formerly Clethrionomys gapperi), will decline; (ii) the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), will be similar; and (iii) the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and northwestern chipmunk (Tamias amoenus), will increase, with decreasing levels of tree retention. Small mammal populations were live-trapped from 1994 to 1997 in replicated sites of uncut forest, 20% and 50% volume removal by single tree selection, 20%, 35%, and 50% patch cuts based on openings of 0.1-1.6 ha, and small 1.6 ha clearcuts in Douglas-fir forest near Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. M. gapperi dominated the small mammal community, starting with an abundance of 74-98 animals/ha with mean values ranging from 33 to 51 animals/ha. In the two post-harvest years, abundance, reproduction, and survival of M. gapperi populations were consistently similar among uncut forest and the various levels of tree retention. Thereafter, M. gapperi was seldom found on the small clearcuts. M. pennsylvanicus, T. amoenus, and P. maniculatus occurred predominantly in clearcut sites. As with other types of forest disturbance, responses to our treatments were species-specific. The most striking result was the high abundance and productivity of M. gapperi populations in a dry forest ecosystem, a novel result for this bio-indicator species of closed-canopy forest conditions. At least with respect to small mammals, the retention systems studied seem to enable timber extraction and maintenance of mature forest habitat in these dry fir ecosystems. "
746,4527,Large-scale recovery of an endangered amphibian despite ongoing exposure to multiple stressors,"Amphibians are one of the most threatened animal groups, with; 32% of species at risk for extinction. Given this imperiled status, is; the disappearance of a large fraction of the Earths amphibians inevitable,; or are some declining species more resilient than is generally; assumed? We address this question in a species that is emblematic; of many declining amphibians, the endangered Sierra Nevada yellowlegged; frog (Rana sierrae). Based on >7,000 frog surveys conducted; across Yosemite National Park over a 20-y period, we show that, after; decades of decline and despite ongoing exposure tomultiple stressors,; including introduced fish, the recently emerged disease chytridiomycosis,; and pesticides, R. sierrae abundance increased sevenfold during; the study and at a rate of 11% per year. These increases occurred in; hundreds of populations throughout Yosemite, providing a rare example; of amphibian recovery at an ecologically relevant spatial scale.; Results from a laboratory experiment indicate that these increases; may be in part because of reduced frog susceptibility to chytridiomycosis.; The disappearance of nonnative fish from numerous water bodies; after cessation of stocking also contributed to the recovery. The; large-scale increases in R. sierrae abundance that we document suggest; that, when habitats are relatively intact and stressors are reduced; in their importance by active management or species adaptive responses,; declines of some amphibians may be partially reversible, at; least at a regional scale. Other studies conducted over similarly large; temporal and spatial scales are critically needed to provide insight; and generality about the reversibility of amphibian declines; at a global scale."
747,2161,Night sampling improves indices used for management of yellow perch in Lake Erie,"Catch rate (catch per hour) was examined for age-0 and age-1 yellow perch, Perca flavescens (Mitchill), captured in bottom trawls from 1991 to 2005 in western Lake Erie: (1) to examine variation of catch rate among years, seasons, diel periods and their interactions; and (2) to determine whether sampling during particular diel periods improved the management value of CPH data used in models to project abundance of age-2 yellow perch. Catch rate varied with year, season and the diel period during which sampling was conducted as well as by the interaction between year and season. Indices of abundance of age-0 and age-1 yellow perch estimated from night samples typically produced better fitting models and lower estimates of age-2 abundance than those using morning or afternoon samples, whereas indices using afternoon samples typically produced less precise and higher estimates of abundance. The diel period during which sampling is conducted will not affect observed population trends but may affect estimates of abundance of age-0 and age-1 yellow perch, which in turn affect recommended allowable harvest. A field experiment throughout western Lake Erie is recommended to examine potential benefits of night sampling to management of yellow perch. Published 2010. The article is a US Government work and is in the public domain in the USA."
748,2033,Population fluctuations and regulation in great snipe: a time-series analysis,"1. During the last centuries, the breeding range of the great snipe Gallinago media has declined dramatically in the western part of its distribution. To examine present population dynamics in the Scandinavian mountains, we collected and analysed a 19-year time series of counts of great snipe males at leks in central Norway, 1987-2005.2. The population showed large annual fluctuations in the number of males displaying at lek sites (range 45-90 males at the peak of the mating season), but no overall trend.3. We detected presence of direct density-dependent mechanisms regulating this population. Inclusion of the density-dependent term in a Ricker-type model significantly improved the fit with observed data (evaluated with Parametric Bootstrap Likelihood Ratio tests and Akaike's Information Criterion for small sample size).4. An analysis of (a number of a priori likely) environmental covariates suggests that the population dynamics were affected by conditions influencing reproduction and survival of offspring during the summer, but not by conditions influencing survival at the wintering grounds in Africa. This is in contrast to many altricial birds breeding in the northern hemisphere, and supports the idea that population dynamics of migratory nidifugous birds are more influenced by conditions during reproduction.5. Inclusion of these external factors into our model improved the detectability of density dependence. This illustrates that allowing for external effects may increase statistical power of density dependence tests and thus be of particular importance in relatively short time series.6. In our best model of the population dynamics, two likely density-independent offspring survival covariates explained 47.3% of the variance in great snipe numbers (predation pressure estimated by willow grouse reproductive success and food availability estimated by the amount of precipitation in June), whereas density dependence explained 35.5%. Demographic stochasticity and unidentified environmental stochasticity may account for the remaining 17.2%."
749,1970,Conserving the Seychelles warbler Acrocephalus sechellensis by translocation from Cousin Island to the islands of Aride and Cousine,"The Seychelles warbler Acrocephalus sechellensis was once a highly threatened single-island endemic species with a population of 26 individuals confined to Cousin Island in the inner Seychelles. Following long-term management of Cousin, the population steadily recovered to around 300-360 birds. Given the vulnerability of one small island in the Indian Ocean, the possibility of establishing the species on additional islands had been proposed as a priority conservation measure, in order to give the species the security of additional breeding populations, lest some ecological disaster should befall the parent population. Successful translocations of warblers to the islands of Aride and Cousine took place in September 1988 and June 1990 respectively. Given the presence now of three healthy breeding populations, it is considered that the Seychelles warbler will soon no longer be a globally threatened species. It is not often that people are allowed to pull a species so dramatically back from the brink of extinction."
750,990,Breeding of the Seychelles Magpie Robin Copsychus sechellarum and implications for its conservation,"The total population of the Seychelles Magpie Robin Copsychus sechellarum declined from 38-41 birds in 12-13 territories in 1977- 1978 to 17-21 birds in eight to nine territories in 1988-1990 and was entirely confined to Fregate Island (210 ha) in the Seychelles. After a successful cat eradication program in 1981-1982, recruitment improved, although the abandonment of agriculture had caused a reduction in the amount of feeding habitat and hence in the carrying capacity of the island. The population declined because of the failure of recruitment to compensate for the annual adult mortality. Foraging activity of the Magpie Robin was greater in high- quality territories (measured by soil invertebrates available), leading to increased reproductive success. Through supplementary feeding, five times as many recruits were produced. Of the 11.5 potential annual breeding recruits. 5.3 are required to compensate for adult mortality, and the other 6.2 recruits can be regarded as 'surplus' contributing to an increase. Magpie Robins prefer to breed in rotten trees, which are a scarce resource. The greater the distance between the nest site and feeding areas, the less time was spent in incubation and nest guarding, resulting in greater egg loss. Because of lack of suitable areas for establishing territories, many young Magpie Robins became 'floaters'. Nest disturbance, both by these floaters and by the introduced Indian Mynah Acridotheres tristis, had adverse effects on the breeding success of robins. A recovery plan has been designed to save the Magpie Robin. Territories have been improved for feeding (by tree planting) and for breeding (by providing nestboxes and reducing nest disturbances). Given the vulnerability of one small island, the presence of surplus birds (supported mainly by supplementary food) and the suitability of neighbouring Aride Island (68 ha), successful translocations to this island took place in 1992 and 1994. Given the presence now of 47 individuals on two islands, it is hoped that the species will pull back from the brink of extinction."
751,3508,Chick production at the largest emperor penguin colony decreases by 50% from 2008-2010.,"The emperor penguin colony at Coulman Island is reputedly the largest known. This reputation is based on intermittent ground and aerial surveys performed since 1958. From an aerial survey obtained on 28 October 2010 we discovered that the total number of chicks was 56% of the lowest previous estimate of 2006 and only 41% of the most recent estimate in 2008. All of the counts tallied since 1983 were determined either by ground counts or from aerial film or digital photographs, or estimates from adult counts. We also determined the sea ice conditions in autumn, which is close to the time the adults arrive to breed. We present three hypotheses of what might have happened from 2008-10 to cause the step change in chick production, the small recovery of chick numbers in 2011, and the complete recovery of number of adults from 2010-11. We conclude that local circumstances may have strongly influenced the breeding behaviour of the emperor penguins in 2010 and to a lesser degree in 2011 when many adults elected not to breed. "
752,3149,Population dynamics of birds of prey in relation to fluctuations in small mammal populations in western Finland,"Primarily examines population fluctuations, clutch sizes and production of young of the long-eared owl Asio otus, short-eared owl Asio flammeus, kestrel Falco tinnunculus and hen harrier Circus cyaneus at Alajoki in 1977-82. Altogether 315 nests or territories of birds of prey were found in the study area. The peak phase of population fluctuations of birds of prey occurred in 1977 (98 breeding pairs); thereafter the populations decreased continuously to about the tenth part in 1981 but a rapid increase occurred next spring (45 pairs). A. flammeus was the most numerous bird of prey (39% of the breeding pairs) followed by F. tinnunculus (36%), A. otus (20%), C. cyaneus (3%). Tengmalm's owl Aegolius funereus (2%) and sparrow hawk Accipiter nisus (+). Field and common voles (Microtus agrestis, M. arvalis) emerged as the most important factors regulating population fluctuations, clutch sizes and the production of young in the birds of prey studied, because Microtus spp. are energetically advantageous prey species. A. flammeus had the largest clutch size of birds of prey in Alajoki, followed by F. tinnunculus, A. otus and C. cyaneus, but population fluctuations were greatest in C. cyaneus and A. otus and clearly smaller in A. flammeus and F. tinnunculus. Results contradict the theoretical prediction that there is a positive correlation between clutch size and the degree of nomadism.-from Author"
753,1648,"Dietary shifts, niche relationships and reproductive output of coexisting Kestrels and Long-eared owls","Food samples of breeding Kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and Long-eared Owls (Asio otus) were collected in the peak and low phase of their preferred prey (Microtus voles) in western Finland. Diets of pairs that bred as neighbours (≤1 km) with interspecifics were compared with those of non-neighbours. In both species, neighbouring pairs fed less on Microtus voles and more on alternative prey than did non-neighbours. Competition theory predicts that diet overlap should be lower during prey shortage and that diet similarity should be especially reduced in neighbouring pairs. Observations were consistent with expectations: diet similarity was lower in the low vole years and neighbouring pairs showed less diet overlap that non-neighbours. Differences in habitat composition and prey availability at the sample sites should not confuse the results. In addition to the high diet similarity, hunting habitats and nest sites of the species overlapped almost completely; they only showed clear temporal segregation in hunting. Probably because of food competition, the neighbouring pairs of both species produced significantly fewer young than the non-neighbours. These results contrast with the view that the diet composition and dietary shift of rodent-feeding predatory birds can be interpreted in terms of simple opportunistic foraging. In the breeding season, interspecific competition for food seems to be an important factor that affects the niches of these species, especially in northern areas, where the seasonal low phase of voles in spring and the number of alternative prey are lower than in more southern areas.

754,4614,"Distribution, Abundance, and Size Structure of Amur Kaluga Acipenser dauricus and Amur Sturgeon A. schrenckii in the Lower Amur and Amur Estuary","Distribution, population structure, and abundance of Amur kaluga Acipenser dauricus and Amur sturgeon A. schrenckii in the Lower Amur and Amur Estuary have been considered based on the materials of two surveys performed in 2011. Both species occur along almost the entire length of the Lower Amur and in major part of the Amur Estuary. The density of their aggregations has significantly decreased in most regions of the river if compared to the 1960s. In the Amur Estuary, A. dauricus and A. schrenckii are most abundant in freshwater and light salted water bodies of its western part. In 2011, the abundance and biomass of A. dauricus and A. schrenckii in the Lower Amur and Amur Estuary was 345000 specimens and 7110 tons and 289000 specimens and 1946 tons, respectively."
755,3160,"Wintering Waterbird Census in the Azov– Black Sea Coastal Wetlands of Ukraine, Georgia and Turkey","The coastal wetlands of the Black Sea region are important for millions of waterbirds wintering each; year in that region. This attracts attention from ornithologists from the Black Sea countries as well as; from international conservation organizations. The fi rst counts were conducted about 80 years ago, but; they were organised on a regular basis only due to the development of the International Waterbird Census; (IWC). IWC has already quite a long history in the region  it was launched about 40 years ago, and a; lot of data on wintering waterbirds was accumulated due to this. At the same time there is still a need for; further improvement of IWC methodology and infrastructure in the Black Sea region, as well as using; such improvements as a basis for development of monitoring system for migratory waterbirds. In relation; to this in 2009 Wetlands International started the project Stop-over Black Sea: the importance of the; Black Sea region in the migratory systems of waterbirds in the African - Eurasian Flyway, supported by; BBI- MATRA fund. The project is directed at coastal wetlands of three Black Sea countries  Georgia,; Turkey and Ukraine. The main partners of Wetlands International for this project are: Environmental; Association Psovi in Georgia, Doga Dernegi in Turkey and the Azov-Black Sea Ornithological Station; in Ukraine.; The aim of this report is to provide results of gap analysis of IWC in coastal wetlands of Georgia,; Turkey and Ukraine, fi rst of all in relation to current status of its methodology and infrastructure, as well; as to present count data for key coastal wetlands."
756,3990,Trophic Dynamics of the Boreal Forests of the Kluane Region,"The trophic dynamics of the Yukon boreal forest have been under investigation at the Kluane Lake Research Station since 1973. We monitored and conducted experiments on the major species in this ecosystem, except the large mammals (for logistic reasons). The central problem has been to determine the causes of the 9-10 year cycle of snowshoe hares, and to achieve this we carried out several large-scale experiments manipulating food supplies, predator pressure, and soil nutrient availability to test hypotheses that food, predation, or habitat quality regulate populations. The hare cycle is driven top-down by predators, and most hares die because they are killed by predators. Predators also cause stress in female hares, and the stress response seems to be responsible for the loss of reproductive potential in the decline and low phases of the hare cycle. Many of the specialist predators and some herbivores in this ecosystem fuctuate with the hare cycle. Arctic ground squirrels do, but red squirrels do not, being linked closely to white spruce seed masting years. Small rodents fuctuate in numbers in two patterns. Red-backed voles and four species of Microtus voles have a 3-4 year cycle that seems to be driven by food supplies and social behaviour. Deer mice, in contrast, have fuctuated dramatically in the 38 years we have monitored them, but not cyclically. White spruce seed production varies with temperature and rainfall, but was not affected by adding nutrients in fertilizer. Global warming and reduced hare browsing in the last 20 years have helped to increase the abundance of shrubs in these forests. It will be challenging to predict how this system will change as climatic warming proceeds, because even closely related species in the same trophic level respond differently to perturbations. We recommend continued monitoring of the major species in these boreal forests. "
757,4108,What factors determine cyclic amplitude in the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) cycle?,"Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben, 1777) fluctuate in 910 year cycles throughout much of their North American range. These cycles show large variations in cyclic amplitude and we ask what factors could cause amplitude variation. We gathered data from 1976 to 2012 on hare numbers in the boreal forest of Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and northern British Columbia to describe the amplitude of hare fluctuations and to evaluate four possible causes. First, weather could cause variation in amplitude via hare reproduction or survival, but this mechanism does not fit our data. Second, bottom-up processes involving forest succession could explain amplitude variation through changes in winter forage availability, but succession is too slow a variable in our study areas. Third, plant defenses entrained by hare over-browsing in one cycle can produce variation in plant quality and quantity in subsequent cycles. A mathematical model suggests this is a possible explanation. Fourth, predator recovery following the cyclic low is inversely related to hare cyclic amplitude, and the existing data are consistent with this mechanism. A standardized regional monitoring program is needed to improve our understanding of cyclic amplitude variation in hares and the possible role of predators and winter foods in affecting amplitude."
758,718,Synchrony in lemming and vole populations in the Canadian Arctic,"Population fluctuations may occur in synchrony among several rodent species at a given site, and they may occur in synchrony over large geographical areas. We summarize information on synchrony in lemmings and voles from the Canadian Arctic for the past 20 years. The most detailed available information is from the central Canadian Arctic, where snap-trap samples have been taken annually at several sites for periods of up to 15 years. Geographical synchrony in the same species among different sites was strong, especially for the central and eastern Canadian Arctic. Synchrony among different species at a given site was also generally high. When one species is at high density, densities of all species at that site tend to be high. These results do not easily fit the mobile-predator hypothesis proposed to explain regional synchrony, and are more consistent with the weather hypothesis, which we suggest both entrains synchrony among sites and enforces synchrony among species within a site. We tentatively support the weather hypothesis for geographical synchrony in lemmings, and recommend the establishment of a circumpolar program to monitor lemming cycles and predator movements that would advance our understanding of these large-scale patterns of cyclic synchrony."
759,769,Cyclic dynamics of snowshoe hares on a small island in the Yukon,"Snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) populations were monitored from 1977 to 2001 on Jacquot Island (5 km2) in Kluane Lake, southwestern Yukon, and on nearby mainland sites. Jacquot Island hares averaged twice the density of mainland control populations and, although they show 10-year cycles, fluctuate with much lower amplitude than mainland populations. Three separate intensive studies over 6 years attempted to determine what caused these differences. We tested two hypotheses to explain the dynamics. Reproductive rates of hares were similar on Jacquot Island and the mainland. Adult survival rates were higher on the island in most years, with the exception of years of population decline. Juvenile survival rates from 0 to 30 days of life were much higher on the island than on the mainland except for decline summers. The adult- and juvenile-survival differences between the island and the mainland were explained most consistently by predation. Improved survival on the island is correlated with a reduction in the numbers and types of predators found on Jacquot Island compared with the mainland. In particular, red squirrels were rare on Jacquot Island, arctic ground squirrels were absent, and the larger predators, like lynx and great-horned owls, were sporadic in occurrence on this small island."
760,2069,"Population dynamics of a group of lion-tailed macaques (Macaca silenus) inhabiting a rainforest fragment in the Western Ghats, India","We observed the overall population dynamics and number of births and deaths in identified individuals between January 2002 and October 2005, in a large group of lion-tailed macaques in the Anaimalai Hills of the Western Ghats in the south Indian state of Tamilnaclu. The group inhabited an isolated rainforest fragment located inside a private tea/coffee garden. The group size increased from 56 in January 2002 to 84 in October 2005. All females reproduced, and the interbirth interval was 23.18 months. Of the 37 infants born between 2002 and 2005, only 1 died providing an infant survivorship rate of about 97.3%. Although births occurred in all months, most of the infants were born between February and March, and this pattern of births was consistent over the years, indicating a major birth peak in this species. The population growth rate in this unusually large group was found to be higher than even in those groups of lion-tailed macaques that inhabit large and relatively undisturbed rainforest complexes. This high growth rate could be attributed to the availability of abundant cultivated fruit plants including commercial crops such as coffee seeds. The observations provide a perspective for the management of other groups of this endangered species inhabiting rainforest fragments."
761,4262,"An update of the breeding population status of the critically endangered Mariana Crow Corvus kubaryi on Rota, Northern Mariana Islands 2013–2014","The critically endangered Mariana Crow now exists in a single population on the island of Rota, Northern Mariana Islands. Targeted management requires an accurate measure of the population status of this species. In Mariana Crows the breeding population is both the easiest cohort to accurately survey and the most important segment of the population in terms of population recovery. The total number of Mariana Crow territorial pairs was estimated on the island of Rota using a direct count method, and total population size was calculated using a Chapman estimate. From September 2013 to April 2014, 46 crow pairs were found and up to an additional eight pairs were estimated in unsearched areas. The total population was estimated to be 178 individuals. This represents a 10-23% decline in pairs in the six years since 2007 and a 46-53% decline since 1998. This number is also considerably lower than the minimum 75 pairs recommended to maintain a viable population on Rota."
762,3808,Application of distance sampling to estimate population densities of large herbivores in Kruger National Park,"Aerial surveys have been used in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, to count large ungulates since the late 1970s. After 1998, aerial line-transect sampling using fixed-wing aircraft and Distance analyses replaced the 'total' counting method. This paper investigates these methods and three sampling intensities for estimating the densities of nine large ungulate species in Kruger National Park. Estimates suitable for the detection of population trends and making management decisions were decided by examination of coefficients of variation (set <20%, a priori). Despite the likely violation of some key assumptions of Distance sampling methods, analyses gave population estimates with adequate coefficients of variation for monitoring trends in impala, giraffe, zebra, kudu, white rhinoceros, and elephant bull populations. Significant improvements in precision were obtained at higher sampling intensities for kudu, giraffe, bull elephants and white rhinoceros, but these species already had sufficiently precise population estimates for the detection of trends at the lowest sampling intensity (15%). The estimates for warthog, wildebeest and waterbuck populations were, however, insufficiently precise for assessing population trends. Increasing sampling intensity to 22% and higher did not significantly increase the precision of the Distance estimates for these species. Shortcomings in interpretation of the data caused by violations of critical assumptions of analyses are identified and discussed. "
763,4424,Seabird breeding population size on the Antarctic Peninsula related to fisheries activities in non-breeding ranges off South America,"Population growth of the southern giant petrel Macronectes giganteus from South America has been linked with an increase in fishing activities. It was demonstrated recently that a population from Elephant Island, Antarctic Peninsula, largely overlaps its non-breeding distribution with zones of high fishing intensity off South America. This study investigated the assumption that the increase in this population since the 1980s is related to an increase in fisheries off South America. Our results show that the population size is proportional to the increase in demersal and squid fisheries. These fisheries produce a considerable amount of discards, which can be used by non-breeding southern giant petrels as a food source during unfavourable conditions in winter. This may enhance the adult survival rates with potential carry-over effects on population size. Our study shows that we need to further understand the effects of fishery discards/offal on scavenging seabirds of the Southern Ocean, and highlights the importance of understanding the carry-over effects of seabird-fisheries interactions during the non-breeding phase in population dynamics."
764,2512,The return of the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) to northern Germany: Modelling the past to predict the future,"Linking age-specific vital rates to population growth through demographic matrix models can enhance; our understanding of crucial population processes, vital in a conservation context. The white-tailed eagle; (Haliaeetus albicilla) population in the Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, has been monitored; since re-colonisation in 1947 and provides a well-documented example of a recovery. We test how demographic; models capture growth trajectories of a recovering population and how applicable they are in; guiding population management of endangered species. From 1947 to 1974, the population was stable; but the growth rate predicted by an age-structured matrix model was 6.1% per annum. The small; but stable population must have been maintained by immigration. From 1975 to 2008, observed and predicted; population growths were very similar (6.7% and 4% per annum respectively). Elasticity and lifestage; simulation analyses identified adult and pre-breeding survival as key vital rate elements. While; the prospective analyses identified survival as the key vital rate influencing population growth, the; increasing reproduction rate allowed the recovery to take place; thus caution is needed when prospective; modelling makes management recommendations. Nevertheless, conservation efforts should address key; mortality factors such as lead poisoning and collision with wind turbines. A logistic model predicted a; maximum carrying capacity of 255 pairs for the Federal State, but using the highest currently observed; density (1.4 pairs per 100 km2) and differences in habitat suitability, a more likely carrying capacity was; estimated at 122 pairs. Under both scenarios, current population growth should slow soon."
765,1368,Habitat heterogeneity affects population growth in goshawk Accipiter gentilis,"1. The concept of site-dependent population regulation combines the ideas of Ideal Free Distribution-type of habitat settlement and density dependence in a vital rate mediated by habitat heterogeneity. The latter is also known as habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Site-dependent population regulation hypothesis predicts that increasing population density should lead to inhabitation of increasingly poor territories and decreasing per capita population growth rate. An alternative mechanism for population regulation in a territorial breeding system is interference competition. However, this would be expected to cause a more even decrease in individual success with increasing density than site-dependent regulation. 2. We tested these ideas using long-term (1975-99) population data from a goshawk Accipiter gentilis population in Eastern Westphalia, Germany. 3. Goshawk territory occupancy patterns and reproduction parameters support predictions of site-dependent population regulation: territories that were occupied more often and earlier had a higher mean brood size. Fecundity did not decrease with increasing density in best territories. 4. Using time-series modelling, we also showed that the most parsimonious model explaining per capita population growth rate included annual mean habitat quality, weather during the chick rearing and autumn period and density as variables. This model explained 63% of the variation in per capita growth rate. The need for including habitat quality in the time-series model provides further support for the idea of site-dependent population regulation in goshawk."
766,1488,"Rodent assemblage in a habitat mosaic within the Valley Thicket vegetation of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa","We sampled small mammal assemblage in a mosaic of Valley Thicket vegetation in the Great Fish River Reserve during the summers of 2001 and 2002. Assemblage was dominated by seven rodent species with a single nonrodent species (Elephantulus edwardii) in the 357 trapped specimens. Rhabdomys dilectus was the most abundant in both years, followed by Mus minutoides (ranking 2nd in 2001) and Mastomys coucha (2nd in 2002). These three species, which are widespread generalists, made up 85.0% of the total rodent catch in 2001 and 74.3% in 2002. Individual species were captured on 2-14 sites of a total of 17 and M. minutoides was the most widespread. The majority of samples consisted of two (ten sites in a pooled sample for 2 years) or three species (ten sites). Significant morphological structuring was found only in two-species samples. Species turnover was high both among sites and between the 2 years. We found no evidence of significant nested structure which would suggest hierarchical sets of ecological relationships among the species. Vegetation structure explained better than species interactions, the population variables in the rodent assemblage. "
767,1282,"Two remnant populations of the roofed turtle Kachuga trivittata in the upper Ayeyarwady River system, Myanmar","The endemic roofed turtle Kachuga trivittata has been extirpated over most of its former range in the Ayeyarwady River system of Myanmar. Only two small remnant populations are known to survive. In a small stretch of the upper Chindwin River K. trivittata persists because local Shan villages traditionally ban the killing of large adult K. trivittata. The population has nevertheless declined dramatically during the last few years because of the erosion of the ban by migrant fishermen from central Myanmar who do not observe the local regulation, and because of the overexploitation of eggs. The traditional regulation of the Shan villages offers a basis, through its reinforcement and education of migrants, for a species recovery programme. Further actions will include the protection of nests and eggs, and eventually the banning of camps and seasonal settlements on sandbanks used by K. trivittata for nesting. K. trivittata also still persists in the Dokhtawady River in a small area subjected to low exploitation pressure in the recent past because of the dangers of a frontline between the government army and an army of insurgents. The opening of this area following a truce brought this population close to extinction and a hydroelectric dam under construction will alter the ecology of this stretch of river. We propose to assess the potential use of the future impoundment lake for the recovery of this K. trivittata population. "
768,3526,Egg laying duration in the olive ridley turtle Lepidochelys olivacea and its relevance for the estimation of mass nesting population size,"The olive ridley sea turtle Lepidochelys olivacea is known for its unusual behaviour of locally nesting en masse in the eastern Pacific and the east coast of India, leading to difficulties in quantifying population size. In the present study we estimate nesting population sizes in the state of Orissa, taking average egg laying or oviposition duration (OD) into account. We observed 182 and 263 nesting turtles during mass nesting events of 2009 and 2010 to estimate ODs of 19.8±5.8 and 17.2±5.9 minutes, respectively. Clutch size averaged 123.1±10.5 for 2009 and 124.3±18.6 for 2010, which is 10 to 20% more than the global clutch size of 100-110 eggs, and appears to have resulted in a longer OD than previously assumed. Using the average OD from this study, 172,407±7509 and 134,478±6204 turtles were estimated to have nested during 2009 and 2010 respectively, contrasting the 200,000-250,000 turtles reported by the Forest Department. Our results suggest that a minimum of 150 egg laying turtles across each night of the mass nesting period is required to be observed for an accurate quantification of OD."
769,2370,Population trends of common birds in Estonia in 1983-2010,"The paper presents the set-up and development of a common bird monitoring scheme in Estonia in 1983-2010. The point-count survey of widespread terrestrial bird species was undertaken to measure long-term population changes and to produce indicators of the condition of habitat types and the wider environment. The scheme has been mostly run by skilled volunteers of the Estonian Ornithological Society. The method applied is point counting on freechoice routes and without limiting recording distance. In the Estonian scheme, each count route consists of 20 points, with 5-minute stops at least 200 m apart. In total, 143 point count routes have been in use by 89 active birdwatchers and professional ornithologists in the course of 28 years. Yearly abundance indices for 87 bird species were calculated using TRIM software. The most evident changes in bird numbers were the declines detected in 1992-1996 among farmland species, and in 2007-2010 among farmland and woodland species. The long-term population trends (1975-2010) in four countries around the Baltic Sea depend on the migratory strategy of bird species. Among trans-Saharan migrants the proportion of declining species was much higher in comparison with short-distance migrants and sedentary species. A marked difference between these countries was found among sedentary bird species - with up to 2/3 of species with increasing trends in Finland and less than 1/3 in Denmark, Sweden, and Estonia. There is a growing interest in using the results of the scheme both at the national and the international scale (PECBMS)."
770,2486,Abundances of red fox and pine marten in relation to the composition of boreal forest landscapes,"1. The effects of human-caused fragmentation of boreal forest on the abundance of red fox Vulpes vulpes L. and pine marten Mattes martes L. were studied by combining the Finnish wildlife-triangle snow-track data (1990-94) with land-use and forest resources data employing the GIS. Two study areas (each 45 000 km2) located in northern and southern Finland were selected for the investigation. 2. The extent of landscape that best explained predator abundance (tracks per 10 km 24 h-1) was the same (about 100 km2) in both species and study areas. 3. The decreasing proportion of older forest and the increasing proportions of young forest and agricultural land in the landscape positively affected track density of red fox. The relationship between agricultural land and fox abundance, however, was characterized by a convex curve peaking at 20-30% of agricultural land. With the habitat classification used, landscape composition explained 26% and 11% of the spatial variation in fox abundance in the northern and southern study area, respectively. 4. The relationship between landscape composition and pine marten abundance was not as clear as in that of red fox. Landscape composition explained 10% and 6% of spatial variation in pine marten abundance in the northern and southern study area, respectively. In both areas a positive impact occurred with the increasing proportion of young forest in the landscape, but in the northern area the negative effect of increasing proportion of agricultural land was dominant. 5. The abundances of red fox and pine marten were not negatively correlated, indicating that competition or intraguild predation by red fox do not determine abundance of pine marten on a landscape scale. 6. A general increase in predation pressure by generalist predators in fragmented forest landscapes has been an intensively discussed conservation problem during recent years. We conclude that the red fox is a species potentially able to cause elevated predation pressure in boreal landscapes fragmented by human activities, but that the evidence against the pine marten is weaker."
771,1486,"Preliminary estimates of population size and capture rates of mature Acanthopagrus berda in the Kosi lakes system, South Africa, using mark-recapture methods","Population size estimates and capture rates by various fishing techniques of mature estuarine bream, Acanthopagrus berda, were determined in the Kosi lakes system using mark-recapture methods. The total population size of mature A. berda was estimated to be 45 257 (95% confidence interval: 31 589-74 429) based on fish recaptured in fish traps and 56 112 (95% confidence interval: 25 505-374 080) using recaptures from recreational anglers. Fish traps were estimated to catch about 5% of the mature population of A. berda annually, while recreational rod and line angling and traditional spearfishing accounted for about 1% and 0.2% of the mature population respectively. Limited mark-recapture data for other species of fishes in the lakes yielded annual capture rates by fish traps ranging from 2.4% to 5.8%. These levels of fishing appear low enough to be sustainable, but evidence from a long-term monitoring programme indicates an increase in overall fishing effort in the Kosi lakes between 1984 and 1996 and a three-fold increase in the proportion of the A. berda population caught annually. However, there is no evidence from available catch per unit effort (CPUE) data that current levels of harvesting of A. berda are unsustainable. This needs to be confirmed through modelling of the A. berda stocks and continued monitoring of CPUE in all components of the Kosi lakes fishery. In the meantime, an increase in fishing effort directed at this species is not recommended."
772,4365,"Modeling environmental, temporal and spatial effects on twaite shad (Alosa fallax) by-catches in the central Mediterranean Sea","Modeling the relationships between environmental factors and the distribution at sea of species of conservation interest can be useful in predicting their occurrence from a local to a regional scale. This information is essential for planning management and conservation initiatives. In this study, generalized additive models (GAMs) were applied to investigate the influence of environmental, temporal and spatial variables on the catch rates of the twaite shad Alosa fallax (Lacepède) by the pelagic trawl fishery in the north-central Adriatic Sea. Presence/absence and abundance [catch per unit effort (CPUE)] data between 2006 and 2012 were separately modeled, and the two models were then validated using a test data set. The most important factor influencing the presence and abundance of adult twaite shads was the spatial predictor (latitude × longitude). Two areas of major shads aggregations were observed, the most important of which being located near the estuaries of three main river systems of northern Italy. The twaite shad presence was also significantly affected by season, the largest and lowest occurrences being observed in autumn and spring, respectively. Among the environmental variables tested, only sea surface temperature was included in both models. Alosa fallax showed a wide thermal tolerance (6-27°C) with preference for temperature around 23°C. The model developed from the abundance data showed a moderate predictive power, whereas the accuracy of the presence/absence model was rather low. Some conclusions on the ecological requirements of A. fallax at sea arising from this study are useful to orient future monitoring and research programs and to develop effective conservation actions."
773,4039,"Fairy Tern breeding on French Island, Western Port, Victoria","Breeding of Fairy Terns Sternula nereis at the two current breeding sites in Western Port, both on French Island, Victoria, has been documented over more than four decades. At the main site, Rams Island, there has been great variability annually in the numbers of Terns breeding but no significant trend. This breeding colony has persisted for over 40 years, which has not happened at any other Fairy Tern colony in Victoria. There are only three breeding records for Tortoise Head. Current management of the breeding sites appears to be successful and this pattern should be maintained. Priorities include continued monitoring of breeding, and control of feral cats and weeds."
774,2013,The impact of disease on the survival and population growth rate of the Tasmanian devil,"1. We investigated the impact of a recently emerged disease, Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), on the survival and population growth rate of a population of Tasmanian devils, Sarcophilus harrisii, on the Freycinet Peninsula in eastern Tasmania. 2. Cormack-Jolly-Seber and multistate mark-recapture models were employed to investigate the impact of DFTD on age- and sex-specific apparent survival and transition rates. Disease impact on population growth rate was investigated using reverse-time mark-recapture models. 3. The arrival of DFTD triggered an immediate and steady decline in apparent survival rates of adults and subadults, the rate of which was predicted well by the increase in disease prevalence in the population over time. 4. Transitions from healthy to diseased state increased with disease prevalence suggesting that the force of infection in the population is increasing and that the epidemic is not subsiding. 5. The arrival of DFTD coincided with a marked, ongoing decline in the population growth rate of the previously stable population, which to date has not been offset by population compensatory responses"
775,2980,Trend detection in a boat-based method of monitoring sirenians: Antillean manatee case study,"Accurate monitoring is a critical step in evaluating the conservation and management needs of endangered species. We evaluated a low cost, effective survey method for monitoring West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus) in Belize, Central America. The objectives for this paper are (1) to evaluate a count-based population index derived from a boat-based survey method, (2) to examine trends in manatee abundance in the Drowned Cayes area, (3) to conduct a power analysis to explore our ability to detect a trend and the ramifications of survey structure on trend detection. We used a generalized linear model to evaluate the impact of environmental conditions on sighting probability and to determine whether the number of manatees observed per 20-min scan changed from 2001 to 2007. We used simulations to determine statistical power - the ability to detect potential declines of 10%, 25% or 50% over 15. years and for various sampling regimes. The number of manatees sighted per scan was not affected by sighting conditions. There was no change in the mean number of manatees sighted per scan from 2001 to 2007. Our ability to detect a trend ranged from 9% to 100% depending on the level of decline, scan duration, number of points surveyed and number of surveys. This survey protocol is a practical and repeatable way to examine population trends of sirenians in similar habitats around the world. "
776,1714,Population Patterns of a Riparian Frog (Rana swinhoana) Before and After an Earthquake in Subtropical Taiwan,"We compared the population dynamics of a riparian ranid frog, Rana swinhoana, before (1996-1999) and after (1999-2001) a strong earthquake. This earthquake caused little disturbance to the vegetation and landscape of the study site but the stream and ponds dried up within a week. Nearly all frogs marked (1002 of 1004) before the earthquake had disappeared after the earthquake. Smaller, unmarked frogs began to appear in stream habitats about 9 mo after the earthquake, and the frog population was much smaller than it was before the earthquake. Population dynamics and temporal and spatial distribution of frogs before and after the earthquake correlated closely with the hydrology of the stream and ponds. The movement patterns of frogs before and after the earthquake were similar, suggesting frog behavior did not change in response to drastic changes in hydrology, and frogs continued to exhibit strong site-fidelity. Following the earthquake, stream water volume was much lower, especially in the summer, which allowed the normally winter-breeding frogs to breed year-round. Results demonstrate that a population of R. swinhoana can disappear suddenly as the result of a natural disturbance. We propose that anuran species that exhibit strong site-fidelity are particularly susceptible to extirpation of local populations because frogs may lack the behavioral plasticity to respond to sudden water depletion.

777,2436,"Estimated inbreeding in a small, wild muskox Ovibos moschatus population and its possible effects on population reproduction","Knowledge of the effects of inbreeding in natural animal populations is limited. Although inbreeding depression is well documented in wild animals bred in captivity, it has been suggested that the phenomenon does not occur in nature. The potentially negative effects of breeding may be of great importance for the survival of small, wild populations. In a small free-living populations of muskox Ovibos moschatus in Sweden, fecundity and longevity have decreased to the extent that the population now numbers only 12 individuals and is highly likely to die out in the near future. It is possible that this decline is due to harmful effects of inbreeding, the extent of which has been estimated using incomplete pedigree data in combination with computer simulations."
778,4593,"Artisanal gill-net fishery catches of the catfish, Schilbe intermedius (Teleostei: Schilbeidae), in two tributaries of the Ouémé River, Bénin, West Africa","Artisanal fishery gill-net catches of the catfish Schilbe intermedius were studied in the Okpara and Zou tributaries of the Ouémé River, Benin in 1999 and 2000. The largest fish caught at the Toué and Kpassa stations measured 26.2cm and 24.5cm (TL) respectively. The success of artisanal fishing for schilbeids varied during the day, with the highest fish catches being recorded at approximately 22h00 and at 07h00 and the lowest between 13h15 and 16h15. The monthly production at Kpassa varied between 9.0g and 900.0g (average 206.3g) and between 3.3g and 17 320g (average 2 603.4g) at Toué. The monthly production fluctuated considerably. At the two stations, fewer fish were caught each month in the second year than in the same months in the first year. Nets of between 10 and 15mm stretch mesh were the most efficient. Above 15mm, gill-net fishing became less effective. Large fish were often taken with gill-nets of 20-30mm stretch mesh. Beyond these mesh sizes, the gill-net yield and catch decreased. "
779,2902,The effects of altered freshwater inflows on catch rates of non-estuarine-dependent fish in a multispecies nearshore linefishery,"In KwaZulu-Natal on the east coast of South Africa, the commercial and recreational boat-based linefishery is the largest fishery accounting for 1235 t (40%) of the total landed mass there. In particular, the Thukela Banks are where most fishing takes place. Numerous developments ranging from dams to inter-basin transfer schemes either exist or have been proposed for the Thukela River, which is the largest of 17 catchments entering the sea in the region and provides over 40% of the mean annual runoff. Exploratory analyses of the relationships between monthly flows and catch-per-unit-effort were performed using spectral analysis and general linear models on a data set comprising 17 years of monthly commercial catch-and-effort data for 140 species and monthly flow data from 17 catchments. Catchments having a significant influence on catches were those providing the bulk of the runoff volume (75%) reaching the sea. Significant relationships existed between flow and the catches of 14 species, which provided over 90% of the total linefish catch on the Thukela Banks. Time lags between flow events (wet and drought periods) and changes in catch-per-unit-effort corresponded in many cases to age at 50% maturity and/or age-at-first-capture of the species concerned. Under a future maximum-development scenario, corresponding to a 44% reduction in flow from the Thukela River, catches of slinger Chrysoblephus puniceus and squaretail kob Argyrosomus thorpei are forecast to decline by 36% and 28% respectively. These two species currently provide over 50% of the landed mass on the Thukela Banks. Some species should respond positively to a reduction in flow, but any increases in their catches will be negligible, falling within natural variability, and will be insufficient to offset losses of other species because their abundance is naturally low or has been fished down to low levels. National legislation requires that sufficient freshwater flows be set aside to protect ecosystems, so these findings have important management implications, as marine needs for freshwater flows have not previously been addressed.

780,2570,"Size and spatio-temporal variations of the Andean condor Vultur gryphus population in north-west Patagonia, Argentina: communal roosts and conservation","Estimations of the population sizes of threatened species are fundamental for conservation. The current estimate of the population of the Andean condor Vultur gryphus is based on limited local counts. Simultaneous censuses of 10 condor communal roosts were therefore conducted during 2006-2008 in north-west Patagonia, Argentina, to obtain a minimum population number, to estimate the size of the local population, and to describe use of the roosts by season and age classes. I fitted the data to two asymptotic models to calculate the population of condors as a function of the number of communal roosts surveyed. In an area of c. 6,300 km2 I obtained a minimum population size of 246 individuals by direct observation, and a population estimate of 296 condors (range 260-332) by applying the models. This population, the largest known of this species, comprises 68.5% adults and 31.5% immatures. Condors had large aggregations in some communal roosts and used the area seasonally, increasing in numbers from autumn to spring and decreasing in summer. Longterm monitoring of communal roosts across the Andean condor's range is essential for the monitoring of this rare and vulnerable species."
781,4615,Testing predictions of changes in fish abundance and community structure after flow restoration in four reaches of a large river (French Rhône),"1. Projects that restore river ?ows can be considered as in situ experiments and should be used to test predictions of the effects of ?ow changes on ?sh populations and communities. However, ?ow restoration projects often lack appropriate monitoring and replication. The Rh^one restoration project has included repeated ?ow changes, in four bypassed reaches of the river, where the increase in minimum daily ?ow varied from minimal change to a tenfold increase. 2. Fish communities (>55 000 individuals of 36 species) were electro?shed at nine sites in the main channels of the four bypassed reaches, for 29 years before and for 510 years after the ?ow restoration. An instream hydraulic habitat model, published before restoration and based on observations of ?sh microhabitat preferences in independent reaches, was applied to the bypassed reaches to predict density changes for 14 species that accounted for 94% of the total ?sh abundance. 3. In the two bypassed reaches where minimum ?ow was considerably increased (?vefold and tenfold), the abundance of species preferring fast-?owing and deep microhabitats increased by factors of 1.9 and 2.4, respectively, whereas the abundance of other species strongly decreased. Predicted changes in density made using the habitat model for these two reaches agreed with the observations at several sites and involved several ?sh species. In contrast, in the two bypassed reaches where ?ow changes were less, the observed changes in density were weak and less related to the model predictions. 4. Hydraulic habitat models predicted changes of ?sh populations and the predictions also explained observed community responses to the changed ?ows. Ten years after the ?rst ?ow restoration, our results suggest that the Rh^one restoration generated perennial changes of the ?sh community structure, reversing community patterns that were observed prior to the ?ow restoration."
782,3090,Conservation status of the buff-breasted sandpiper: Historic and contemporary distribution and abundance in South America,"We present historic and contemporary information on the distribution and abundance of Buffbreasted; Sandpipers (Tryngites subruficollis) in South America. Historic information was collated from the literature,; area ornithologists, and museums, whereas contemporary data were derived from surveys conducted throughout; the main wintering range in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil during the austral summers of 1999 and 2001. Variable; circular plot sampling was used to estimate population densities. During 1999, the highest concentration of Buffbreasted; Sandpipers in Argentina was in southern Bahia Samboromb6n (General Lavalle District) and areas north; of Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon. During 2001, the highest concentrations in Brazil were at Ilha da Torotama and; Lagoa do Peixe National Park. During 1999 and 2001, the highest concentrations of Buff-breasted Sandpipers in; Uruguay were found along three lagoons (Laguna de Rocha, Laguna de Castillos, and Laguna Garz6n) bordering; the Atlantic Ocean. Population densities (birds/ha) of Buff-breasted Sandpipers were 0.1 1 (95% C.I. = 0.04-0.3 1); in Argentina, 1.62 (0.67-3.93) in Brazil, and 1.08 (0.37-3.18) in Uruguay. High turnover rates at survey sites, due; to the formation of large, mobile flocks, contributed to moderately large confidence intervals around our population; density estimates. Nevertheless, compared with historic accounts of Buff-breasted Sandpipers, our survey data; indicate the population size of this species has declined substantially since the late 1800s and contemporary; information suggests the species has continued to decline during the past three decades. Buff-breasted Sandpipers; were found almost exclusively in pasturelands and appear to depend heavily upon intensive grazing by livestock,; which maintain suitable short grass conditions. We discuss the need for protection of critical areas and proper range; management to ensure appropriate habitat remains available for the species, and provide suggestions for future; research needs."
783,182,Wolverines and their prey in southern Norway.,"Wolverines (Gulo gulo) recolonized the Snohetta plateau in southern Norway in 1976-1979 after an absence of over 50 years. This is presently the southernmost part of the wolverine's distribution and the only area where it coexists with wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in western Europe. Other, larger predators in the Scandinavian ecosystem, the wolf (Canis lupus), lynx (Lynx lynx), and brown bear (Ursus arctos), have been absent from the area since the beginning of this century. We monitored wolverine numbers, reproduction, and diet during the denning period and studied the effects of abundance of different prey species on wolverine reproduction. Although there were differences in productivity among maternity dens, the main factor influencing the number of wolverine cubs surviving was the abundance of small rodents (p = 0.0002). Although small rodents constituted the main factor explaining variation in cub numbers, the basic prey during the denning period was reindeer. Hares (Lepus timidus) accounted for a significant but stable part of the diet during the denning period. The wolverine was an important predator on sheep (Ovis aries), but we found no evidence that sheep are an essential part of its diet."
784,2057,Population characteristics of Kemp's ridley sea turtles in nearshore waters of the Upper Texas and Louisiana Coasts,"Entanglement netting at beachfront, tidal pass, bay, and lagoon habitats along the upper Texas and Louisiana coasts was used to characterize spatial/temporal occurrence, relative abundance, size class composition, sex ratio, and growth rate of nearshore Kemp's ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) assemblages in the western Gulf during 1992-98. Nine study areas from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to South Padre Island, Texas, were netted at different frequencies and/or years, with capture operations scheduled for at least 1 week per month at one or more areas. Beachfront habitats near Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana, and Sabine Pass, Texas, received 73% of the netting effort and accounted for 97% of the 429 ridleys captured during the study. Headstarted ridleys comprised 6.8% (29 individuals) of these captures, and all were netted at beachfront habitats. Overall ridley catch per unit of effort (CPUE) among all years and study areas was 0.5 ridley/km-hr. CPUEs at beachfront versus bay/pass habitats were 0.6 and 0.1, respectively. Sabine and Calcasieu Pass beachfront habitats yielded overall CPUEs of 0.7 and 0.5, respectively, while bay/pass habitats produced CPUEs ranging from 0.0 to 0.2. Annual CPUEs at Sabine Pass, the only area netted each year of the study, ranged from 0.2 to 1.1. Ridleys dominated (92%) catches at upper coast study areas. Ridley occurrence at Sabine and Calcasieu Passes was generally limited to April through September, with May through August producing 92% of the sample. December through February failed to yield ridleys at any study area. Recapture rate for 415 ridleys tagged at Sabine and Calcasieu Passes was 2.9%, with the interval ranging from 22 to 364 days. Recaptured ridleys grew at a mean rate of 0.02 cm/day or 7.3 cm/year. Ridleys ranged from 19.5 to 65.8 cm SCL, with 77% < 40 cm SCL. Adults comprised 2.3% of all captures, none of which were mature males. Sex ratio of wild ridleys was 1.3F:1M. Nearshore, neritic Gulf waters along the upper Texas and Louisiana coasts provide developmental habitat to juvenile and subadult ridleys during late spring through summer when blue crab abundance and discarded shrimp fishery bycatch are highest."
785,3972,Long-term structural habitat use of male individuals of two native and one introduced Anolis Iguanidae species on the north coast of Jamaica,"This study compares the perch heights and densities of male Anolis grahami, A. sagrei and A. lineatopus at four localities near Ocho Rios, Jamaica during the spring of 1983, 1987, 1994, 1996, 1998 and 2000. This is the first report of an Anolis perch height study sampling the same study area for a period of almost two decades. The finding of stability over the long-term in this system lends validity to numerous short-term studies. Data analyses included assessment of perch height and densities. Mean perch heights were signifi-cantly different among species during the study. However, there was still significant overlap in this niche dimension in many years of the study. Anolis sagrei is an invader that has integrated into the Anolis community at this locality. Implications of these findings are discussed regarding reasons for coexistence and potential competition between these species."
786,3083,Status and distribution of Pacific Brent Geese Branta bernicla nigricans wintering in Japan ,"Seasonal abundance and distribution of Pacific Brent Geese wintering in Japan were assessed by examining data collected on a monthly basis by the Japanese Association for Wild Geese Protection over six winters (1989-90 to 1994-95). Peak numbers of up to 4,000 Brent Geese occurred at two sites in eastern Hokkaido each October. By January none remained in this area and only 300-500 stayed in Japan at wintering sites in southern Hokkaido and northern Honshu. An examination of data collected during an annual January census by the Environment Agency of Japan suggested that these numbers have changed little over the last 25 years and there is no evidence of a decline. In January and February 1995 we surveyed 717 km of coastline in northern Japan to try and locate the remaining population, but found only another 162 individuals. We speculate that the majority of Brent Geese wintering in northeast Asia migrate in late autumn from eastern Hokkaido to sites in the Korean Peninsula and in China, although during a seven day survey of the southern coastline of Korea in January 1996 we found only 19 Brent Geese."
787,4576,Modeling the fish community population dynamics and forecasting the eradication success of an exotic fish from an alpine stream,"Management actions aimed at eradicating exotic fish species from riverine ecosystems can be better informed by forecasting abilities of mechanistic models. We illustrate this point with an example of the Logan River, Utah, originally populated with endemic cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii utah), which compete with exotic brown trout (Salmo trutta). The coexistence equilibrium was disrupted by a large scale, experimental removal of the exotic species in 2009–2011 (on average, 8.2% of the stock each year), followed by an increase in the density of the native species. We built a spatially-explicit, reaction-diffusion model encompassing four key processes: population growth in heterogeneous habitat, competition, dispersal, and a management action. We calibrated the model with detailed long-term monitoring data (2001–2016) collected along the 35.4-km long river main channel. Our model, although simple, did a remarkable job reproducing the system steady state prior to the management action. Insights gained from the model independent predictions are consistent with available knowledge and indicate that the exotic species is more competitive; however, the native species still occupies more favorable habitat upstream. Dynamic runs of the model also recreated the observed increase of the native species following the management action. The model can simulate two possible distinct long-term outcomes: recovery or eradication of the exotic species. The processing of available knowledge using Bayesian methods allowed us to conclude that the chance for eradication of the invader was low at the beginning of the experimental removal (0.7% in 2009) and increased (20.5% in 2016) by using more recent monitoring data. We show that accessible mathematical and numerical tools can provide highly informative insights for managers (e.g., outcome of their conservation actions), identify knowledge gaps, and provide testable theory for researchers."
788,1467,"Bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. I. Population structure, growth and mortality.","Population structure, growth and mortality of Anchoa mitchilli were evaluated in Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, USA), an estuary near the northern extent of this species' broad latitudinal range. The Narragansett Bay population was dominated by young fish (Age 1 and young-of-the-year, YOY); no fish were found to have survived a third winter. Growth rates were rapid, particularly during the first year of life, and annual mortality rates were estimated at >90 %. A von Bertalanffy growth model fit to length-at-age data yielded parameters of asymptotic length L∞ = 89.97, growth coefficient K = 1.15 and age at zero length t0 = -0.31. Comparison of my results to those of an earlier study from Chesapeake Bay suggests that Narragansett Bay anchovies grow more rapidly during the first year of life, and subsequently attain a greater length-at-age, than their conspecifics at lower latitudes. Latitudinal differences are also indicated by comparison of the weight-length relationships and Fulton's condition factors of Narragansett Bay and Chesapeake Bay data. Narragansett Bay fish seem to be allocating energy preferentially to length versus weight compared to fish in Chesapeake Bay, which may be a reflection of this species' growth strategy at this latitude."

790,1539,Influence of annual variation in food supply on abundance of wintering common eiders Somateria mollissima.,"We investigated how the annual variation in the abundance of wintering common eiders Somateria mollissima was related to the abundance of benthos over 4 yr. The study was conducted at 2 sites, Tuno Knob and Ringebjerg Sand, Denmark, from 1994 to 1998. Benthos was sampled along permanent transects in November, and common eiders counted and localized from observation towers during the winter. The benthic community was dominated by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, with sizes varying with depth. Small and intermediary-sized individuals were primarily found in 0 to 6 m depth, and large individuals exclusively in 6 to 12 m depth. The pattern of variation in abundance of common eiders matched that of the benthos in 0 to 6 m depth, where they were mostly found, but not in 6 to 12 m depth. Based on a bioenergetic model of food consumption, we estimated that common eiders during the 3rd and 4th years exploited between 22 and 64% of the entire benthic community biomass in 0 to 6 m depth, compared to ≤ 3% in 6 to 12 m depth. We conclude that common eiders tracked annual variation in food abundance, primarily related to the presence of small and intermediary-sized blue mussels."
791,739,Dynamics of reintroduction in an indigenous large ungulate: the wood bison of northern Canada,"We document the recolonization of an indigenous large herbivore into its historic range. Eighteen wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) were reintroduced into the Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary of the Northwest Territories, Canada, in 1963. The population subsequently increased in number and range, peaking at about 2400 in 1989; numbers were estimated at about 1900 in 1998. Recolonization occurred through a series of increases in local areas followed by pulses of dispersal and range expansion. This pattern was originally described for exotic species' introductions. Differences in diet and overwinter survival of calves over the bison's range suggest that intraspecific competition for food provided the stimulus for range expansion. For a conservation strategy, the reintroduction of animals into several independent sites in their historic range would facilitate recolonization and achieve a faster spread than a reintroduction into one site followed by waiting for the population to spread as a result of its own density dependent responses."
792,3396,"Shorebird and passerine abundance and habitat use at a High Arctic breeding site: Creswell Bay, Nunavut","Shorebirds and passerines were surveyed at Creswell Bay, Somerset Island, in the High Arctic Ecozone (Canadian Arctic Islands) during the breeding season (June and July, 1995-97) and in August 1995 (post-breeding). The study area, situated on the north and south sides of Creswell Bay, consisted of sedge marsh and sedge wetland in the lowest areas, with shrub tundra dominated by Dryas spp. or Cassiope spp. and sparse herbaceous tundra over more upland areas. Surveys were carried out on 400 × 400 m plots distributed among the vegetation types according to their relative amounts within the study areas (34 plots in 1995; 33 plus 56 new plots in 1997). Eleven shorebird and three passerine species were observed during the surveys. Densities of breeding shorebirds were similar in 1995 and 1997 (37.3 and 33.1 birds/km2), while in 1996 a late spring with heavy snow cover resulted in reduced numbers of birds and no breeding. Shorebirds and passerines were much more numerous in sedge marsh and sedge wetland. White-rumped sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis) and red phalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius) were the most abundant shorebirds breeding at Creswell Bay, and Lapland longspur (Calcarius lapponicus) was the most abundant breeding passerine. White-rumped sandpiper and sanderling (Calidris alba) were the most numerous species present after the breeding period. American golden-plover (Pluvialis dominica), red phalarope, and white-rumped sandpiper showed significant habitat preferences. An estimated 10341 (± 6596; 95% CI) shorebirds were on the north area in 1995 and 14 840 (± 10 744) on both areas in 1997. The estimated maximum numbers over both years of white-rumped sandpiper (6769 ± 3725) and buff-breasted sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis) (908 ± 1169) at Creswell Bay were more than 1% of the species' estimated national populations (1.5% and 5.1%, respectively). This abundance, along with the relatively high species diversity at this high-latitude site, warrants its continued status as a Canadian Wildlife Service ""key habitat site,"" and every possible effort should be made to ensure its long-term protection. "
793,4122,Compounding effects of human development and a natural food shortage on a black bear population along a human development-wildland interface,"Human development and climate change are two stressors that threaten numerous wildlife populations, and their combined effects are likely to be most pronounced along the human development-wildland interface where changes in both natural and anthropogenic conditions interact to affect wildlife. To better understand the compounding influence of these stressors, we investigated the effects of a climate-induced natural food shortage on the dynamics of a black bear population in the vicinity of Durango, Colorado. We integrated 4 years of DNA-based capture-mark-recapture data with GPS-based telemetry data to evaluate the combined effects of human development and the food shortage on the abundance, population growth rate, and spatial distribution of female black bears. We documented a 57% decline in female bear abundance immediately following the natural food shortage coinciding with an increase in human-caused bear mortality (e.g., vehicle collisions, harvest and lethal removals) primarily in developed areas. We also detected a change in the spatial distribution of female bears with fewer bears occurring near human development in years immediately following the food shortage, likely as a consequence of high mortality near human infrastructure during the food shortage. Given expected future increases in human development and climate-induced food shortages, we expect that bear dynamics may be increasingly influenced by human-caused mortality, which will be difficult to detect with current management practices. To ensure long-term sustainability of bear populations, we recommend that wildlife agencies invest in monitoring programs that can accurately track bear populations, incorporate non-harvest human-caused mortality into management models, and work to reduce human-caused mortality, particularly in years with natural food shortages."
794,1610,Epidemic Disease and the Catastrophic Decline of Australian Rain Forest Frogs,"In the montane rain forests of eastern Australia at least 14 species of endemic, stream-dwelling frogs have disappeared or declined sharply (by more than 90%) during the past 15 years. We review available information on these declines and present eight lines of evidence that collectively suggest that a rapidly spreading, epidemic disease is the most likely responsible agent. The extreme virulence of the putative frog pathogen suggests it is likely exotic to Australian rain forests. We propose that exotic pathogens may be responsible for some recent declines of amphibian populations on other continents and that the intercontinental spread of such pathogens is greatly facilitated by human activities such as the thriving international trade in aquarium fish. Our hypothesis may help explain why some amphibian populations in seemingly pristine environments have mysteriously declined."
795,2746,Status of moose populations and challenges to moose management in Fennoscandia,"In the Fennoscandian countries, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, moose (Alces alces) populations began to increase rapidly in the 1960s and have since then been among the most productive and heavily harvested moose populations in the world. At the start of the 20th century, the total annual harvest was <10,000 moose, whereas in 2000, the annual kill reached about 200,000. The winter population was estimated to be about 500,000. In Sweden and Finland, the highest harvest numbers (and presumably population density) were recorded in the first half of the 1980s and in Finland again in the late 1990s and during the beginning of the 2000s. In Norway, the 1990s the decade of the highest harvest numbers. The current regional moose density during winter varies from < 0.2 to about 2 moose/ km2 within Fennoscandia. Locally, the density may far exceed this level in typical wintering areas (e.g.. 5-6 moose/km2). In general, the current densities are lower in the north than in the south and higher in Norway and Sweden than in Finland. The strong increase in harvest and the present high densities are explained by several factors. First, modern forestry clear-cutting practices have provided Fennoscandian moose with prime habitats in the form of early succession stages. Accordingly, the current carrying capacity is likely to be relatively high compared to the situation 50-100 years ago. The current trend, however, is towards less activity in the forest and a decreasing proportion of forests found at an early successional stage. This may increase the food limitation already seen in several populations; i.e., in all three countries, body mass and recruitment rates have been found to decrease with increasing density. Second. the introduction of sex and age-specific harvesting in the early 1970s has increased the general productivity of the populations. By focusing the harvest on calves, yearlings, and adult males, the proportion of productive females, the mean age of females, and the annual recruitment rate have increased. Simultaneously, the proportion and mean age of males have decreased, and in some populations, this has been associated with delayed parturition dates and lower fecundity: i.e., due to inadequate number of males for timely reproduction. Third, mortality other than hunting is low, and only near the eastern border of Finland with Russia has predation by wolves and bears had a notable effect on productivity figures. This situation is about to change with increasing populations of large carnivores in all of Fennoscandia during the 1990s. The management principles have been quite similar within Fennoscandia, although differences in legislation have resulted in national and regional differences in management performance. In general, moose managers take advantage of data collected by hunters during the hunting season (e.g., hunting statistics, number, sex, and age of moose observed) to monitor population development and determine hunting quotas. Moreover, in all three countries, the issues of traffic accidents and damage to forestry and agriculture play a central role in moose management and discussions concerning optimum population sizes."
796,3801,Dynamics of an expanding black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis minor) population,"Understanding population dynamics is critical for meta-population management, especially of endangered species, and also for megaherbivore ecology. We employed complete individual life records to construct census data for a reintroduced black rhinoceros population over 22 years since its founding and investigated its dynamics. Akaikes information criterion applied to scalar models of population growth based on the generalized logistic unambiguously selected an exponential growth model (r?=?0.102?±?0.017), indicating a highly successful reintroduction. No evidence of density dependence was detected, and thus, we could not confirm the threshold model of density dependence that has influenced black rhinoceros meta-population management. Our analysis supported previous work contending that the generalized logistic is unreliable when fitted to data that do not sample the entire range of population sizes. A stage-based matrix model of the exponential population dynamics exhibited mild transient behaviour. We found no evidence of environmental stochasticity, consistent with our previous studies of this population that found no influence of rainfall on demographic parameters. Demographic stochasticity was present, principally reflected in annual sex-specific recruitment numbers that differed from deterministic predictions of the matrix model. Demographically driven process noise should be assumed to be a component of megaherbivore population dynamics, as these populations are typically relatively small, and should be accounted for in managed removals and introductions. Increase in age at first reproduction with increasing population size, as manifested in the study population, may provide a warning of possible density feedback prior to detectable slowing of population growth rate for megaherbivores."
797,3418,"Historic and current distribution patterns, and minimum abundance of killer whales (Orcinus orca) in the north-west Atlantic","This study represents the first comprehensive examination of the distribution and abundance of killer whales (Orcinus orca) in the north-west Atlantic. Based on a collation of sightings data and a multi-year photographic catalogue of killer whales, 836 sighting events have been recorded between 1758 and 2012, with most occurring in the last ten years. Killer whales were most commonly observed during June-September in Newfoundland/Labrador, Canada. Most sightings were made close to shore, although many occurred beyond coastal shelf areas and in water depths in excess of 3000 m. Relatively fewer sightings were recorded on the Scotian Shelf, in the Gulf of St Lawrence or the north-eastern USA, despite appreciable aerial and vessel-based cetacean survey effort. In the north-west Atlantic, killer whales have been sighted both alone and in groups, with group sizes ranging from 2 to 30 whales (rarely more than 15, although an aggregation of 100 was reported 43 years ago). Groups usually comprised 2-6 individuals. Based on photographic records, there are at least 67 identified killer whales in the northwest Atlantic; this is an underestimate, since a large portion of our image collection was not of sufficient quality to be considered in the analysis, and many of the whales do not have easily discernible markings. The discovery curve of newly-identified whales has not plateaued, suggesting that there are more whales to identify. These data allow us to better understand the ecology of these killer whales, and provide a baseline against which population changes and distribution patterns can be assessed. "
798,2326,"Patterns of depletion in a black rhinoceros population in Luangwa Valley, Zambia","Black rhinos in Luangwa Valley, Zambia have been subjected to heavy illegal hunting since the late 1970s. A study population monitored by individual recognition decreased at an instantaneous rate of ‐ 0.29 yr‐1 between 1981 and 1985. Two‐thirds of skulls found throughout Luangwa Valley between 1979 and 1985 were axed, indicating death from poaching. All age‐ and sex‐classes of rhino were equally susceptible to being shot, presumably due to the high market‐price of rhino horn. "
799,2136,Role of the non-native fish Oreochromis niloticus in the long-term variations of abundance and species composition of the native ichthyofauna in a Caribbean estuary,"Changes in native fish abundance (catch per unit effort-CPUE) and species composition were assessed before and after the introduction of Oreochromis niloticus Linnaeus, 1757 (Nile tilapia) in the Caribbean estuary Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM), northern Colombia. Multiple regression analysis was used to relate the abundance of O. niloticus to that of non-native fishes and environmental variables such as salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, local rainfall, and river discharge. Species composition and abundance of native fishes were found to vary with environmental conditions in different zones but on a large scale, overall abundance remained approximately constant over all studied periods. Abundance of the native catfish Cathorops mapale Betancur-R. and Acero-P., 2005 was negatively related to the abundance of O. niloticus, and both varied with salinity. Overall fish diversity varied in periods when O. niloticus was present, which coincided with low salinity conditions. Our findings indicate that environmental fluctuations constrain the long-term establishment of O. niloticus in the estuary and thus its possible effects on abundance and species composition of the native ichthyofauna. However, it is feasible that the arrival of a more tolerant strain of O. niloticus, its future adaptation to the variable environment, or a longer duration of freshwater conditions in the estuary, could favor its long-term proliferation. In such a case, the occurrence of negative impacts on the native fishes cannot be disregarded. This is, to our knowledge, the first study investigating the impacts of O. niloticus on the ichthyofauna of a Caribbean estuary. "
800,3247,Wintering waders on the Portuguese mainland non-estuarine coast: results of the 2009–2011 survey,"Population estimates of wintering waders on the non-estuarine European coasts are largely based on extrapolated; data from relatively small stretches of coast. In Portugal, the previous and only national estimate of waders; wintering on the non-estuarine coast was based on just 7.3% of the coastline. In this study we carried out the; first survey of waders wintering on almost the whole of the non-estuarine coast of Portugal, in order to improve; knowledge on their abundance and distribution and to set a baseline for interpreting future population trends.; The majority (98.5%) of the 198 5 × 5 km UTM squares, covering 1,096 km of coastline, were counted by; observers walking along the shore within ±3 h of low tide during the 2009/2010 winter. 6,866 waders, of 13; species, were counted and we estimate the entire Portuguese population at 7,175. Sanderling (2,8973,027),; Ruddy Turnstone (2,1912,289) and Kentish Plover (581607) were the most abundant species. Highest wader; numbers were found on the north and central (mainly around the Tagus estuary) coasts. The non-estuarine coast; holds a significant proportion of the Portuguese winter populations of Sanderling (83.6%), Purple Sandpiper; (83.3%), Ruddy Turnstone (80.1%), Whimbrel (33.5%), Kentish Plover (17.0%), Common Sandpiper (16.0%); and Eurasian Oystercatcher (15.7%). The study also highlights the international importance of the Portuguese; non-estuarine coast for wintering Sanderling, Ruddy Turnstone and Kentish Plover, as the counts for these; species represent ?1% of the relevant biogeographic populations."
801,4447,Spatial distribution of common Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) as an indication of a biological hotspot in the East Sea,"The minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is the most common baleen whale among several marine mammal species observed in Korea. Since a high concentrated condition of prey to whales can be obtained by physical structures, the foraging whale distribution can be an indicator of biological hotspot. Our main objective is verifying the coastal upwelling-southwestern East Sea as a productive biological hotspot based on the geographical distribution of minke whales. Among the cetacean research surveys of the National Institute of Fisheries Science since 1999, 9 years data for the minke whales available in the East Sea were used for this study. The regional primary productivity derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used for a proxy of biological productivity. Minke whales observed during the sighting surveys were mostly concentrated in May and found mostly (approximately 70%) in the southwestern coastal areas (< 300m) where high chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity were generally detected. Based on MODIS-derived primary productivity algorithm, the annual primary production (320gCm?2y?1) estimated in the southwestern coastal region of the East Sea belongs to the highly productive coastal upwelling regions in the world. A change in the main spatial distribution of minke whales was found in recent years, which indicate that the major habitats of mink whales have been shifted into the north of the common coastal upwelling regions. This is consistent with the recently reported unprecedented coastal upwelling in the mid-eastern coast of Korea. Based on high phytoplankton productivity and high distribution of minke whales, the southwestern coastal regions can be considered as one of biological hotspots in the East Sea. These regions are important for ecosystem dynamics and the population biology of top marine predators, especially migratory whales and needed to be carefully managed from a resource management perspective."
802,2075,Climate and demography of the planktivorous Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus off northern California: implications for population change,"1. We performed demographic analyses on Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus, a zooplanktivorous seabird inhabiting the variable California Current System, to understand how temporal environmental variability influences population dynamics. 2. We used capture-recapture data from 1986 to 2002 to rank models of interannual variation in survival, breeding propensity, breeding success, and recruitment. 3. All demographic parameters exhibited temporal variability. Interannual variation in survival was best modelled as a nonlinear function of the winter Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Breeding propensity was best modelled as a threshold function of local sea surface temperature. Breeding success and recruitment were best modelled with year-dependent annual variation. 4. Changes in the SOI force El Nino/La Nina events, which in turn alter prey availability to seabirds in this system. Demographic responses varied during El Ninos/La Ninas. Survival diminished substantially during the 1997-98 El Nino event, while breeding propensity was affected during both the 1992 and 1998 El Ninos. Breeding success was reduced during the 1992, 1993, and 1998 El Ninos, but was unusually high in 2002. Recruitment was higher at the beginning and end of this time-series. 5. While demographic responses varied interannually, parameter values covaried in a positive fashion, a situation conducive to rapid population change. During the 11 years study period, the Farallon auklet breeding population declined at 6.05 [plus or minus] 0.80% (SE) per year, a cumulative decline of 49.7%. This study demonstrates how climate variability has influenced key demographic processes for this diminished marine bird population."
803,3046,Five-year monitoring of herpetofauna in Woraksan National Park,"In this study, in order to determine how climate change may affect amphibian and reptile communities, we surveyed the numbers of egg clumps and adults of amphibians and the  number of reptiles at eight amphibian and nine reptile survey sites in Woraksan National Park from March 2005 to September 2009. We assessed the relationships among six climate factors (annual minimum temperature, annual maximum temperature, monthly mean temperature, monthly mean precipitation, monthly mean temperature during winter, and monthly mean precipitation during winter); species diversity, evenness, and richness indexes for both amphibians and reptiles; and the number of each species and egg clumps of three amphibian species. First, both the amphibian and reptile species indices evidenced sudden changes in 2007, when climate factors in Korea fluctuated substantially. Second, amphibian diversity and evenness were negatively related with annual minimum temperature. Increased monthly mean precipitation had a positive effect in mountain edge sites, but a negative effect in valley sites. Third, reptile species evenness was positively related with monthly mean precipitation. In particular, the monthly mean  temperature in the winter season affected the numbers of the Dione's rat snake and the Korean tiger keelback snake. These results indicate that amphibian and reptile communities are responding to climate change in a variety of ways."
804,1879,Spatial and temporal distribution patterns of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Indian Ocean,"The spatial and temporal distribution patterns of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the Indian Ocean were studied based on catch data of Taiwanese longline fishery during the period 1985[approximately]1999. We used a geographic information system (GIS) to compile a fishery database to statistically explore the catch per unit effort (CPUE), mean weight distribution, and the relationship between distribution and environmental factors. Results indicated that bigeye tuna were mainly distributed in tropical waters between 10[degree]N and 15[degree]S, although some scattered instances of high catches appeared outside this range. Sea surface temperature (SST) was the optimal environmental factor for predictions of monthly CPUE, but not for the mean weight index which showed a broader pattern. The monthly mean weight index was not correlated with monthly CPUE except in Dec. and Jan. CPUE hotspots generally occurred between 10[degree]N and 15[degree]S, but hotspots for mean weight index were concentrated in the west of this geographical range. Temporal trends of the CPUE and mean weight indices showed regional differences. Most of the monthly mean CPUE values in the 5 ecoregions showed no significant temporal trends, while the mean weight index showed an increasing pattern. The distributional patterns shown by the CPUE and weight indices of bigeye tuna in the Indian Ocean were similar to those in the Pacific Ocean. Given the current population status and the increasing fishing intensity to meet public demand, conservation measures must be considered to ensure a sustainable fishery."
805,3127,Turnover rates of fall-migrating pectoral sandpipers in the lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley,"Knowledge of the length of time spent at migratory stopover sites, or stopover duration, can help biologists; estimate the total number of birds passing through a site, which in turn can be used to estimate population; size. We estimated the stopover duration for 106 radiomarked pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos) in the Lower; Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (MAV) during fall migrations in 2001 and 2002. We estimated time-at-site-after-capture; by tracking radiomarked birds daily to determine their time of departure from stopover sites. We used lengthbiased; sampling and program DISTANCE to estimate stopover duration from time-at-site-after-capture. Our estimate; of stopover duration for pectoral sandpipers in the MAV over all sites and both years was 10.0 days (95% CI; = 8.211.7). Aerial telemetry relocations from 2002 indicated that many pectoral sandpipers used multiple stopover; sites during their migration through the MAV, which suggested that the total time spent by pectoral sandpipers in; the MAV during fall migration, or turnover rate, was longer than the stopover duration. Future research should; focus on estimating the number of stopover sites used by pectoral sandpipers and determine whether other shorebird; species use multiple sites as well. If shorebirds migrating through the MAV stay in the region for a period; longer than the 10 days suggested by the Lower Mississippi Valley Joint Venture (LMVJV) Migratory Bird Science; Team in their modeling of shorebird energetic requirements, then more habitat may be required by shorebirds; during fall migration than the 2,000 ha the group calculated for the MAV."
806,791,Stochastic seasonality and nonlinear density-dependent factors regulate population size in an African rodent. ,"Ecology has long been troubled by the controversy over how populations are regulated. Some ecologists focus on the role of environmental effects, whereas others argue that density-dependent feedback mechanisms are central. The relative importance of both processes is still hotly debated, but clear examples of both processes acting in the same population are rare. Key- factor analysis (regression of population changes on possible causal factors) and time-series analysis are often used to investigate the presence of density dependence, but such approaches may be biased and provide no information on actual demographic rates. Here we report on both density- dependent and density-independent effects in a murid rodent pest species, the multimammate rat Mastomys natalensis (Smith, 1834), using statistical capture-recapture models. Both effects occur simultaneously, but we also demonstrate that they do not affect all demographic rates in the same way. We have incorporated the obtained estimates of demographic rates in a population dynamics model and show that the observed dynamics are affected by stabilizing nonlinear density-dependent components coupled with strong deterministic and stochastic seasonal components."
807,3665,"Density, population structure and activity pattern of <i>Hydromedusa tectifera</i> (Testudines-Chelidae) in a mountain stream of Córdoba province, Argentina","The Snake-necked Turtle (Hydromedusa tectifera) is mainly distributed in the northeastern provinces of Argentina; however, some isolated populations occur in central Córdoba. This is the first report on some ecological aspects of one of these populations. Population density and annual activity pattern were characterized at Toro Muerto Stream in the Sierras region of the Córdoba province, central Argentina. Turtles were hand-captured and sex and carapace length were determined for each individual. Mark-recapture data were used to estimate population density, variation in monthly capture rates, and sex ratios throughout the sampling months. A total of 96 turtles were captured and density was estimated at 218 individuals ha-1. Individuals were captured all year round, but showed activity peaks in spring and summer. This seasonal pattern has also been observed in other freshwater turtles. During the mating season a higher number of males were captured, which suggested a seasonal difference in activity patterns between sexes. "
808,2601,Recent decrease in gentoo penguin populations at Iles Kerguelen,"Several sub-Antarctic penguin populations have exhibited decreasing trends in the last 5-20 years. At Iles Kerguelen, the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) has decreased by approximately 30% over the last 15 years. This decrease is likely to be related to reduced food availability for this coastal species. We discuss this decrease with regard to the impact of overfishing and to the potential effects of climate changes on marine food webs. "
809,543,Destruction of Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems by a rapidly increasing fur seal population.,"The terrestrial environment of Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, maritime Antarctic, is undergoing rapid and possibly irreversible change caused by a natural biological agent. During the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in the number of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella coming ashore on the island during the short summers. It is not known whether significant numbers of seals were present on the island prior to the initiation of commercial hunting in the early 1820s. The impact that the continuing increase of these seals had made on the island's terrestrial and freshwater environments has been sudden and locally devastating. The fragile cryptogam-dominated vegetation has suffered physical damage from which it may be impossible to recover. These seals are also frequenting several of the island's freshwater lakes which are becoming increasingly eutrophic. The long-term implications of this impact are causing serious concern for the future of the lowland terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems on Signy Island if the fur seal population continues to increase.

810,36,The status and management of the Mongolian gazelle Procapra gutturosa population.,"This article presents data on the ecology, exploitation and management of the Mongolian gazelle over the last few decades. The species has suffered a massive decline in its range area, coinciding with the construction of the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway in the 1950s. It is heavily hunted, both legally and illegally. Threats to the species are outlined and recommendations made about the conservation measures required to secure its future."
811,3489,Model selection between traditional and popular methods for standardizing catch rates of target species: A case study of Japanese Spanish mackerel in the gillnet fishery,"Improving existing catch per unit effort (CPUE) models for construction of a fishery abundance index is important to fish stock assessment and management. CPUE standardization research is a rapidly developing field, and many statistical models have been used, including generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs), regression trees (RTs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the popular and influential methods, random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs) have not been used in this field. We evaluate the performance of six candidate methods (GLMs, GAMs, RTs, RFs, ANNs and SVMs) using gillnet data for Japanese Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus niphonius) collected by a fishery-dependent survey (National Basic Research Program of China, NBRPC) in the south of the Yellow Sea from 2006 to 2012. Predictive performance metrics and Regression Error Characteristic (REC) curves computed by 10-fold cross-validation results showed that the SVM provided the best performance among the six candidate models and slightly improved the prediction accuracies compared to RF. However, the traditional methods GLM and GAM were inferior to the other four nonlinear statistical models (RTs, ANNs, RFs and SVMs). In general, RFs and SVMs should be considered as potential statistical methods for CPUE standardization. Model performance was affected by several factors, including data structure and model construction. Therefore, further research should focus these factors to improve model functionality."
812,1004,"A long-term analysis of the declining population of the Egyptian vulture in the Italian peninsula: distribution, habitat preference, productivity and conservation implications","Between the beginning of the 1970s and the early 1990s the breeding population of the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in the Italian peninsula declined from 29 to nine breeding pairs. We analysed the main aspects of the decline of this population during the last 30 years, namely: (1) landscape structure and composition of active and extinct nesting sites; (2) changes in the land use and number of cattle within the breeding range; (3) productivity (1986-1999) of the last nine pairs breeding in the Italian peninsula. Further decline in the breeding population was probably stopped by creating artificial feeding sites and protecting the last nesting sites from direct persecution. Nearly two-thirds of the pairs laid at least one egg per year, and half of the pairs fledged at least one young per year. The mean number of fledged young was 0.99±0.66 per breeding pair, and 1.27±0.45 per successful pair. About 75% of the breeding failures occurred during incubation, and 71% were related to human activities and direct persecution. The nesting cliff occupation rate, percentage of breeding attempts that fledged at least one chick and mean number of fledged young were negatively correlated with the distance to an artificial feeding site.

813,908,Population dynamics of three Neotropical small mammals: Time series models and the role of delayed density-dependence in population irruptions,"It is widely believed that only precipitation levels (through increased primary production) determine irruptions of small mammals in semi-arid areas of western South America. Nevertheless, density-dependent factors may also drive population fluctuations. To test statistically these putative effects we analysed 11 years of population records on three sympatric species of small mammals at two different habitat types in north central Chile. We applied the classical diagnostic tools of time series analysis (the autocorrelation function: ACF) to the observed time series of three neotropical small mammals. We also used simple linear autoregressive time series models to reconstruct the endogenous dynamics of these populations. The analysis strongly suggests that population fluctuations of the three species have an important density-dependent component, with the most irruptive species (Phyllotis darwini, Waterhouse 1837) displaying stronger second order population feedbacks than the other two (Akodon olivaceus, Waterhouse 1837 and Thylamys elegans, Waterhouse 1839). The latter two species showed direct density-dependent feedbacks. We hypothesize that the frequent population outbreaks of P. darwini (and perhaps of other species) in semi-arid regions of western South America, may be the result of population-level (direct density-dependence) and community-level processes (delayed density-dependence), interacting with exogenous perturbations (rainfall and associated primary production)."
814,1362,Numerical fluctuations in the northern short-tailed shrew: evidence of non-linear feedback signatures on population dynamics and demography,"1. We studied a fluctuating population of the northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) in the Appalachian Plateau Province of Pennsylvania, USA, spanning 21 years of monitoring. We analysed the pattern of annual temporal variation fitting both time-series models and capture-mark-recapture (CMR) statistical models for survival and recruitment rates. 2. We determined that non-linear first-order models explain almost 80% of the variation in annual per capita population growth rates. In particular, a non-linear self-excited threshold autoregressive (SETAR) model describes the time-series data well. Average snowfall showed positive and non-linear effects on population dynamics. 3. The CMR statistical models showed that a non-linear threshold model with strong effects of population density was the best one to describe temporal variation in survival rates. On the other hand, population density or climatic variables did not explain temporal variation in recruitment rates. Survival rates were high during the study period. Weekly changes in population size attributable to new recruits entering in the population fluctuate between 21% and 0%, while the changes in population size related to survival fluctuate between 79% and 100%. 4. Two important results arise from this study. First, non-linear models with first-order feedback appear to capture the essential features of northern short-tailed shrew dynamics and demography. Secondly, climate effects represented by snowfall appear to be small and non-linear on this insectivore. The population dynamics of this shrew in the Appalachian Plateau are determined apparently by a strong non-linear first-order feedback process, which is related to survival rates. 5. This study links population dynamics and demography by detecting the underlying demographic mechanisms driving population dynamics. The feedback structure of this shrew suggests the existence of population dynamics dominated by intraspecific competitive interactions, such as aggression, solitary nesting, non-overlapping home ranges and territoriality."
815,3513,The 1997/1998 mass mortality of corals: effects on fish communities on a Tanzanian coral reef,"The abnormally high surface temperatures in the world's oceans during 1997/1998 resulted in widespread coral bleaching and subsequent coral mortality. An experiment was performed to study the effects of this coral mortality as well as the influence of the structural complexity on fish communities on a Tanzanian coral reef. Changes in fish communities were investigated on plots of transplanted corals after 88% of these corals had died. A distinct shift in fish community composition was found, although diversity was not affected. Fish abundance rose by 39% mostly due to an increase in herbivores, which seemed to benefit from enhanced algal growth on the dead corals. Fish abundance, species diversity and community composition were also strongly influenced by the structural complexity provided by the live and dead corals. This suggests that a coral reef can support abundant and diverse fish populations also after the corals have died as long as the reef structure is sustained. "
816,1224,Decline of a tropical montane amphibian fauna,"On the basis of surveys conducted between 1991 and 1996, I report a decline of the amphibian fauna at Las Tablas, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica. I propose that the reduction in the abundance of Atelopus chiriquiensis and Hyla calypsa, the presence of dead and dying individuals of six species of frogs and salamanders, and changes in population sex ratios of A. chiriquiensis and H. calypsa are evidence for 'atypical' population fluctuations. Species with both aquatic eggs and aquatic larvae were most affected (e.g., Rana vibicaria, Hyla rivularis), whereas species with direct development or those that lack tadpoles, such as rainfrogs (Eleutherodactylus spp.) and some salamanders (e.g., Bolitoglossa minutula), do not seem to have declined in numbers. In light of this evidence and in comparison with other declines in tropical upland Australia, Brazil, and Costa Rica, I conclude that environmental contamination (biotic pathogens or chemicals) or a combination of factors (environmental contamination plus climate change) may be responsible for declines in the amphibian populations at this protected site."
817,4007,,"Relative abundance, population structure, habitat preferences and activity patterns of Tapirus; bairdii (Perissodactyla: Tapiridae), in Chimalapas forest, Oaxaca, Mexico. Bairds tapir (Tapirus bairdii); is endangered primarily because of habitat loss and fragmentation, and overhunting throughout its distribution; range. One of the priority land areas for the conservation of this species is the Northern part of its range in the; Chimalapas forest, Oaxaca. The aim of this research was to determine the relative abundance, population structure,; habitat preferences and activity patterns of Baird´s tapir (Tapirus bairdii) in the Chimalapas forest, Oaxaca,; Mexico, through the non-invasive technique of camera-trap sampling. A total of five sampling sessions were; undertaken among 2009-2013, and used a total of 30 camera-traps in each period. The determinant factor of the; sampling design was the hunting between two study areas. A total sampling effort of 9 000 trap-days allowed; to estimate an index of relative abundance (IRA) of 6.77 tapir photographs/1 000 trap-days (n=61). IRA varied; significantly between sampling stations (Mann-Whitney, p<0.01). The frequency of Baird´s tapir photos was; higher in the dry season in tropical rain forest without hunting (x², p<0.5). In the rainy season, the tropical rain; forest and secondary vegetation habitats showed higher photo frequency than expected from random (x², p<0.5).; Considering population structure, a 95.08% of adult animals was obtained in photographic records (n=58). Three; types of activity pattern were observed, with more nocturnal records (88.33%; Kruskal-Wallis, p<0.05). The; Chimalapas forest appears to be the second most important terrestrial priority ecoregion, just after the Mayan; Forest (Campeche, Chiapas, Quintana Roo), for the conservation of tapir populations, not only for Mexico but; also for Central America.

818,4515,Climate-driven declines in arthropod abundance restructure a rainforest food web,"Arthropods, invertebrates including insects that have external skeletons, are declining at an alarming rate. While the tropics harbor the majority of arthropod species, little is known about trends in their abundance. We compared arthropod biomass in Puerto Ricos Luquillo rainforest with data taken during the 1970s and found that biomass had fallen 10 to 60 times. Our analyses revealed synchronous declines in the lizards, frogs, and birds that eat arthropods. Over the past 30 years, forest temperatures have risen 2.0 °C, and our study indicates that climate warming is the driving force behind the collapse of the forests food web. If supported by further research, the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than currently anticipated.A number of studies indicate that tropical arthropods should be particularly vulnerable to climate warming. If these predictions are realized, climate warming may have a more profound impact on the functioning and diversity of tropical forests than currently anticipated. Although arthropods comprise over two-thirds of terrestrial species, information on their abundance and extinction rates in tropical habitats is severely limited. Here we analyze data on arthropod and insectivore abundances taken between 1976 and 2012 at two midelevation habitats in Puerto Ricos Luquillo rainforest. During this time, mean maximum temperatures have risen by 2.0 °C. Using the same study area and methods employed by Lister in the 1970s, we discovered that the dry weight biomass of arthropods captured in sweep samples had declined 4 to 8 times, and 30 to 60 times in sticky traps. Analysis of long-term data on canopy arthropods and walking sticks taken as part of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research program revealed sustained declines in abundance over two decades, as well as negative regressions of abundance on mean maximum temperatures. We also document parallel decreases in Luquillos insectivorous lizards, frogs, and birds. While El Niño/Southern Oscillation influences the abundance of forest arthropods, climate warming is the major driver of reductions in arthropod abundance, indirectly precipitating a bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web."
819,1638,"CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS OF LONG-TERM POPULATION TRENDS, ENVIRONMENTAL CORRELATES AND PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR NAMAQUA SANDGROUSE","Hunting bag data for Namaqua sandgrouse Pterocles namaqua from an estate near Kimberley, South Africa, for the period 1907-1992 were analysed to investigate population trends, environmental correlates and to develop predictive models for population fluctuations. An apparent population decline between 1950 and 1992 may be an artifact of increased sandgrouse dispersion in response to an increased number of artificial watering points on the estate, and in the surrounding area, during this latter period. Peaks in sandgrouse abundance are significantly negatively correlated with December rainfall and significantly positively correlated with March rainfall. Furthermore, annual sandgrouse abundance and March rainfall showed similar peaks at four-year cycles during 1909-1939. Therefore, a rainfall 'score' which takes cognizance of both December and March rainfall is useful for predicting annual sandgrouse abundance before the forthcoming hunting season. However, correct predictions of low sandgrouse abundance were more common than correct predictions of high sandgrouse abundance. These environmental correlates and predictive models are useful for forecasting the annual viability of commercial hunting of these populations. "
820,3056,Demography of a southern population of the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata),"The Spotted Turtle {Clemmys guttata) is declining throughout its range; in eastern North America as a result of habitat loss and collection for the pet trade.; Although the species has been relatively well-studied in the northern part of its; range, little is known about southern populations. We conducted a four-year study; on a population of Spotted Turtles in South Carolina. A total of 44 turtles were; captured: 21 females, 17 males, 5 juveniles, and I hatchling. There was no size; dimorphism with respect to carapace length. However, females had longer plastrons,; greater shell heights, and heavier body masses than males, likely as a result of; the concavity of the male plastron. The adult sex ratio did not differ from 1:1.; Estimated adult population size varied annually from 31 to 36 turtles, and density; was estimated at 0.36 turtles/ha. This information is important for the creation of; management plans to conserve populations across the Spotted Turtle's range."
821,3479,Virtual population analysis of the big eye Priacanthus macracanthus in the waters off northeastern Taiwan,"A length-frequency data set including 9548 specimens of the big eye, Priacanthus macracanthus, from the waters off northeastern Taiwan during the period from 1994 to 1997 was analyzed. Six age classes were identified from a length-frequency analysis and dominant age classes were 3+, and 4+. Instantaneous total mortality (Z) was estimated to be 0.88, 1.36, 1.97 and 1.56/yr for 1994-1997, respectively. Natural mortality (M) estimated from Pauly's equation ranged from 0.326 to 0.373/yr. Age-specific abundance estimated from virtual population analysis indicated that the abundance of 2+ peaked in 1995, 3+ in 1996, 4+ in 1997, and 5+ and 6+ in 1994. The abundance of the 1989-1994 year-class indicated that the big eye stock experienced the highest mortality during the period of ages 4 and 5. Abundance of the big eye stock (for 2+ to 6+) increased from 1994 to 1995 and decreased thereafter. Similar patterns of abundance, catch and catch per unit of effort suggested that the big eye stock might fluctuate periodically."
822,916,Causes of population declines of the Lesser Kestrel Falco naumanni in Israel,"We studied the ecology of the Lesser Kestrel Falco naumanni, a globally threatened species, to identify the factors causing its gradual decline in Israel, in order to stabilize and possibly restore its numbers. Lesser Kestrels in Israel breed in colonies, both adjacent to human settlements (rural and urban) and in the countryside, where they are found especially on cliffs. In this study, observations of Lesser Kestrels were carried out in three different breeding areas: (1) an urban colony in Jerusalem, (2) a rural colony in the Alona district and (3) a cliff in the Judean desert (open landscape colony) about 10 km east of Jerusalem. The number of fledglings per nest in Jerusalem (1.91) was lower than in Alona (2.44) and the cliff (3.16). As this lower productivity was associated neither with the clutch size, with hatching success, which were similar in all three regions (about four eggs per clutch, and 80% hatched, respectively), nor with egg fertility, it probably reflects factors operating during the nestling phase. We suggest that the two main factors limiting food availability and causing nestling deaths in Jerusalem are the relatively long flight distances between the breeding and hunting sites, and the use of pesticides in the city parks and lawns. Stochastic events superimposed on such factors, such as the drought of 1999, which markedly reduced productivity, may cause pronounced fluctuations eventually affecting long-term population persistence."
823,3478,"Seasonal pattern of the coastal fish assemblage in Anegada Bay, Argentina.","The seasonal variation of the inshore fish assemblage of Anegada Bay, North Patagonia, Argentina is described here. Three areas were seasonally sampled from 2007 to 2009 by means of a gang of bottom gill-nets. We found 21 coastal fish species, but species richness and fish number and weight changed throughout the year. The six species classified as dominant have national and regional value for artisanal and recreational fishing and were responsible for the seasonal variation in the fish assemblage. Both cluster and non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses based on fish number and fish weight indicated two major sample groups encompassing spring and summer (the warmer seasons) and autumn and winter (the colder seasons). The fish assemblage had higher species richness, dominance and abundance during the warmer seasons than during the colder seasons in the same years and at the same sites. Water temperature was the main environmental factor structuring the fish assemblage in Anegada Bay. We suggest that partial breeding migration toward the bay during warmer months could explain the seasonal pattern observed. Nevertheless, variation in temperature conditions agreed well with the pattern of seasonal changes, leading to an interaction between abiotic and biotic influences in determining the variability in this seasonal fish assemblage. We conclude that an understanding of species temporal and spatial patterns in areas of high ecological and economic value, as exemplified by Anegada Bay, are essential for the implementation of a management approach oriented toward ecosystem sustainability.

824,3975,Abundance and population trends of mangrove landbirds in southwest Florida,"The avifauna of south Florida's mangrove forests is unique and relatively unstudied. population status of landbirds that breed in these forests is currently unknown, and this lack is especially problematic for species that have North American ranges limited almost exclusively mangroves. To address this information gap, we estimated trends in abundance using data generated surveys conducted from 2000 to 2008 at 101 points in mangrove forests in southwestern Florida. populations of two of three mangrove-dependent species that breed in these forests, Black-whiskered altiloquus) and Mangrove Cuckoos (Coccyzus minor), declined significantly during our study. In contrast, of seven species with a broader North American range (Red-bellied Woodpecker, Melanerpes carolinensis) in abundance. No species increased in abundance. The Mangrove Cuckoo population exhibited the with numbers declining 87.1% from 2000 to 2008. Numbers of Black-whiskered Vireos declined declines coincided with the outbreak of West Nile virus that has been linked to population declines American birds, but we could not rule out other potential causes, including changes in the quality breeding or wintering"
825,3992,Indirect and mitigated effects of pulsed resources on the population dynamics of a northern rodent,"1. Pulsed resources have significant effects on population and community dynamics in terrestrial; ecosystems. Mast seeding is an important resource pulse in deciduous forests; these; boom and bust cycles of seed production generate strong lagged population responses by; post-dispersal seed predators such as rodents, which then cascade through multiple trophic; levels and regulate population dynamics of their predators and prey. However, similar interactions; in another major pulsed system, coniferous forests, are inconsistent, and the effects of; interannual variation in conifer seed production on many consumer populations are largely; unknown.; 2. We used large-scale manipulation and intensive monitoring to examine the population; dynamics of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in relation to fall seed production by two; northern conifers, white spruce (Picea glauca) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Previous; studies have shown that spruce seeds are a preferred food source of mice, while fir seeds are; generally avoided if other foods are available. Therefore, we expected that there would be a; positive relationship between mouse demography and previous spruce seed production, but; no effect of fir mast seeding.; 3. Supplementation of a mouse population using spruce seeds indicated that increased fall; spruce seed availability can enhance overwinter survival and population densities in the following; spring, summer, and fall. However, long-term population monitoring indicated that; mouse demography was not positively affected by spruce mast seeding, likely due to strong; interspecific competition with the North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudoniscus), a; dominant pre-dispersal spruce seed predator.; 4. Conversely, we observed an unexpected delayed effect of fir mast seeding, where increased; fall fir seed production did not influence overwinter or spring mouse demography, but instead; enhanced summer survival, body masses and pregnancy rates of overwintered adults. This led; to increased summer population densities and may have been mediated by population; responses of invertebrate post-dispersal seed predators to increased fir seed availability.; 5. Our results indicate that rodent responses to resource pulses in coniferous forests are more; complex than in deciduous environments and reveal previously unobserved direct and indirect; consumerresource dynamics that require further examination. This system is ideal for the; large-scale, integrative ecosystem studies that ecologists are encouraged to pursue."
826,1720,Long-term numerical changes and regulation in a river stock of European eel Anguilla anguilla,"1. The objective was to explore the regulatory mechanisms underlying the numerical dynamics of a river stock of European eel Anguilla anguilla based on a purely observational study. We used a 21-year data set on the Rio Esva (Asturias, northwestern Spain) stock of eels, encompassing eel density at an estuary site and at nine sites distributed among three tributaries selected to differ in the distance from the tidal limit and fishery data on glass eels from the nearby Rio Nalón estuary. 2. The abundance of glass eels and estuarine and in-stream densities declined simultaneously over a 15-year period. However, following a historical minimum in the abundance of glass eels around the year 2000, the density continued to decline in the estuary whereas density in the streams began an increase that has continued to the present. 3. In-stream cohort mortality rate (Z) varied from 0.0016 day-1 to only 0.0003 day-1 (on an annual basis from 0.57 to 0.099 year-1). The negative effects of intra-cohort and inter-cohort densities on mortality rate emphasized the responses of the riverine stock to compensatory density-dependence. As a consequence, the number of eels surviving to commence the silvering stage was similar in magnitude in the strongest and weakest cohorts. 4. These results suggest that, even if the low abundance of glass eels persists, in-stream density may increase towards a stable value regulated by in-stream density-dependence. "
827,2379,,"From 1909 to about 1980 the eagle owl (Bubo bubo L.) had become extinct in Eastwestphalia-Lippe (North Rhine-Westphalia/Germany); and came back to this region through resettlement projects and several protection measures. to find out how many eagle owls live in the research; area today, which hazards are still existing and what further measures can be taken to improve the status, a questionnaire was developed. It was sent; to 52 persons known as eagle owl experts. the dataset was statistically and graphically analysed.; about 30 years after the first resettlement efforts it can be stated that the eagle owl population has successfully been re-established in Eastwestphalia-; Lippe.

828,4214,Unexpected Decline in a Population of Speckled Tortoises,"Long-lived, iteroparous species exhibit various mechanisms to overcome temporary; unfavorable conditions and promote adult survival and population persistence. Consequently, populations; may appear relatively stable while subtle and slow-progressing threats cause their decline. The speckled; tortoise (Homopus signatus) is a long-lived, iteroparous species in South Africa that is thought to be secure in; areas that meet the species known requirements. To verify its stability, I monitored a dense speckled tortoise; population, integrating 2 mark-recapture studies (20002004 and 20122015) in long-term joint live and; dead encounters and POPAN population models. From 2000 to 2015, the study site remained fenced,; ungrazed, and was not modified in any way, yet the size-class frequency distribution, sex ratio, and abundance; of speckled tortoises drastically changed. Population numbers decreased 66%, mainly because of the; disappearance of juveniles and males. Modeling results identified a reduction in the number of entrants into; the population (via births and immigration) as the likely cause of population changes, whereas apparent; survival remained high. Observations, in part anecdotal, of increasing numbers of pied crows (Corvus albus); on the study site suggest that increased predation on speckled tortoise hatchlings contributed to the; population decline. Examination of rainfall data for 19902015 did not reveal evidence of aridification in the; study area, a documented cause of reduced reproduction in speckled tortoises. The results of this study; caution against the assumption that areas in the range of the speckled tortoise that meet its known; requirements can maintain healthy populations."
829,679,"Dynamics of a Black-Capped Chickadee Population, 1958-1983","The dynamics of a wintering population of Parus atricapillus were studied from 1958-1983. Average estimated population size over this period was approx 160 birds. Average estimated number of new birds entering the population each year and alive at the time of sampling was approx 57. Arithmetic mean annual survival rate estimate was approx 0.59. Hypotheses were tested about possible relationships between these population parameters and 1) the natural introduction of tufted titmice P. bicolor to the area, 2) clear-cutting of portions of nearby red pine Pinus resinosa, planations, and 3) natural variations in winter temperatures. The chickadee population exhibited a substantial short-term decline following titmouse establishment, produced by decreases in both survival rate and number of new recruits. Survival rate declined after the initiation of the pine clear-cutting, but population size was very similar before and after clear-cutting. No evidence was shown of a relationship between survival rate and either of 2 winter temperature variables. -from Authors"
830,3809,"Trends in African black oystercatcher Haematopus moquini populations between the early 1980s and early 2000s, with consideration of the influence of protected habitats and food availability","The African Black Oystercatcher Haematopus moquini is classified as Near Threatened because the population size is small (10 000) and numbers have decreased or were previously recorded as decreasing. Although human activity has increased in many parts of the species breeding range, oystercatchers may be benefiting from an increase in the extent of Marine Protected Areas as well as an improved food supply provided by an alien invasive mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. The study reassesses the global population (last assessed in the early 1980s) and, where changes have occurred, to provide an explanation for these changes. Between the early 1980s and early 2000s the global population increased by c. 45% from about 4 600 to about 6 670 birds. On rocky and mixed shores, the presence of Mytilus and protection status explained most of the increase in oystercatchers. At 41 of the 129 study sites numbers of oystercatchers decreased, most probably on account of movement of birds out of areas that experienced human-induced habitat degradation, rather than unsustainable reproductive rates. Overall, there was undoubtedly an improvement in the species conservation status; given its current status and trends it may soon be possible to change the status to Least Concern on the IUCN Red List."
831,3328,"The abundance and distribution of wolverines in British Columbia, Canada","The abundance and distribution of carnivores and their habitat are key information needed for status assessment, conservation planning, population management, and assessment of the effects of human development on their habitat and populations. We developed a habitat quality rating system, using existing wolverine (Gulo gulo) distribution, wolverine food, ecosystem mapping, and human development data. We used this and empirically derived estimates of wolverine density to predict wolverine distribution and abundance at a provincial scale. Density estimates for wolverines in high-quality habitat averaged 6.2 wolverines/1,000 km2 (95% CI = 4.2-9.5). We predicted mean densities ranging from 0.3/1,000 km2 in rare-quality habitat to 4.1/1,000 km2 in moderate-quality habitat. Our predicted population estimate for wolverines in British Columbia was 3,530 (95% CI = 2,700-4,760). We predicted highest densities of wolverines in interior mountainous regions, moderate densities in interior plateau and boreal forest regions, and low densities in mainland coastal regions and drier interior plateaus. We predicted that wolverines would be rare on Vancouver Island, along the outer mainland coast, and in the dry interior forests, and absent from the Queen Charlotte Islands, interior grassland environments, and areas of intensive urban development."
832,1668,Toward a Synthetic View of Extinction: A History Lesson from a North American Rodent,"Although it is recognized that many factors interact to cause extinctions, it is difficult to consider multiple factors when investigating species declines. I conducted a post hoc exploration of the major hypotheses for the decline of the Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister), incorporated the historical environmental changes that accompanied and preceded the decline, and considered how these events may have affected the species. What emerges is a complicated picture involving multiple, relatively minor stressors, all attributable to human activities. The temporal pattern of the decline is most coherent when considered from a historical perspective. Among the factors that are likely to have affected Allegheny woodrats are two exotic, tree pathogens, a native parasite, the proliferation of human-adapted competitors, and habitat fragmentation. In addition, changes in competitive and predatory regimes appear to have influenced the timing of the collapse. Although the historic record cannot give definitive answers, taking a synthetic, historical-ecological approach can enhance understanding of species declines. "
833,2752,How reliable are total counts to detect trends in population size of chamois Rupicapra rupicapra and R. pyrenaica?,"Censusing wild populations and detecting trends in population size over time is an important task in the conservation and management of wildlife. We compared two methods used to monitor numbers of chamois Rupicapra rupicapra and R. pyrenaica in two contrasting populations, and explored the relationship between the sampling effort and the repeatability of the results using resampling methods. One population in the Alps had been stable at a high density for several years, whereas the other population, located in the Pyrenees, was increasing exponentially, following a reintroduction. In both sites, a long-term monitoring programme based on individually marked chamois, allowed us to estimate population size using capture-mark-recapture methods (CMR). In addition, we calculated an index of population size as the mean number of animals observed on a foot transect surveyed repeatedly. We then compared whether trends estimated by each method were consistent. In the increasing population, both the index and the CMR estimates revealed an exponential increase in population size. In the stable population, neither the index nor the CMR estimate revealed any trend in size. Consistent results between the index and the CMR suggest that the index could be used to monitor trends in population size. Resampling techniques, however, pointed out that the index is only reliable when calculated over a sufficient number of surveys per year (10 in the Pyrenees, three in the Alps) and over a sufficient number of years of monitoring (about five years)."
834,3198,"Numbers and distribution of wild geese in the Netherlands, 1984-89, with special reference to weather conditions","The Netherlands regularly hosts entire or large proportions of populations of several species. Taking all species together, at least 700 000-900 000 geese spent part of their annual cycle in the Netherlands during 1984-89. Severe winters did not have a significant effect on population size through starvation or a diminished breeding success in the subsequent breeding seasons. The main effect of such winters was that the cold forced geese wintering east of the Netherlands westward. Depending on the snow situation and the species involved, the northern part of the country was often deserted by geese. The Delta area was then the main refuge. In general, the smaller and shorter-billed geese responded faster than the larger and stouter-billed geese upon the onset of severe weather. -from Authors"

A total of 38 species was observed, compared with 42 in 1983 and 47 in 1986. Abundance of species of the High Arctic, such as Black Brant, Branta bernicla nigricans, Black-bellied Plover, Pluvialis squatarola, and Baird's Sandpiper, Calidris bairdii, decreased, whereas numbers of the Red-necked Phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus, usually associated with the Low Arctic, increased markedly.

836,1373,Using sparse survey data to investigate the declining abundance of British harbour seals,"This study presents an analysis of changes in the regional abundance of harbour seals Phoca vitulina based on repeated aerial surveys of haulouts, and demonstrates the use of sparse data to deliver advice about population status and management. Generalized linear models with negative binomial errors were used to represent these overdispersed data. The shape parameter of the negative binomial distribution was directly estimated from the data where this was possible. Information from time-series of counts where there were few gaps in the data was used to improve the estimation of this parameter in areas where fewer surveys had been carried out. The results show that the number of harbour seals in eastern England has not increased since the end of the 2002 phocine distemper epidemic. There is also evidence of a general decline in most of the large harbour seal colonies around Britain. The populations in the Inner Hebrides were an exception, with numbers appearing to be stable or increasing. Between 2001 and 2006, the population in Orkney and Shetland declined by 40% (95% confidence interval: 30-50%), indicating harbour seals in these areas experienced substantially increased mortality or very low recruitment over this period. The widespread declines, ranging from Shetland to The Wash, suggest that the causes may have been present over a large part of the North Sea. "
837,4383,Changes in Vegetation Cover Explain Shifts of Colony Sites by Little Terns (Sternula albifrons) in Coastal Portugal,"The availability of suitable breeding habitats is an important factor in explaining seabird demographic fluctuations. For ground nesting seabirds, such as Little Terns (Sternula albifrons), an essential characteristic in determining suitability of breeding habitats is vegetative cover. This study evaluated whether the long-term fluctuations (1979-2014) in Little Tern breeding numbers on sandy beach colonies of Ria Formosa, Algarve, Portugal, could be explained by changes in vegetation cover at each sandy beach colony, environmental variability (measured by the climatic North Atlantic Oscillation index), or a combination of both. The percentage of vegetation cover for each sandy beach was calculated from aerial photos of Ria Formosa barrier islands from 1976 to 2012, and related to breeding census data from the same period. The climatic variation measured by the North Atlantic Oscillation index did not show a significant relationship with the number of breeding pairs nesting on each sandy beach colony. A segmented regression model constructed to model the effect of vegetation cover on the number of breeding pairs on sandy beaches found an optimal vegetation cover of around 10% and an overall breakpoint of 42%vegetation cover; the model predicted that only ∼4% of breeding pairs would endure with 90% vegetation cover and none would endure with 92% vegetation cover. Little Terns in Ria Formosa appear to adopt a fugitive strategy, moving their colonies to locations with better breeding conditions in response to the overgrowth of vegetation."
838,2016,Reproductive conflict delays the recovery of an endangered social species,"1. Evolutionary theory predicts that individuals, in order to increase their relative fitness, can evolve behaviours that are detrimental for the group or population. This mismatch is particularly visible in social organisms. Despite its potential to affect the population dynamics of social animals, this principle has not yet been applied to real-life conservation. 2. Social group structure has been argued to stabilize population dynamics due to the buffering effects of nonreproducing subordinates. However, competition for breeding positions in such species can also interfere with the reproduction of breeding pairs. 3. Seychelles magpie robins, Copsychus sechellarum, live in social groups where subordinate individuals do not breed. Analysis of long-term individual-based data and short-term behavioural observations show that subordinates increase the territorial takeover frequency of established breeders. Such takeovers delay offspring production and decrease territory productivity. 4. Individual-based simulations of the Seychelles magpie robin population parameterized with the long-term data show that this process has significantly postponed the recovery of the species from the Critically Endangered status. 5. Social conflict thus can extend the period of high extinction risk, which we show to have population consequences that should be taken into account in management programmes. This is the first quantitative assessment of the effects of social conflict on conservation."
839,2409,"Evolution of the population density of the Lesser Antillean Iguana (Iguana delicatissima) in the Petite Terre Islands Natural Reserve (Guadeloupe, French West Indies) between 1995 and 2002","The ecosystem of the two Petite Terre Islands (a natural reserve of 148,6 ha since 1998, Guadeloupe, French West Indies) is original because it is dominated by a large size vegetarian reptile, the Lesser Antillean Iguana (Iguana delicatissima), a IUCN vulnerable species. A survey of the Lesser Antillean Iguana population was carried on by the AEVA Natural History Society at the request of the authority in charge of the management of this protected area. The main goals of this study were to gather data on the interannual evolution of the population density and to identify possible threats. A line-transect census, based on a method accounting for the perpendicular distance between the animal and the line transect, was conducted annually from 1995 to 2002 (except in 1997). Correlations were established between large declines of the population and two major climatic events, i.e. two hurricanes in 1995 and a long drought in 2001. With an estimated size of 10,000 adults outside the breakdown periods, the Lesser Antillean Iguana population of the Petite Terre Islands appears as one of three largest ones in the world, with those in Dominica and Desirade Islands. These protected islands are thus a quite important place for this threatened species. The size of the population and its location on two protected islands should favour studies on the biology and the ecology of the species. Hypotheses about the origin of the present population and on the factors that might limit its perpetuity are discussed."
840,3624,Persistence and stability of cichlid assemblages in neotropical floodplain lagoons,"In this study, we evaluated how cichlid assemblages are affected by seasonal and interannual variations in water volume in the floodplain lagoons of the Cuiabá River in the Pantanal wetland. Eleven lagoons were sampled in the early dry season and the early rainy season over a three-year period. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that the species compositions and relative abundances were distinct between the seasons, which indicates that neither persistence nor stability was maintained on a seasonal basis. However, the interannual comparisons show the opposite tendency, indicating strong stability and persistence on an annual basis. These results indicate that the cichlid assemblages in these lagoons have two equilibrium points, one in the early dry season and the other in the early rainy season, and that the assemblages alternate between these points through the hydrologic cycle. In addition to the effect of the water level variation, the abundance distribution is also affected by conductivity and pH, which also influence the total abundance of the species in the assemblage.

841,4259,Poisoning causing the decline in South-East Asia’s largest vulture population,"Cambodia supports populations of three Critically Endangered vulture species that are believed to have become isolated from the rest of the species' global range. Until recently Cambodia's vulture populations had remained stable. However a recent spike in the number of reports of the use of poisons in hunting practices suggests the need to re-evaluate the conservation situation in Cambodia. Population trend analysis showed that since 2010 populations of the White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis and Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus have declined, while the Slender-billed Vulture Gyps tenuirostris may also have started to decline since 2013. These trends are supported by evidence of reduced nesting success. A survey of veterinary drug availability revealed that diclofenac, the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug responsible for vulture declines in South Asia was not available for sale in any of the 74 pharmacies surveyed. However, a poisoned Slender-billed Vulture tested positive for carbofuran in toxicology tests. This provides the first evidence of a vulture mortality resulting from carbofuran in Cambodia. The findings suggest the urgent need to tackle use of carbamate pesticides in hunting. Proposed conservation actions are: a) prevention of poisoning through national bans on harmful carbamate pesticides and diclofenac and education campaigns to reduce demand and use; b) training of personnel in priority protected areas in detection and response to poisoning incidents; c) maintenance of a safe and reliable food source through vulture restaurants to ensure short-term survival, and d) protection and restoration of large areas of deciduous dipterocarp forests to enable long-term species recovery."
842,4582,Responses of coral reef wrasse assemblages to disturbance and marine reserve protection on the Great Barrier Reef,"Coral reefs are periodically impacted by disturbance events that reduce live coral cover and habitat complexity, with concomitant effects on fish assemblage structure. While the density of some fish species may increase following coral loss, most species decline. Determining which species are ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ following disturbances is fundamental to inform projections of future reef community structure, biodiversity, and productivity. Here, we analyse a long-term (2006–2018), spatially extensive (≈ 700 km) ‘natural experiment’ in which the responses of 11 wrasse taxa to acute disturbance events and no-take marine reserve (NTMR) protection were quantified on fringing coral reefs in the Palm (18°34′ S, 146°29′ E), Whitsunday (20°08′ S, 148°56′ E), and Keppel Island (23°10′ S, 150°57′ E) groups, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The responses of wrasse densities to benthic habitat change were taxa specific and temporally consistent. Disturbance-mediated reductions in live hard coral cover and/or habitat complexity resulted in density declines for Hemigymnus melapterus, Hemigymnus fasciatus, Cheilinus fasciatus, Labroides spp., Oxycheilinus digramma, and Thalassoma spp. Conversely, Halichoeres spp. densities correlated positively with increased relative cover of sand and rubble, while Stethojulis spp., Anampses spp., Epibulus insidiator, and Bodianus spp. displayed variable responses to habitat changes. No wrasses exhibited an NTMR effect and predator density, irrespective of NTMR status, only influenced five taxa across all island groups. The lack of NTMR effects and variable top-down predator effects suggest that taxa-specific benthic habitat associations were the predominant drivers of wrasse densities on inshore GBR reefs."
843,3075,Climate change is linked to long-term decline in a stream salamander,"Amphibian declines have been documented worldwide and several have been linked to climate change,; but the long-term data needed to detect declines are largely restricted to pond-breeding species. This; limits our knowledge of population trends in other major groups of amphibians, including stream salamanders,; which have their greatest diversity in North America. I hypothesized that increasing air temperature; and precipitation in northeastern North America caused abundance of the stream salamander; Gyrinophilus porphyriticus in a New Hampshire population to decline between 1999 and 2010. I found; a significant decline in abundance of G. porphyriticus adults over this 12-year period, and no trend in larval; abundance. Adult abundance was negatively related to annual precipitation, which is predicted to; increase further in the Northeast due to climate change. Analysis of a 6-year capturemarkrecapture; data set for the same population showed no temporal variation in larval and adult detectability, validating; the abundance data, and no variation in larval and adult survival. However, survival during metamorphosis; from the larval to adult stage declined dramatically. These results suggest that increasing; precipitation is causing a decline in adult recruitment, which, if it persists, will lead to local extinction.; A likely mechanism for the decline in adult recruitment is mortality of metamorphosing individuals during; spring and fall floods, which have increased in volume and frequency with the increase in precipitation.; More broadly, this study presents strong evidence that the amphibian decline crisis extends to North; Americas stream salamanders, and shows the critical need to collect population data on these species."
844,4556,Matching habitat choice and plasticity contribute to phenotype–environment covariation in a stream salamander," Populations optimize the match of phenotype to environment by localized natural selection, adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and habitat choice. Habitat choice may also be achieved by several mechanisms, including matching habitat choice, where individuals distribute themselves based on self-assessment of the phenotypeenvironment match. Matching habitat choice is a relatively untested concept, but one that could advance our understanding of the interplay of movement ecology and intraspecific phenotypic variation. Morphology of the salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus differs in riffles and pools, the dominant habitats in headwater streams where this species occurs. Specifically, individuals found in riffles have shorter limbs than those found in pools. Here, we used 4 yr of spatially explicit capturemarkrecapture data from three streams to test the contributions of phenotypic plasticity and matching habitat choice to this phenotypeenvironment covariation. We quantified morphological variation in G. porphyriticus with size-corrected principal component (PC) scores and assessed phenotypeenvironment match based on the difference between habitats in these PC scores. We found that both phenotypic plasticity and matching habitat choice contribute to phenotypeenvironment covariation in G. porphyriticus. The phenotypes of individuals that switched habitats (i.e., riffle?pool, pool?riffle) changed to become better matched to the recipient habitat, indicating a plastic response to local habitat conditions. Consistent with matching habitat choice, individuals were also more likely to switch habitats if their initial phenotype was a better match to the alternative habitat, independent of subsequent changes in morphology due to plasticity. Realized performance, survival adjusted for the likelihood of remaining in each habitat, was higher in individuals with phenotypes matched to each habitat than in those with mismatched phenotypes, but performance was generally lower in riffles than pools, suggesting that other factors influence the use of riffles. Our results underscore the value of considering how matching habitat choice interacts with other mechanisms that allow organisms to maximize performance when faced with environmental heterogeneity. More broadly, our study shows that it is important to account for movement in any study of the causes or consequences of intraspecific trait variation, a challenge that may require novel research approaches and experimental designs."
845,4268,Monitoring European wildcat Felis silvestris populations using scat surveys in central Spain: are population trends related to wild rabbit dynamics or to landscape features?,"Background: Accurate data on the European wildcat Felis silvestris population trends are scarce for most of its; range, despite this information being essential in assessing the threat status of the species. Moreover, ecological; correlates of these population trends have never been evaluated. The aim of this study was to describe population; trends of the European wildcat in a central region of Spain during the period 1997 to 2005 on both regional and; local scales. Putative associations with several landscape features and wild rabbit population trajectories were also; examined. Analyses were based on temporal variations of abundance indexes calculated for both species, which; were derived from the respective frequencies of occurrence of scats along linear transects. Moreover, we propose; monitoring wildcat populations across their range using scat surveys.; Results: Results showed that wildcat populations remained stable between the two survey periods considered, and; variations in wildcat abundances were not associated with either habitat features or changes in rabbit abundances.; Moreover, results suggested that wildcat predation does not limit the growth capacity of rabbit populations.; Conclusions: We propose standardized scat surveys as the most efficient methodology for monitoring wildcat; populations across European regions. Problems with genetic analyses for correctly identifying carnivore scats are; noted, which indicate that the best complementary method for monitoring wildcats is probably camera trapping; (especially where hybridization is suspected). Furthermore, results showed that controlling wildcats to protect the; rabbit populations is not justified."
846,2628,"Effects of exploitation by two co-existing fleets on the bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix, in southern Brazil: an application of a seasonal catch-at-age model","This paper describes 20 years in the exploitation of the bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix, in southern Brazil and investigates the effects of the commercial fleets on stock structure. Port samples were obtained from the commercial fisheries based at Rio Grande do Sul for the period 1992-1998. In addition, data derived from the exploitation during the period 1977-1983 (Krug and Haimovici 1991) were included in this analysis. A statistical catch-at-age model is proposed to estimate population size and exploitation rates for both periods of study. This model incorporates both the seasonal characteristic and multi-fleet nature of the P. saltatrix fishery. During the most recent time period, fishery mortality has increased and spawning stock biomass has reduced in comparison to the earlier period 1977-1983. Currently, the exploitation of P. saltatrix relies on fish of all age classes. Adults have been intensively exploited and juveniles may not be abundant enough to maintain the stock at the current high level of exploitation. Management options for the stock are presented based on a redistribution of effort between fleets. Simulations indicate that a ban on fishing in shallow waters for either one or both gears would restore the level of spawning stock biomass."
847,4231,Decline or stability of obligate freshwater elasmobranchs following high fishing pressure,"Despite elasmobranchs are a predominantly marine taxon, several species of sharks and rays are regularly found in fresh water. Although there is ample evidence of declining elasmobranch populations around the world, this evidence comes exclusively from marine and euryhaline species; the ecology and conservation status of obligate freshwater elasmobranchs is far from being understood. River stingrays (Potamotrygoninae, 32 species) live exclusively in South American rivers and represent the overwhelming majority of freshwater elasmobranch diversity. Here, we present evidence of a decline in the abundance of river stingrays in the middle and lower Paraná River, an extensive wetland mosaic of approximately 35,000 km2. By taking advantage of a stingray-manipulation procedure widespread among South American fishermen, we were able to estimate spatial differences in relative fishing pressure and found that the observed decline is related to fishing pressure. The highest fishing effort and lowest relative abundance occurred in areas where fisheries operate on the river floodplain. The lowest fishing effort and highest relative abundances occurred in areas where fisheries operate in the main channel. The only species with a stable trend was Potamotrygon motoro. This evidence confirms the long-presumed vulnerability of obligate freshwater elasmobranchs and suggests that some species, e.g. P. motoro, can be exploited sustainably. Our results also indicate that negative effects on freshwater elasmobranchs can be minimized by adjusting fishing grounds."
848,2824,Long-term population dynamics in a Mediterranean aquatic snake,"A review of several long-term studies has recently suggested that snakes might be declining in large parts of the world. Additional data from other long-term studies are therefore urgently needed in order to assess the generalities of such suggested declines. Based on a 20-year study, we analyzed demographic data on adult dice snakes (Natrix tessellata) studied in central Italy between 1985 and 2004. Both male and female dice snakes were relatively long-lived, with no significant differences in longevity between the sexes. Individual males and females were observed over a maximum of 10 and 14 years, respectively. However, the among-year recapture rates between the year the snakes were initially captured and the subsequent year (i.e., year 1 to year 2) was significantly lower (45%) than the among-year recapture rates during subsequent years (74%; i.e., year 2 to year 3), suggesting that a large proportion of the snakes at first capture were in fact not resident within our study area, and hence many snakes were migrating in and out of our 2-km stream study site, with no inter-sexual difference in dispersal rates. Sex ratio was virtually equal if we consider the study period as a whole. Significant annual fluctuations were, however, observed through the study. In 1985[long dash]1990, 1993[long dash]1995, 1998 and 1999 the sex ratio was male-biased, whereas in 2000[long dash]2004 female-biased. In terms of both survival and recapture probabilities, model selection showed that Akaike's information criterion favored the model incorporating body size, with the model incorporating year having an intermediate likelihood, and the model with sex included being the most disfavored. Total population number estimates suggest an average 86 adult individuals along the 2 km of stream with only minor annual variations. However, a significant decrease in the number of males occurred during the last 6 years of our study. Thus, further monitoring of this population is warranted in light of the decline of snake populations reported recently."
849,3680,Sighting frequency decreases over two decades in three populations of Testudo hermanni from central Italy,"Sighting frequency of tortoises (Testudo hermanni), standardized by the number of person-hours of field effort, was studied between 1992 and 2013 at three different study areas in central Italy. Although the frequency of tortoise sightings fluctuated substantially across years and among study areas, there was a significant declining trend in all the three areas, with GLM analyses showing also a significant interaction between study area and sampling year. The decreasing trend was higher in Castel Fusano than in the other two sites, with yearly frequency of sightings being independent of search effort in all of the study areas. These trends may indicate population declines, because no other explanations seem plausible. Total rainfall from previous autumn to the study period was positively correlated to tortoise sightings in only one locality. The yearly frequency of sightings of juvenile tortoises did not vary significantly among study areas and across years, thus indicating that simple differences in detectability cannot explain the observed patterns. Summer fires and forest overgrowing seem to explain the tortoise decline in two study areas (Castel Fusano and Oriolo) whereas we were not able to identify any specific reason for tortoise decline in the third study area (Manziana)."
850,3042,Enigmatic declines of Australia’s sea snakes from a biodiversity hotspot,"Declines in the abundance of marine vertebrates are of considerable concern, especially when they occur; in isolated locations relatively protected from most major anthropogenic disturbances. This paper reports; on sustained declines in the abundance and diversity of sea snakes at Ashmore Reef, a renowned biodiversity; hotspot in Australias Timor Sea. Surveys conducted in eight years between 1973 and 2010; recorded the highest abundances (average 4246 snakes day1) and species richness (nine species) in; 1973 and 1994. In 2002 abundance had declined by more than 50% (21 snakes day1) and only five species; were recorded. Since 2005 abundances have been consistently low (17 snakes day1), with just two; species, Aipysurus laevis and Emydocephalus annulatus, recorded in significant numbers. Despite extensive; searches since 2005 (especially in 2010) five species of sea snake historically abundant at Ashmore Reef; have not been sighted and are presumed to have become locally extinct. These species include three; Timor Sea endemics Aipysurus apraefrontalis, Aipysurus foliosquama, Aipysurus fuscus, and one Australasian; endemic Aipysurus duboisii. Declines in the abundance and diversity of sea snakes at Ashmore Reef cannot; be attributed to differences in survey methods among years. Ashmore Reef was declared a National Nature; Reserve (IUCN Category 1a) in 1983 and, although the causes for the declines are not known, this protection; has not prevented their occurrence. We discuss possible causes for these enigmatic declines; however, in order to implement effective management strategies, studies are needed to determine; why sea snakes have disappeared from Ashmore Reef."
851,3502,"Distribution, numbers and breeding of birds at the northern ice-free areas of Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, 1990-1992.","Bird populations were surveyed at the northern ice-free areas of Nelson Island (South Shetland Is.) from December 1990 to May 1992. Seasonal variation in abundance of individual species was evaluated by means of regular censuses along the coastline. The approximate number of breeding pairs for 10 species were: Chinstrap Penguin Pygoscelis antarctica (800), Southern Giant Petrel Macronectes giganteus (40), Pintado or Cape Petrel Daption capense (1300), Wilson's Storm Petrel Oceanites oceanicus (100-500), Black-bellied Storm Petrel Fregetta tropica (10), Greater Sheathbill Chionis alba (2), Subantarctic Skua Catharacta antarctica (12), South Polar Skua C. maccormicki (21), Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus (10), and Antarctic Tern Sterna vittata (100). Species composition of breeding birds has not changed since 1984/85, whereas the higher abundance of some species likely reflects an increased observer effort. Breeding of Antarctic Terns, Kelp Gulls and South Polar Skuas was delayed after the harsh winter of 1991. Compared to earlier studies, no differences were found in clutch size, egg size or breeding success. Thirteen non-breeding species were recorded."
852,374,The status and prospects for conservation of the mongolian saiga Saiga tatarica mongolica.,"Data are presented on the changes in distribution and abundance of the Mongolian saiga Saiga tatarica mongolica in the last few decades, based on an analysis of the literature and the authors' field observations. The subspecies has suffered a considerable decline in its range because of hunting and competition with domesticated stock. In 1997 a survey was made of almost all the known range, which consists of two disjunct areas and covers a total of 2200 sq km. A total of 609 animals was recorded and analysis of the census results suggests that c. 1300 saiga remain in total. The authors recommend strengthening the nature reserve established in 1993 in the Shargyn Gobi, and creating several sanctuaries outside this area, where Mongolian saiga from the main remaining population could be reintroduced. These measures would enhance prospects for the survival of this endemic subspecies of the semideserts of western Mongolia."
853,2493,"Fur snagging as a method of evaluating the presence and abundance of a small carnivore, the pine marten (Martes martes)","The pine marten Martes martes was once considered one of Ireland's rarest carnivores, but is now recolonizing many of the areas where it was once extirpated. It is important to monitor its population expansion so that conservation management decisions can be made regarding the status of this species. In this study, we investigate the use of fur snagging devices as a method of estimating pine marten presence and abundance in lowland and upland broadleaf woodland. We investigated whether these devices reliably detected presence, and how quickly. It was found that hair traps functioned very well in detecting pine martens on all survey transects and was essential in their detection in the most isolated site. A survey length of 6 days was sufficient to detect pine marten in all survey sites, with most detections occurring within the first 4 days. The hair traps functioned equally well as scat location for detecting pine marten and had the added advantage of there being no confusion as to the origin of the sample. Live trapping was used to verify the estimates of relative abundance from hair traps. There was a trend for the number of hair samples per site and the number of times animals were trapped per site to be positively correlated, although this was not significant. Hair traps do provide a real alternative for the monitoring of pine martens in both lowland and upland broadleaf woodlands, overcoming many of the disadvantages associated with scat location. "
854,4158,Abundance trends of highly migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean: accounting for water temperature profiles,"Relative abundance trends of highly migratory species (HMS) have played a central role in debates over the health of global fisheries. However, such trends have mostly been inferred from fishery catch rates, which can provide misleading signals of relative abundance. While many biases are accounted for through traditional catch rate standardization, pelagic habitat fished is rarely directly considered. Using a method that explicitly accounts for temperature regimes, we analysed data from the US pelagic longline fishery to estimate relative abundance trends for 34 HMS in the Atlantic Ocean from 1987 through 2013. This represents one of the largest studies of HMS abundance trends. Model selection emphasized the importance of accounting for pelagic habitat fished with water column temperature being included in nearly every species model, and in extreme cases, a temperature variable explained 5060% of the total deviance. Our estimated trends represent observations from one fishery only, and a more integrated stock assessment should form the basis for conclusions about stock status overall. Nonetheless, our trends serve as indicators of stock abundance and they suggest that a majority of HMS (71% of analysed species) are either declining in relative abundance or declined initially with no evidence of rebuilding. Conversely, 29% of the species exhibited stable, increasing, or recovering trends; however, these trends were more prevalent among tunas than either billfishes or sharks. By estimating the effects of pelagic habitat on fishery catch rates, our results can be used in combination with ocean temperature trends and forecasts to support bycatch avoidance and other time-area management decisions."
855,4555,Transboundary conservation of the last remaining population of the Cao Vit gibbon Nomascus nasutus,"The cao vit gibbon Nomascus nasutus, also known as eastern black crested gibbon, is categorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List and was considered one of the world's 25 most threatened primates. The only known population occurs along the border between China and Viet Nam. Accurate information on population size and dynamics is critical for the species' conservation, but population surveys conducted in only one country may over- or underestimate total population size because the home ranges of cao vit gibbon groups often cross the international border. In 2007 and 2016 we conducted two collaborative transboundary censuses of the cao vit gibbon populations in the Trung Khanh Cao Vit Gibbon Species and Habitat Conservation Area in Viet Nam and the Bangliang Gibbon National Nature Reserve in China. The results showed a population size of 102-110 in 2007, which increased to 107-136 in 2016. Our results indicate that previous surveys conducted separately in Viet Nam and China underestimated the global population size of this species. According to our more comprehensive surveys, the gibbon population is increasing slowly. The gibbons and their habitat are legally protected in both countries. Hunting and charcoal making have not been reported in this area since 2007. As habitat carrying capacity is a limiting factor, habitat restoration is required. However, lack of funding to protect the cao vit gibbon remains a challenge."
856,3979,Effects of uneven-aged timber harvest on forest floor vertebrates in the Cascade Mountains of southern Washington,"I sampled amphibians and small mammals in noble firwestern hemlock (Abies proceraTsuga heterophylla) stands following selective timber harvest and in reference stands from 1997 to 2001 in the Cascade Mountains of Washington. Forest stands surrounded a 25 ha wetland. Selective harvest had large, negative effects on tree density and cover and shrub cover, but large positive effects on herbaceous cover. Harvest effects on the abundance of all forest floor vertebrates (FFVs) were small, negative for most amphibians, and positive for most small mammals. Indices of body condition for species with adequate captures were also similar between harvested and reference stands. Annual changes in abundance of forest floor vertebrates in relation to trends in precipitation and air temperature, however, were much larger than those attributed to timber harvest. In addition, the distance of a trap site to breeding ponds had a moderate effect on capture rates of pond-breeding amphibians. Incomplete descriptions of timber harvest techniques in most studies complicated comparisons among studies and formulating generalizations about the effects of uneven-aged harvest on forest floor vertebrates.Wetland buffer width in this study (ffi61 m) maintained wetland associated species, but longer term (>5 years) trends need study.; "
857,4354,Outbreaks of Ichthyophthirius multifiliis in redtail barbs Barbus haasi in a Mediterranean stream during drought,"In 2008, inland waterways in Catalonia (northeast Iberian Peninsula, Spain) experienced one of the worst droughts recorded in this region in recent decades. During this period, an epizootic of Ichthyophthirius multifiliis was detected for the first time in a Mediterranean stream, with 21% prevalence in a population of redtail barbs Barbus haasi. Environmental features and the fish population in this stream were compared during 2007-2009. Fish density and the average fish size were reduced significantly after the outbreak of I. multifiliis in this population. During 2008, parasitized fish were significantly larger than nonparasitized fish. In addition, a significant, positive correlation was found between parasite load and fish size. The origin of I. multifiliis is unknown, but an introduced species detected in April 2007 may have carried it. The combination of stress to the redtail barbs due to suboptimal conditions and favorable environmental conditions for parasite multiplication (e.g., suitable water temperature and low water flow) could have enhanced fish susceptibility to the parasite in April 2008. Further studies are needed to establish the incidence of freshwater fish diseases in Mediterranean watersheds, and water management policies should be reviewed to improve the conservation of native fish fauna.

858,4187,"Whale Shark (Rhincodon typus) Seasonal Occurrence, Abundance and Demographic Structure in the Mid-Equatorial Atlantic Ocean","Whale sharks are generally associated with environmental factors that drive their movements to specific locations where food availability is high. Consequently, foraging is believed to be the main reason for the formation of whale shark aggregations. Feeding aggregations occur mainly in nearshore areas and are composed primarily of immature individuals. Conversely, aggregations of mature adults are rarely observed, and their occurrence is correlated with oceanic environments. Despite an increase in the number of whale shark studies, information on mating and parturition grounds is still lacking. In the present work, we assessed the ecological and behavioural aspects of the whale sharks that visit the archipelago of São Pedro and São Paulo (ASPSP), located ~1,000 km off the coast of Brazil in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Forty-nine whale sharks were recorded from February 2005 to May 2014. The estimated mean ± SD size was 8.27 ± 2.52 m (range: 2.514.0 m) with no significant differences in size across the year. The maturational stages were classified by size as immature (<8.0 m; 32.56%) and mature (>9.0 m; 46.51%); with almost half of the observed animals being mature specimens. The majority of sightings occurred between February and June. During this period, the ocean current weakens and the waters are enriched by eggs and larvae of fishes and invertebrates that attract marine life to forage. At the same time, evidence of reproductive activity in adult females (i.e. swollen abdomen and bite marks on the pectoral fins), and the potential mating behaviour exhibited by one male, suggest that the ASPSP area might also have a role in whale shark reproduction. Irrespective of its use for feeding or reproduction, this insular habitat serves as a meeting point for both juvenile and adult whale sharks, and may play an important ecological role for the species."
859,4356,Population trends of cave-dwelling bats in the eastern Iberian peninsula and the effect of protecting their roots,"Populations trends of cave-dwelling bats in the Eastern Iberian Peninsula and the effect of placing a perimeter fencing around their roosts (to avoid human disturbance on breeding colonies) were evaluated from 1997 to 2014. The species with the highest relative abundance was Miniopterus schreibersii (62.4%), followed by Myotis myotis/blythii (18%), and both populations showed positive trends. On the other hand, Myotis capaccinii (6.2%), M. escalerai (4.8%) and M. emarginatus (0.9%) showed significant, but minor increases, particularly in recent years. Rhinolophus mehelyi (0.2%) displayed no significant trends, while a moderate population decline was recorded for R. euryale (5.1%). Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (2.2%) and R. hipposideros (0.1%) showed positive growth trends. The main assemblages in the evaluated roosts were formed by Myotis myotis/blythii, Miniopterus schreibersii and R. ferrumequinum. This denotes their less specific requirements or greater flexibility when selecting roosts, compared with other species, except for M. capaccinii and R. mehelyi. No significant differences were found between roosts with different levels of protection, but there were positive trends in the protected roosts. Most non-fenced cavities showed negative trends during the period evaluated. We did not rule out other factors, such as requiring habitats with optimum food sources next to maternal roosts, which could affect population growth. The selectivity of some species of bats for certain caves will be essential for the preparation of management plans for certain roosts. Four of the seven risk factors documented for European bats affect studied population. Myotis blythii, M. myotis and Rhinolophus euryale would be most affected by a reduction in the areas they currently occupy."
860,4425,Current and former populations of Audubon's Shearwater (Puffinus lherminieri) in the Caribbean region,"Cryptic species are often difficult to count and thus protect. Audubons Shearwater (Puffinus lherminieri) is a cryptic; seabird that has disappeared from many colonies, but knowledge of the populations status is incomplete. This paper; reviews the survey methods in detail and assesses the status. This species nests or once nested on at least 154 islands; in the Caribbean and remains on 137 today, with most habitat just above sea level. Remaining colonies represent 1%; of the former breeding area and are remote, with 98 sites lacking any estimate of density. In 16 plots searched on; multiple nights using playback, the probability of detection of defended nests was 79 6 5% (57 of 72 defended nests); in a single night of searching. Pairs were attempting to breed in 54 6 6% (39 of 72) of defended nests. Average; densities, adjusted for missed detections, ranged from 0.6 to 246 defended nests ha1 (n¼21 colonies, median¼18.5; ha1, area-weighted mean ¼ 104 ha1). Using the best data from every colony, at least 13,600 defended nests (7,400; breeding pairs) remain. If conservative densities from surveyed colonies occur on unsurveyed colonies, then about; 37,900 defended nests (20,500 breeding pairs) should exist. Assuming shearwaters nested on the known extirpated; sites in lower densities compared to surveyed colonies, populations were at least 446,000 and potentially .2,000,000; defended nests. Uncertainty in current population estimates could be reduced by surveying the largest unsurveyed; colonies first. Audubons Shearwater could be used as an indicator of island and marine ecosystem health with the; caveat that the population is a small fraction of its former size. Conservation recommendations include continuing; standardized monitoring, surveying large unsurveyed sites, limiting the rise of sea level, and removing invasive species; from colonies."
861,3705,"Decline in breeding of the great black-backed gull, Larus marinus, and the herring gull, L. argentatus, on Boot Island, Nova Scotia, 1986 to 2010","For over 50 years, Boot Island, Nova Scotia, has supported a significant mixed bird colony: Great Black-backed Gull (Larus marinus), Herring Gull (L. argentatus), Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias), and Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus). In 2002, the largest Great Black-backed Gull colony in Canada was located there. Over the last quarter century, the Herring Gull colony has shown a dramatic and near-linear decrease from 727 nests in 1986 to 67 in 2000; in 2010, only two nests remained. The number of Great Black-backed Gull nests has also declined by 44%, from 1467 nests in 1992 to 819 in 2010. These reductions may be partly attributed to factors external to the colony, such as changes in regional fisheries and better landfill management. However, a more immediate problem may be nest predation and disturbance by American Mink (Neovison vison), Raccoon (Procyon lotor), Coyote (Canis latrans), and Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)."
862,2548,"Changes in the occurrence of common dolphins, striped dolphins and harbour porpoises in the English Channel and Bay of Biscay","Regular monitoring of the status of cetacean populations is essential for conservation, policy and management. By using a passenger ferry as a scientific research platform, this study provides information on seasonal, annual and longer-term changes in the occurrence of three cetacean species along a relatively fixed transect through the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. Data were collected over an 11 year period through the Biscay Dolphin Research Programme (BDRP). Surveys were conducted every month from 19962006 between Portsmouth, England and Bilbao, Spain by a team of experienced observers using standard techniques. From a 0.125 by 0.125 grid, cells were surveyed in each year and where each species was recorded they were identified using a geographical information system (GIS). A rapid analytical methodspecies occupancy (defined as the proportion of surveyed cells that a species was detected in)was used to assess whether there were any trends in occurrence over time for three cetacean species. From this analysis, a significant trend to increasing occurrence of harbour porpoises in summer months in the English Channel was identified. There were also increases in the occurrence of common dolphins in the English Channel in winter months and striped dolphins in the Bay of Biscay in winter months corresponding with a decrease in summer occurrence, across the study period. However, while consistent, these trends were not significant. "
863,4562,Estimation of production and long-term changes in the population of European eel Anguilla anguilla (L.) in an Irish lake,"Monitoring of yellow-phase and silver-phase Anguilla anguilla during their continental life history is necessary for evaluation of stock recovery measures. Eel population data for an Irish lake (Lough Sheelin) were compiled for the period 19932014. Catch data from 2009 to 2014 provided minimum estimates of recent silver eel production ranging annually from 0.79 to 1.84 kg/ha. Long-term changes in yellow eel abundance and silver eel size structure were assessed as part of a fishery monitoring programme. Yellow eel catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the lake (from longline surveys) was considerably higher in the 1990s (52.262.1 eels/100 hooks) than 20022008 (1.915.8 eels/100 hooks). Conversely, during 19932014, the mean size of silver eels migrating from the lake increased significantly (p < .001), from 659 mm to 838 mm. The results suggest that in the absence of direct yellow eel abundance data, interannual variation in silver eel size structure may be a useful monitoring tool for local eel stocks as part of Eel Management Plans (EMP's)."
864,1390,"Wild dog demography in Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park, South Africa","Wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) are highly threatened carnivores, and conservation of their dwindling numbers is needed. Isolated populations contribute little to these conservatIon efforts, so linking populations of dogs is a necessary goal to prevent extinction. I gathered demographic information from a small population of wild dogs in Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Photographs and archive records from 1981 to 1996 were used to compile information on this population. Demographic parameters from the released population were compared with information on wild dogs elsewhere. Most demographic parameters of the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park population were similar to published information from other populations. The main difference was the effect of a single pack on population performance: pack formation was unlikely, unrelated animals were rare, and major losses (emigration and mortalities) occurred. Increasing the number of packs by introducing more dogs would be useful but would be only a short-term solution. Increasing the local population size and artificially linking populations in southern Africa appears to be the only longer-term solution to ensure the viability of wild dogs on the subcontinent."
865,2896,Breeding Biology and Population Increase of the endangered Bermuda Petrel Pterodroma cahow,"The Bermuda Petrel Pterodroma cahow was thought to have become extinct early in the 17th; century due to a combination of hunting by human colonists and predation by introduced rats, cats,; dogs and pigs. However, single individuals were found on four occasions during the first half of; the 20th century, and in 1951 a small population was discovered breeding on several rocky islets in; north-east Bermuda. Recovery actions began in 1962 when the population numbered just 18 pairs,; dispersed among five small islets. Although rats extirpated one of these five colonies in 1967, the; population has grown steadily to 56 breeding pairs in 2000. We investigated the breeding phenology,; productivity and population size of the Bermuda Petrel between 2000/2001 and 2007/2008.; Each year, the birds began arriving in Bermuda around mid-October. They departed on a prebreeding; exodus between 19 November and 14 December, returning after 3256 days to lay a single; egg between 31 December and 31 January. Eggs hatched from 16 February to 26 March after a mean; (6 SD) incubation period of 53 6 2 days, and young fledged from 15 May to 25 June after a mean; fledging period of 91 6 5 days. Between 2000/2001 and 2007/2008, reproductive output ranged; from 29 to 40 fledglings per annum. Mean annual breeding success (62%) was reasonably high; relative to other Procellariiformes, largely due to the provision of artificial (concrete) nesting; burrows. In 2008, the population numbered 85 breeding pairs. Monitoring since 1961 indicates the; population has been increasing exponentially, doubling approximately every 22 years. This rate of; increase, together with the increased incidence of storm damage, is making it progressively more; impracticable to construct sufficient concrete burrows on the current nesting islets to accommodate; all breeding pairs. The vulnerability of these sites to accelerating storm damage and erosion as; a result of anthropomorphic climate change is now the greatest threat to the Bermuda Petrel."
866,3071,"The potential demise of a population of adders (Vipera berus) in Smygehuk, Sweden","In 1999 and 2004, we published reports on how the introduction of 20 males into a severely inbred and; isolated population of Adders (Vipera berus) halted its decline towards extinction. The introduction significantly; enhanced the populations genetic variability, which resulted in a dramatic increase in offspring viability and a; rapid increase in numbers. Unfortunately, recently a new and unprecedented development is threatening the; populations future survival. In 2004 permission was granted by the Swedish Nature Conservation Agency of the; County Administrative Board to build a house and an adjacent 1 m tall brick wall, right across the habitat occupied; by the Adders. The construction of the house and brick wall in 2006 has prevented the majority of the snakes from; undertaking their annual migration within the study area, resulting in an extirpation > 75% of the Adders. This; reduction seriously impedes the future survival of this unique population."
867,4059,Assessing regional populations of ground-nesting marine birds in the Canadian High Arctic,"The Queens Channel region of Nunavut is an ecologically distinct area within the Canadian High Arctic consisting of an extensive archipelago of small, lowlying gravel islands throughout which form several localized but highly productive polynyas. We used aerial survey and colony-monitoring data to assess regional- and colony-level fluctuations in the number of birds in this region between 2002 and 2013. Regional and colony-specific monitoring suggested that common eider (Somateria mollissima) numbers are increasing, while numbers of Arctic terns (Sterna paradisaea) may be in decline. Based on these data, we suggest that even infrequent comprehensive surveys are more useful than annual monitoring at specific sites in generating an accurate assessment of ground-nesting seabird populations at the regional level, and that dramatic fluctuations at individual colonies probably belie the overall stability of regional populations."
868,3493,Contribution of a large no-take zone to the management of vulnerable reef fishes in the South-West Indian Ocean,"A key element of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management is the use of marine protected areas (MPAs) as part of a holistic management strategy. This study, based in the South-West Indian Ocean, evaluated the benefits of area closure to vulnerable fishery species, which have been depleted by overfishing. A controlled fishing survey was conducted seasonally between 2006 and 2011 in the Pondoland MPA on the East Coast of South Africa. The MPA includes a 400km2 no-take zone where all forms of vessel-based exploitation are prohibited. Three endemic sparids (slinger Chrysoblephus puniceus, Scotsman Polysteganus praeorbitalis and poenskop Cymatoceps nasutus) and one widely distributed serranid (yellowbelly rockcod Epinephelus marginatus) were chosen as study species. These are slow growing, high trophic level species, which are prominent on rocky reefs in the Pondoland area and have been depleted by overfishing. Relative abundance was estimated using catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and length frequency distributions were used to determine the size structure of fish populations. The relative abundance and the mean length of all four species were significantly greater in the no-take zone. Over the 5-year study period, CPUE of C. puniceus and C. nasutus in the no-take zone increased as did the mean length of all species, except C. nasutus. This study presents clear evidence that the Pondoland MPA no-take zone is providing insurance against the depletion of vulnerable fishery stocks in fished areas, thereby establishing the basis for the enhancement of adjacent fisheries.

869,1881,"Population ecology of the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) in a fragmented woodland ecosystem on the Island of Jersey, Channel Islands","The Channel Island of Jersey is 116 km(2) but has only 540 ha of woodland distributed in 237 wooded fragments with mean size of 2.5 ha. Despite this, the island supports 300 to 600 red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris, a species that is under threat in mainland Britain from habitat fragmentation, disease and the spread of the alien grey squirrel S. carolinensis. Grey squirrels are not present on Jersey. Between 1994 and 1997, using trapping and tracking techniques, we studied how red squirrels survive on Jersey by focusing on three local populations in sites B, C and S with contrasting food availability. The primary squirrel foods at site B were autumn tree seeds, at site C autumn tree seeds and summer conifer cones, and at site S autumn tree seeds and ad libitum, year-round supplementary food provided by local people. The densities of squirrels in site C (mean over 3 years 0.97 ha(-1)) and site S (1.21 ha (1)) were more than one and a half times that of site B (0.68 ha(-1)), which relied on autumn seeds. Body mass and condition, and early breeding (spring litters) were not affected by food availability although conception occurred as early as November, earlier than in mainland Britain. Less than 50%, of females produced summer litters, and 88% of non-breeders did not receive supplementary food. Turnover rates were lowest and most stable in site B. Annual residency was not influenced by the size of the natural tree seed crop. Cat and road kills caused two out of three reported deaths. This island population seems to remain viable as a result of an extended breeding season and increased population densities in sites with summer or supplementary food. The results emphasize the beneficial effects of extra food provided by local people. This provides a buffering effect against variations in natural food availability, and seems to be important for their long-term survival."
870,2346,Population growth and stabilizing age structure of the tughlaqabad rhesus,"The rhesus population at Tughlaqabad is characterized by (1) moderately high natality, (2) a changing and perhaps stabilizing age structure, and (3) a declining growth rate. Although natality at this site has been high and relatively invariant over a 7-year period, the proportion of nonreproducing juveniles has increased, necessitating a lower rate of growth. The trapping of rhesus for export, which was practiced in India as recently as 1978, may be largely responsible for the changing nature of the Tughlaqabad age structure but this conclusion remains only conjectural.

871,3088,"Aerial survey of emperor geese and other waterbirds in Southwestern Alaska, Fall 2010","This report presents results of the 32nd consecutive, annual fall emperor goose population survey in southwest; Alaska. The 2010 fall emperor goose estimate is 59,924 birds. With the exception of bays near Cold Bay, the south side; of the Alaska Peninsula was not surveyed and a most recent 3-year average of 2,420 was added for the fall estimate. The; aerial survey was flown between 30 September and 4 October 2010 from the Naknek River to Bechevin Bay including; all the north side of the Alaska Peninsula. A USFWS Quest Kodiak (N700FW) was used and a left seat pilot/observer; and right seat observer made observations along coastlines and over estuaries at an altitude of 45m (150 feet) ASL and; airspeed of 200km/hr (110 kts). All species of waterbirds and marine mammals were counted with emphasis on emperor; geese, Pacific brant, Canada geese, and Stellers eiders. Population estimates for Canada geese, and Stellers eiders; within the surveyed area are 28,302 and 33,434, respectively. Two additional replicate surveys of the Izembek NWR; area were flown on 5 October to estimate sizes of the Pacific brant and Canada goose populations. Averages counts for; the Izembek area are 130,091 Pacific brant (n=3 surveys) and 24,592 Canada geese (n=3 surveys)."
872,4270,Apparent resilience of a declining Afro-Palaearctic migrant to forest loss on the wintering grounds,"Populations of long-distance migrant birds are declining but it is unknown what role land cover change in non-breeding areas may be playing in this process. Using compositional analysis, we assessed habitat selection by one such migrant, the Wood Warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, at a wintering site in the forestsavannah transition zone in Eastern Region, Ghana. There was a preference for forest, a habitat that is in marked decline at this site. Annual habitat mapping revealed that the area of forest declined by 26% between 2011/12 and 2013/14, mainly through clearance for conversion to arable land. Numbers of birds changed throughout the season, but despite the reduction in the preferred forest habitat, there was no change in the total number of birds recorded at the site over the study period. The number of birds recorded at a point was positively related to the proportion of cleared land, plantation and, to a lesser extent, dense forest within 100 m. Investigation of the fine-scale habitat preferences of radiotagged Wood Warblers suggested that there was an optimum number of trees, around 66143 per hectare, at which estimated probability of occupancy was 0.5, falling to a probability of 0.2 at 25 trees per hectare. We suggest that Wood Warblers may be buffered against the loss of forest habitat by their ability to utilize degraded habitats, such as well-wooded farmland, that still retain a substantial number of trees. However, the continued loss of trees, from both forest and farmland is ultimately likely to have a negative impact on wintering Wood Warblers in the long-term."
873,3600,"Distribution and abundance of eggs and estimation of spawning stock biomass of anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus (Linnaeus, 1758), in the south-eastern Adriatic Sea","Seasonal distribution and abundance of anchovy eggs were analysed during three scientific cruises carried out from summer 2006 to summer 2007 in the Boka Kotorska Bay, and one cruise in July 2008 in the open waters of the south-eastern Adriatic Sea. Daily egg production method (DEPM) was applied for the first time for estimation of the anchovy spawning stock biomass in the south-eastern Adriatic Sea. The daily egg production was 13-581 eggs day-1 within the bay, and 42-110 eggs day-1 in the open waters. Anchovy egg abundance was highest in spring inside the Bay of Kotor (one of the innermost and eutrophic sub-bays of the Boka Kotorska Bay), which indicates that the conditions for anchovy spawning are very favourable in this part of the Adriatic Sea, even when temperatures are below the optimum. This study has shown that the Boka Kotorska Bay is an area of very intensive spawning of anchovy, and that small-size anchovies live and spawn in the bay, and after spawning migrate towards open waters. The length at which 50% of anchovy were mature (L50) was calculated as 9.28 for females and 9.02 for males. Spawning stock biomass was at a stable level during the period of investigation."
874,4255,The illegal pet trade is driving Madagascar's ploughshare tortoise to extinction,"The illegal wildlife trade is driving declines in populations of a number of large, charismatic animal species but also many lesser known and restricted-range species, some of which are now facing extinction as a result. The ploughshare tortoise Astrochelys yniphora, endemic to the Baly Bay National Park of north-western Madagascar, is affected by poaching for the international illegal pet trade. To quantify this, we estimated population trends during 2006-2015, using distance sampling surveys along line transects, and recorded national and international confiscations of trafficked tortoises for 2002-2016. The results suggest the ploughshare tortoise population declined > 50% during this period, to c. 500 adults and subadults in 2014-2015. Prior to 2006 very few tortoises were seized either in Madagascar or internationally but confiscations increased sharply from 2010. Since 2015 poaching has intensified, with field reports suggesting that two of the four subpopulations are extinct, leaving an unknown but almost certainly perilously low number of adult tortoises in the wild. This study has produced the first reliable population estimate of the ploughshare tortoise and shows that the species has declined rapidly because of poaching for the international pet trade. There is an urgent need for increased action both in Madagascar and along international trade routes if the extinction of the ploughshare tortoise in the wild is to be prevented."
875,1600,Carrying Capacity and Potential Production of Ungulates for Human Use in a Mexican Tropical Dry Forest,"Data are provided on the carrying capacity and potential production for sustainable human use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) in a protected tropical dry forest at Chamela on the Pacific coast of Mexico. In this paper, the carrying capacity was defined as the equilibrium density plus the number of animals removed by predators. The equilibrium point was estimated from the density dependent relationship between the finite population growth rate and the current density according to a logistic model. Annual density was estimated using the line transect method. Carrying capacity estimates were 16.5 to 17.2 deer/km2 and 9.3-9.5 peccaries/km2, representing a combined biomass of 841-874 kg/km 2. A potential production for human use of 2.1 deer/km2 and 4.4 peccaries/km2 was estimated employing the model of Robinson and Redford (1991). The data suggest that, in the protected tropical dry forest of Chamela, the density and biomass of wild ungulates can maintain a similar or greater density and biomass than other Neotropical forests. To obtain an accurate estimation of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), it is necessary to consider predation. From a management point of view, it is important to consider that carrying capacity varies as a function of the rainfall pattern. "
876,3456,Endangered waterbirds at Doñana natural space,"Taking into account data obtained primarily from 1996 to 2008, this paper reviews the importance of Doñana Natural Space for seven species of waterbird declared Endangered: the highest category of threat from a legal perspective in Spain. Marbled teal, ferruginous duck, white-headed duck, bittern, squacco heron, and red-knobbed coot all breed, while black stork has a wintering population. Only the winter population of the black stork showed a significant trend, positive in this case. The wetlands of Doñana Natural Space represent the first or second most important areas of Spain for all the breeding species except white-headed duck. "
877,2124,"An assessment of the recreational fishery in the St. Lucia estuarine system, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","St Lucia is one of the largest estuarine systems in Africa, and attracts thousands of anglers each year. Catch card data from the National Marine Linefish System for the years 1986-1999 were analysed to determine catch composition, catch per unit effort (cpue) and seasonality of catches by recreational anglers. Because not all anglers completed catch cards, estimates of total catch were made using additional data on the number of private boat outings, the number of boat trailers at boat slipways and the number of boats recorded entering the campsite gates during 1992 and 1993. In all, 27 fish families, constituting 55 species, were recorded by recreational anglers. Dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus, spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii, perch Acanthopagrus berda, Natal stumpnose Rhabdosargus sarba, springer Elops machnata and mini-kob Johnius dorsalis were the most prominent species caught in terms of numbers and mass. Catch rates expressed numerically (fish angler-1 h-1) peaked during the summer and early winter. However, in terms of mass, catch rates peaked during late winter and spring, when there were increased landings of large dusky kob. Fluctuations in cpue were linked to salinity and estuary mouth conditions (i.e. mouth closure). Despite annual fluctuations in cpue, regression analysis revealed an overall downward trend for the dominant species (dusky kob and spotted grunter) and a gradual increase for stumpnose, perch and springer, but with the exception of stumpnose, these trends were not significant. Socio-economic aspects of the fishery were also investigated by conducting an independent boat-angler survey. The value of the recreational fishery, in terms of accommodation and direct angler expenditure, was estimated to be in the region of R9 million during 1992. Angler attitudes towards fishing regulations were positive and anglers generally had a good knowledge of the regulations for target species. Based on this assessment, a number of suggestions are made regarding the future management of the recreational fishery at St Lucia."
878,3860,Bringing forward the benefits of coarse woody debris in ecosystem recovery under different levels of grazing and vegetation density,"Restoration projects often do not effectively restore some key biological resources that take time, often centuries, to accumulate. Such resources are often characteristic of 'natural' ecosystems and are critical to successful ecosystem recovery. Deadwood or 'coarse woody debris' (CWD) is one such example. Coarse woody debris is depauperate in many of the world's ecosystems due to stand structural simplification through vegetation clearing, logging and grazing. The lag time in the natural accumulation of CWD can be a major barrier to their effective ecological restoration in the short term. We examined the effect of experimentally adding CWD, in four different treatments, on reptile abundance in temperate woodlands in south-eastern Australia - one of the most highly degraded vegetation types on the continent. We then investigated the influence that varying grazing pressure and vegetation density had on those effects. We examined three key questions: (1) Does the addition of CWD change overall reptile abundance over a 4. year period? (2) Does existing vegetation density or kangaroo grazing effect reptile response? (3) Is there evidence of high order interaction effects between CWD, kangaroo grazing and vegetation density on reptile response? Adding CWD increased reptile abundance significantly after only 4. years. The spatial pattern of CWD distribution also significantly affected reptile abundance. The location where CWD was added also was important, with open and mid-dense vegetation gaining the highest number of small skinks compared to control sites. Reduction of grazing was the most effective way of increasing small skink abundance in high density vegetation. Open areas gained most from the addition of CWD where high kangaroo grazing occurred. We conclude that adding CWD can short-cut a 100-200. year barrier to ecosystem restoration. By distributing CWD in particular patterns and places in the landscape, and in combination with different grazing levels, conservation managers can improve effectiveness of restoration programs. "
879,2893,"Abundance and exploitation of loggerhead turtles nesting in Boa Vista island, Cape Verde: the only substantial rookery in the eastern Atlantic","The main nesting area for loggerhead turtles in the eastern Atlantic is in the Cape Verde Islands, largely restricted to the island of Boa Vista. Extensive monitoring demonstrated a globally significant population for the species despite a sustained high level of anthropogenic take of nesting females for local consumption. Through an extensive stratified monitoring program across the island in the seasons 20072009, we estimated a total of 13?955, 12?028 and 19?950 clutches in the 3 years, respectively. These values indicate that the mean number of nesting females averaged 3700. Considering that a female breed, on average, every 2.4 years, we estimate that the overall number of adult females in the population during these three seasons was 8900. These levels are much higher than those suggested in previous studies which were more constrained in spatial coverage. Our findings indicate that Cape Verde hosts the third largest nesting aggregation for this species in the world after the south-eastern US and Oman, with some sites having a particularly high density of nests, facilitating targeted monitoring and conservation. Consumption of sea turtle meat is a traditional practice in Cape Verde that continues despite national sea turtle protection laws. We estimated that 36, 18 and 5% of nesting females were harvested in the 3 years of the study, respectively. Increasing beach protection and monitoring, ongoing educational programs and cooperative projects with local communities are urgently needed to further safeguard the only major loggerhead nesting aggregation in the eastern Atlantic."
880,1584,"Periodic fluctuations in small mammals at Boda, Sweden from 1961 to 1988","Clethrionomys glareolus was the dominant small mammal, comprising 85% of the total catch of 1955 small rodents. This species fluctuated cyclically with peaks averaging 3.6 yr apart over the 28 yr of the study and an average amplitude of 55-fold. Microtus agrestis and Apodemus flavicollis, although much less common, showed cyclic fluctuations in close synchrony with C. glareolus. Sorex araneus was much more common in the area in the 1960s than it is today, but it also has fluctuated in synchrony with the Clethrionomys cycle. Clethrionomys showed the Chitty Effect of increased body weights of adults in the peak density years. -from Authors"
881,2055,"Nesting activity and reproductive output of loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, over 19 Seasons (1984-2002) at Laganas Bay, Zakynthos, Greece: the largest rookery in the Mediterranean","Nesting data for the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) are presented over a 19-year period (1984-2002) from Laganas Bay, Zakynthos Island, Greece. The nesting habitat is comprised of six beaches, totaling 5.5 km, which differ in physical features and human pressures. An average of 1293.7 nests were laid per season over the available nesting habitat, giving an overall nesting density of 235.2 nests/km, by far the highest in the Mediterranean. Mean nesting density was unevenly distributed per beach, ranging from 53.7 nests/km to 1062.8 nests/km. Despite the 19-year standardized work, no linear trend in the annual number of nests was detected. An overall 79.3% of laid nests were hatched, with an average clutch size of 116.5 eggs and a hatchling emergence success of 66.6%, yielding a mean annual output of 81,128 viable hatchlings. Spatial variability in incubation durations indicated production of hatchlings with different sex ratios on different beaches, with one producing almost entirely male hatchlings. Conservation measures for this important habitat, hosting 25.7% of the documented total loggerhead nesting effort in the Mediterranean, are in conflict with local economic interests and poorly enforced. However, the recent creation of a National Marine Park and associated Management Agency, comprising government, local communities, and environmental organizations, provides hope for a more balanced situation in the future."
882,866,"Trends, dynamics and resilience of an Ethiopian wolf population.","Fifteen years of monitoring in the Bale Mountains provide a valuable time series to better understand the dynamics of populations of the endangered Ethiopian wolf Canis simensis in the face of epizootics and increasing human pressure. Linetransect counts in four study areas were used to identify trends in the local abundances of wolves, people, livestock and domestic dogs (a putative rabies reservoir). Estimates of wolf abundance were validated against total counts in prime wolf habitats, where two local populations decimated by rabies in the early 1990s had recovered fully by 2000. Growth appeared to be regulated by negative density dependence, but the rate of growth was unexpectedly low at reduced densities. Limitations to rapid growth, including an initial gap for which data were sparse, are discussed. In a poorer habitat, wolf abundance estimates were less reliable but indicated slight fluctuations without an overall trend. A local extinction was recorded in an area of marginal habitat. With this exception, trends in wolf abundances were unrelated to trends in the abundance of people, livestock or dogs. Rabies emerged as the main cause of decline for high-density populations. The rapidly increasing livestock grazing pressure in Bale gives cause for concern, calling for further research on its impacts upon long-term wolf survival. "
883,4347,,"The 9th National Census of tree breeding Herons colonies in France (7 species) occurred in spring 2007 (completed in 2008) thanks to a network of more than 787 observers belonging to 100 organisations, coordinated by Loïc MARION. The total number of nests reached 66 096 distributed in 1914 species-colonies (in 1387 sites). The Grey Heron was the more abundant (31 138 nests in 1236 colonies), but is levelling-off (+4,89% since 2000). The Purple Heron stopped its decline by increasing by 46% with 2828 nests in 192 colonies. However, the population of the Dombes had to be estimated (390 nests in 50 colonies) due to lack of census. The Black-crowned Night Heron, which also still largely winters in Africa, decreased to 3355 nests in 142 colonies, a drop of 20% in spite of increasing its number of colonies by 60%. Although also migrating, the Squacco Heron pursued its increase (108%) with 576 nests, albeit in only 18 colonies, 11 of which are in the Camargue, then largely limited its range in France. Thanks to the lack of long cold spells along the coasts since 1987, the Cattle Egret was still increasing (by 94%) with 14098 nests in 111 colonies, also in the large majority distributed in the Camargue and Languedoc-Roussillon, but it has pursued its expansion on the Atlantic coast up to Brittany and bred even in Normandy. The Little Egret, although benefiting from the same conditions, showed a limited increase (near 10%) with only 13 727 breeding pairs in 221 colonies, but still extended along the coasts up to Normandy. Finally, the Great White Egret, which appeared as a breeder at Lac de Grand-Lieu in 1994, is now well established, having formed new colonies in Loire-Atlantique and increasing its numbers in the Camargue and in the Somme where only isolated pairs bred before. This species now totals about 180 nests in 13 colonies in France."
884,4349,,"From 1968 to 1990, the population of Little Bittern in France experienced the sharpest decrease (-88%) observed in Europe, from circa 2000 pairs to 250, with a strong range contraction mainly affecting the western part of the country. However, by the end of the 1990s the total population had slowly recovered (242-300 in 1997), and continued to increase more rapidly afterward, to reach circa 670 pairs in 2003-04, with more reliable data compared to previous periods. Although some areas have been better surveyed in recent years, this does not, on its own, explain the absence of data from some parts, as the species decline was noted on the European scale. Local habitat modifications, and some behavioural changes such as an increased use of willows in reedbeds, may explain some local variations, but do not appear to be the main causes of general population trends. It must be noted that the very long and severe drought affecting wintering areas in Africa exactly corresponded the sharp decrease noted between 1968 and 1995 and that the species recovery in the late 1990s matches up the return to normal rainfall."
885,3095,Conservation problems and research needs for Bristle-thighed Curlews Numenius tahitiensis on their wintering grounds,"The Bristle-thighed Curlew Numenius tahitiensis is a rare shorebird that breeds in western; Alaska and winters on oceanic islands in the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean.; Before human colonization, the islands on which curlews winter were devoid of terrestrial; predators, allowing curlews to evolve a rapid moult during which about 50% of; adults become flightless. Especially when flightless, these birds are vulnerable to harvest; by humans and to predation by introduced mammals such as dogs and cats. On atolls; where they are harvested by humans, curlews tend to occur only on uninhabited islets.; Consequently, human encroachment in Oceania has probably reduced Bristle-thighed; Curlew numbers and altered winter distribution of the species. Future studies should; (1) identify concentrations of wintering curlews, focusing in the Tuamotu Archipelago;; (2) determine whether migratory stopover sites exist in the central Pacific between Hawaii; and the southern end of the wintering grounds; and (3) establish a monitoring programme; to assess population trends in several parts of the winter range. A comprehensive; plan is needed to provide for the existence of predator-free islands throughout key; portions of the winter range."
886,3169,Demography of Bristle-thighed Curlews Numenius tahitiensis wintering on Laysan Island,"We studied the nonbreeding ecology of Bristle-thighed Curlews Numenius tahitiensis from 1988 to 1991 on Laysan Island in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Using capture-recapture analysis, we estimated that 300- 350 curlews wintered on the island. Annual survival was >85% for adults and 92% for first-year birds. Young birds remained on the island until at least their third calendar year, when some individuals made 'exploratory' visits to other islands in the Northwestern chain. Most of the birds marked in their first year migrated north to the breeding grounds when they were 3 years old: several birds remained on the island until they were at least 4 years old. Adults returned to the same discrete home ranges year after year, whereas subadults which do not migrate) tended to rise a greater portion of the island. At least 60% of the subadults marked from 1988 to 1990 returned to the island to winter as adults. Because young curlews arrived after adults and experienced high survivorship while on the island, there did not appear to be intense competition for space at Laysan even though the island is at the northern end of the species' winter range."
887,2056,"Status of the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, Lepidochelys kempii","The primary nesting beach of the critically endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempii) at Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, was not recorded until 1947 and not known to science until 1961. Conservation work started there in 1966; during the second half of the 1960s nestings of over 2000 turtles per season were recorded, but in spite of several years of protection, between 1985 and 1987 nesting abundance reached the lowest point, with an annual average of 824 nests per year. After 1988 nesting started to increase and by 2003 had reached 5373 nests per year. With Rancho Nuevo nesting females estimated at 40,000 in 1947 and recorded at a low of 343 in 1985-87 with a gradual increase to 2339 in 2003, the nesting population had a decrease of about 99% over 40 years and has now begun to recover, but is still decreased by about 94% compared to historical levels. Until 1977 daily beach patrols covered only 27 km of beach, since then the protected area has increased slowly to over 230 km, including beaches in the state of Veracruz. Between 1966 and 1977 the average number of hatchlings released annually in Rancho Nuevo was around 23,000; since 1978 this number has increased gradually - in 2003 over 470,000 hatchlings were released. Head-start and imprinting efforts as well as ex-situ captive breeding have also been undertaken. The Rancho Nuevo beach was designated a ""Natural Reserve"" in 1977, covering 20 km of coastline and 4 km wide. The species has also been recorded to nest on some beaches in Veracruz in Mexico and on Padre Island in Texas, USA."

Fyke nets were used to determine the current distribution ranges of fish in the catchment to update a 1997 survey and to provide key information for the compilation of a conservation strategy for the Twee River redfin, Barbus erubescens. Population estimates from 1997 placed their total number at 8 400, but population size could not be estimated from the present surveys. A number of small populations of Twee River redfin and Twee River galaxias, which are restricted to two short stretches of tributary rivers, were identified. Their long-term survival remains uncertain. Conservation action, including the eradication of alien fish and the creation of a dedicated sanctuary for the endemic populations, is recommended. "
889,3038,"Condition, status and trends and projected futures of the dugong in the Northern Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait; including identification and evaluation of the key threats and evaluation of available management options to improve its status","This survey is the second of an integrated series of three aerial surveys which aim to survey the entire Queensland coast for dugongs over three field seasons. It provides the first synopsis of the distribution and abundance of the dugong on the remote coast of Queensland from Cooktown north including Torres Strait. The results of previous surveys of sections of this region have been difficult to interpret because of the potentially confounding influences of unpredictable dugong movements between areas within the region. The results of the 2006 survey of the whole region of almost 56,000 km2 suggest a total population of some 23500 + 2900 dugongs close to the estimate of some 23000 +2600 for the combined 2000 survey of the Northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and 2001 surveys of Torres Strait. Both estimates are based on the method of Pollock et al. (2006)."
890,3465,Distribution and abundance of dugongs in the northern Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,"In 1984 and 1985, dugongs were censused from the air at an overall sampling intensity of 9% over a total area of 31 288 km2 within the northern sections of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Sightings were corrected for perception bias (the proportion of animals visible in the transect which are missed by observers), and availability bias (the proportion of animals that are invisible due to water turbidity) with survey-specific correction factors. There were no significant differences between population and density estimates obtained from repeat surveys of the same areas. The resultant population estimate (±s.e.) was 8110± 1073 dugongs at an overall density (±s.e.) of 0-26±0-03 km-2, a precision of 13%. Dugongs occurred up to 58 km offshore and in water up to 37 m deep. The highest density of animals was seen on coastal seagrass beds at depths of <5 m. Maps of density and distribution are given. The design and timing of future surveys is also discussed. "
891,3518,Size and structure of a photographically identified population of manta rays Manta alfredi in southern Mozambique,"The size and structure of a photographically identified population of reef manta ray, Manta alfredi, were examined at aggregation sites over a four-year period in southern Mozambique. The use and standardisation of photo-ID techniques was examined as a minimally-intrusive means to study this species. Using these techniques, we report on the size, structure and seasonality of this population of M. alfredi. In total, 449 individuals were identified during this time period, 40.5% of which were re-sighted on at least one occasion. The longest period between re-sighting events was 1,252 days. During the study period, annual population size estimates for M. alfredi ranged from 149 to 454 individuals. The superpopulation size estimate for the entire study period was 802 individuals, the first reported for M. alfredi at a monitored aggregation site. A highly significant sex bias was evident with a female:male ratio of 3.55:1. The majority of rays (89.9% males; 49.7% females) were considered mature, with most individuals between 3.0 and 4.9 m in disc width. Manta alfredi were observed at the study sites in each month of the calendar year. The maximum number of individual rays seen per dive was 30. Large numbers of rays (20 + per dive) were seen in the months of November, December and January, which coincide with the breeding season. Natural markings were unique to individuals and did not change substantially with time, which provided further support for their use in the identification of individual M. alfredi over multiple years. Multiple re-sightings of individual M. alfredi suggest that many individuals in this population exhibit site fidelity to the examined aggregation sites. As target subsistence fishing for M. alfredi exists along the Mozambican coastline, management efforts to monitor and prevent overexploitation at these critical habitats should be a priority. "

The possibility that there may be a migration from south to north is considered. The catch per unit effort appears to be independent of the present level of fishing effort but may be determined by the annual rainfall two years earlier. In this respect, Lake Kivu is similar to Lake Kariba where nutrient supply is determined by river flow."

Molecular research assessed the existence of an; evolutionary significant unit in the edible dormouse populations living in south Italy, Sicily and Sardinia, and we decided to investigate; the environmental factors capable of explaining its occurrence and abundance in Sicily, for a better management of these populations.; We assessed the species habitat preferences by setting 25 large and 25 small nestboxes in five sample areas along an altitudinal gradient; of the Madonie Range, and recorded habitat variables, food availability, and demographic data for two years. To obtain synthetic; descriptors of the dormice habitat requirements, we extracted uncorrelated linear combinations of original variables by Principal; Component Analysis; then we modelled habitat preferences of dormice by Generalized Linear Models, and selected the best models by; Akaikes information criterion and model averaging. Dormice abundances varied markedly between the two years of study. Population; peaked and reproduced in 2010, a masting year of oaks and beeches. In the following non-masting year, a much lower number of adults; and yearlings used nestboxes, without any sign of reproduction. In both years we found a significant effect of altitudinal vegetation belt.; Dormice seem to prefer mixed broad-leaved and evergreen (cork, holm) oak forests below 800-1300 m a.s.l, to beech forests at higher; altitude, and avoid coniferous plantations. Inside these woodlands they seem to prefer monotypic and mature oak-stands with dense; canopies. Large nestboxes are more preferred than small ones only during reproductive years. Protection of large and mature woodland; from wildfires and forestry management caring the retention of significant elements like old trees, logs and litter mounds are necessary; to maintain the habitat of edible dormouse in Southern Mediterranean forests.

Emerging and invasive pathogens can have long-lasting impacts on susceptible wildlife ; populations, including localised collapse and extirpation. Management of threatening disease is of ; widespread interest and requires knowledge of spatiotemporal patterns of pathogen spread.  ; 2. Theory suggests disease spread often occurs via two patterns: homogenous mixing and travelling ; waves. However, high resolution empirical data demonstrating localised (within population) disease ; spread patterns are rare.   ; 3. This study examined the spread of sarcoptic mange (aetiological agent Sarcoptes scabiei) in a ; population of bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus), and investigated whether pathogen spread ; occurred by homogenous mixing or a travelling wave.  ; 4. Using seven years of population surveys and four years of disease severity surveys, we show that ; mange was first detected in the east of a wombat population in northern Tasmania, and progressed ; westward as a travelling wave. Wombat mortality rates reached 100% behind the wave, with a 94% ; decline in overall wombat abundance within the park.  ; 5. Synthesis and applications. Globally distributed pathogens may have severe impacts on ; susceptible host species. This is the first study to quantify population level impacts of sarcoptic ; mange upon bare-nosed wombats, showing a wave of mange disease which resulted in a dramatic ; population decline. Successful management of the spread of this and similar pathogens may hinge ; on the capacity to establish transmission barriers at local or between-population scales."
895,3155,Abundance and distribution of waterbirds on the Knysna Estuary,"Twelve waterbird counts were undertaken on the Knysna Estuary during January (summer) and July (winter); from 1993 to 1998. A total of 67 species were recorded; a median of 5343 waterbirds were present during summer,; 76% of them Palearctic migrants, dropping to a median of 2336 waterbirds in winter. Waterbird numbers; were about a third lower than normal during January 1997 following a flood in November 1996. There was a; shift from a summer avifauna comprised predominantly of invertebrate-feeding migrant waders to a winter; avifauna comprised mainly of piscivorous species. During the summer, 52% of the birds were Curlew Sandpipers; and Grey Plovers, Greenshanks, Kelp Gulls and Whimbrels each made up more than 6% of the avifauna.; During the winter Kelp Gulls, Cape and Reed Cormorants, Little Egrets and Sacred Ibises together comprised; 62% of the avifauna. The majority of invertebrate-feeding birds were found on the intertidal mudbanks around; the Ashmead Channel and on the Brenton side of the estuary below the rail bridge, whereas the shallow water; areas between the rail and N2 bridges were important to piscivorous birds, especially during the winter. The; Knysna Estuary, being the largest estuarine system in the warm temperate region of South Africa, supports the; largest number of birds of any estuarine system between Cape Agulhas and Durban Bay. However, bird densities; are not as high as on other important bird estuaries and it is hypothesised that this may be due to recreational; disturbance and to the relatively low density and availability of macrobenthic invertebrates."
896,2671,"Number, seasonal movements, and residency characteristics of river dolphins in an Amazonian floodplain lake system","The size and structure of a community of Amazon river dolphins or botos, Inia geoffrensis (de Blainville, 1817), was investigated using boat surveys and long-term observations of recognisable animals. Year-round, some 260 botos occurred in or near the 225-km2 Mamiraua varzea floodplain lake system, of which half were permanent residents by our definition. Seasonal variation in water levels influenced distribution between habitats but not the overall number of botos. Ninety percent of marked botos encountered within the lake system were permanent residents. There appeared to be a cline in site fidelity between those that always live in or near the system and those that visit at intervals of years. We estimated that 270 botos were ""significant users"" of the lake system (i.e., occurred within it for sufficient periods in a year to be observed at least once) and that many others visited for short periods. Individuals moved many tens to hundreds of kilometres along the rivers, but there was no broad-scale seasonal migration. The boto population of the central Amazon, at least, may be structured on the basis of floodplain lake systems, with extensive animal movement between systems. We estimate that 13 000 botos occur in the 11240 km2 Mamirauna Sustainable Development Reserve, which covers an estimated 11%-18% of varzea habitat in Brazil."
897,2666,River dolphins and flooded forest: seasonal habitat use and sexual segregation of botos (Inia geoffrensis) in an extreme cetacean environment,"Habitat use by the boto, or Amazon river dolphin Inia geoffrensis, was investigated in and around the Mamirauá Reserve, Brazil. Largely forested with numerous channels and lakes, Mamirauá comprises a variety of seasonal floodplain habitats known collectively as várzea. The annual cycle of flooding in this region (amplitude 11-15 m) dominates all life. Profound seasonal differences in dolphin density between habitats were consistent with known fish movements, in turn dictated by changes in water level and dissolved oxygen. An exodus of botos from floodplain to river at low water prevents dolphins being trapped in areas that become entirely dry. Densities of botos in floodplain channels were seasonally higher (up to 18 km-2) than reported for any cetacean worldwide. Adults were largely segregated by sex except at low water. Females and calves dominated in chavascal habitat - the areas most remote from rivers, which were preferred by males. Probable causes of this segregation are the energetic requirements of calves and the safety of females and/or calves from male harassment. Some 80% of botos occurring on rivers were within 150 m of the margins. The reliance of adult females and calves on várzea in a region with exceptional dolphin densities demonstrates the importance of floodplain habitats for the boto, and may be the key determinant of this species' distribution."
898,1677,"RECRUITMENT, DISPERSAL, AND DEMOGRAPHIC RESCUE IN SPATIALLY-STRUCTURED WHITE-TAILED PTARMIGAN POPULATIONS’","We studied recruitment and dispersal of White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus) breeding in naturally fragmented alpine habitats at four study sites in Colorado from 1987-1998. Almost all recruitment for both sexes, particularly females, was of birds produced outside local populations and also external to nearby studied populations. Populations were more dependent on female recruitment than on male recruitment to sustain them, and patterns of recruitment were not correlated with local survival of adults or production of young the previous year, except at one site for females. Over 95% of recruits were yearlings. Breeding dispersal of adults, an infrequent but regular event, was also important to inter-population connectivity. Our data for multiple populations allowed us to describe movement patterns among populations to assess consistency with conditions required for a rescue system. After widespread reproductive failure in one year, we expected all populations the next year would have low recruitment due to a reduced supply of recruits produced in the region. Recruitment was low, but impact varied among populations. We conducted an over-winter study of radio-marked offspring to determine possible influences of winter site location and relatives on recruitment patterns. Contrary to expectation, offspring remained on or near breeding sites in winter, but were not located near their mothers or siblings. Recruitment location was related to winter site location. White-tailed Ptarmigan exhibit a well developed capacity for external recruitment that allows them to persist in small populations with stochastic conditions for breeding and survival. Extensive external recruitment may be a general pattern for birds."
899,1663,"Breeding performance, age effects and territory occupancy in a Bonelli’s Eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus population","Bonelli's Eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus is one of the most endangered birds of prey in Europe. Despite mounting interest and research, several questions regarding the conservation implications of territory occupancy and site-dependent population regulation remain insufficiently explored for this species. Here, we report on a 12-year study of the territorial structure of a Bonelli's Eagle population in southeastern Spain. No signals of population decline were found in the breeding population, as mean annual productivity was stable and the presence of mixed-age pairs in the population decreased with the years. However, the average proportion of subadults occupying territories was larger than that observed in other Spanish populations. Contrary to the predictions of a despotic distribution model, we found no significant relationship between occupancy rates and breeding parameters. Our results showed significant variations in productivity attributable to differences in the quality of individuals (i.e. mixed versus adult pairs), but no variability among territories per se (i.e. caused by habitat heterogeneity). Moreover, coexistence with intraguild species did not have any significant effect on productivity, although the proximity of Eagle Owls Bubo bubo affected the occupation rate of territories. Finally, our population does not appear to experience site-dependent population regulation, as a positive relation between mean annual productivity and density was found. The threat posed by changes in land use in the study area leads us to suggest that strict protection of current territories is necessary to ensure population persistence, and we suggest that a significant population increase is only likely if new or deserted territories become available.

900,4384,Assessing the effectiveness of a hunting moratorium on target and non-target species,"Information on the effectiveness of wildlife management actions is scarce, despite the great relevance of this type of information for maximizing conservation goals while minimizing resource expenditure. Here we assess the management effectiveness of a four-year hunting moratorium, addressed to protecting a declining waterbird game species: common coot Fulica atra. We also studied the indirect benefits that this management action could have had on a non-target endangered species (crested coot Fulica cristata), currently being reintroduced in the study region (Comunidad Valenciana, eastern Spain). We found that wintering common coots interrupted their marked negative trend coinciding with the hunting moratorium, and Before-After-Control-Impact modelling confirmed this fact. However breeding common coots continued their negative trend in numbers. We also found that crested coots increased their wintering numbers during the hunting moratorium years but not during breeding. We detected a strong and time variant cost of release on survival probability of crested coots, but annual survival probability was found to be constant and low for experienced birds, with no clear effects of the hunting moratorium on survival probability. We conclude that the moratorium had some positive effect on both species, but we suggest that lack of enforcement during a traditional hunting practice at the end of each hunting season, most likely precluded the moratorium having a long-lasting effect on the breeding numbers and probably on survival, of both species. Hence, when fully-enforced hunting moratoria are difficult to implement, we recommend the creation of hunting preserves of high habitat quality to attract coots during the winter, allowing its subsequent reproduction during the breeding season.

901,1286,"Seahorse declines in the Derwent estuary, Tasmania in the absence of fishing pressure","Seahorses have the potential to be flagship species for estuarine conservation around the world and considerable concern has arisen over their declining abundance in the face of exploitation. All seahorses were recently listed on CITES Appendix II in recognition of threats posed by unsustainable trade. However, the efficacy of this measure and the development of other effective conservation solutions will require an understanding of natural seahorse population dynamics at relevant ecological scales. In this study, we provide quantitative data on seahorse populations over nested spatial and temporal scales up to 10 km and 3.5 years. Unexploited populations of the big-bellied seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis) in the Derwent estuary, Tasmania, Australia consisted largely of mature adults with highly female-biased sex ratios at all sites. While big-bellied seahorses had an aggregated distribution at the spatial scale of our transects (200 m2), most individuals were found alone. When they occurred in groups, the distribution of individuals was random with respect to sex in contrast to the pair bonds found in other seahorse species. All three monitored populations showed significant declines in abundance of 79-98% over the period 2001-2004. Estuarine physicochemical conditions did not change markedly during this period. Possible causes of seahorse declines are interactions with invasive species, disease or reproductive limitation through Allee effects. The magnitude of the declines in the absence of direct exploitation demonstrates that seahorses face multiple threats. Robust fisheries-independent monitoring will be required to demonstrate that conservation actions such as CITES listing are effective. "
902,2392,Habitat preferences and interannual variability in occurrence of the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena off northwest Scotland,"The harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena is the most common cetacean around the British Isles, but knowledge of its ecology, habitat preferences and inter-annual variability is still inadequate. Here, sightings collected by the Sea Watch Foundation during vessel surveys in Westcotland (August during the years 1993, 1994, 1996 and 1997) were critically analysed and used to construct a predictive habitat model for harbour porpoises in the Greater Minch. Generalised additive models were used to analyse relative abundance in relation to environmental variables; a preference for waters within 15 km from the shore and between 50 and 150 m depth was clearly identified. A relationship between tidal variables and porpoise distribution was also recognised with more sightings predicted for high tidal stream speed areas as well as during times of high tide. Maps constructed from the model were used to identify potential 'hotspots'and compare between years. Four areas with high relative abundance were identified in (1) the region between Ardnamurchan, Colland the Small Isles, (2) southeast of Barra, (3) northeast of Skye to Gairloch, and (4) west of Pairc Peninsula (Isle of Lewis) to Shiant Islands. Number of sightings fluctuated up to 4-fold between consecutive years; such extreme variability in relative abundance is offered as a bench-mark for comparing trends in the future as well as evidence that the Greater Minch represents only a small part of the effective range of this population. "
903,2495,Wolf survival and population trend using non-invasive capture–recapture techniques in the Western Alps,"Reliable estimates of population parameters are often necessary for conservation management but these are hard to obtain for elusive, rare and wide-ranging species such as wolves Canis lupus. This species has naturally recolonized parts of its former habitat in Western Europe; however, an accurate and cost-effective method to assess population trend and survival has not been implemented yet. We used open-model capture-recapture (CR) sampling with non-invasive individual identifications derived from faecal genotyping to estimate survival and trend in abundance for wolves in the Western Alps between 1999 and 2006. Our sampling strategy reduced individual heterogeneity in recaptures, thus minimizing bias and increasing the precision of the estimates. Young wolves had lower apparent annual survival rates (0·24 ± 0·06) than adult wolves (0·82 ± 0·04); survival rates were lower in the summer than in the winter for both young and adults. The wolf population in the study area increased from 21 ± 9·6 wolves in 1999 to 47 ± 11·2 wolves in late winter 2005; the population growth rate (λ = 1·04 ± 0·27) was lower than that recorded for other recolonizing wolf populations. We found a positive trend in wolf abundance, regardless of the method used. However, the abundance estimate based on snow-tracking was on average 36·2% (SD = 13·6%) lower than that from CR modelling, because young dispersing wolves are likely to have lower sign detection rates in snow-track surveys, a problem adequately addressed by CR sampling. Synthesis and applications. We successfully implemented a new method to assess large carnivore population trend and survival at large spatial scales. These are the first such estimates for wolves in Italy and in the Alps and have important management implications. Our approach can be widely applied to broader spatial and temporal scales for other elusive and wide-ranging species in Europe and elsewhere. "
904,4464,Increasing variation in population size and species composition ratio in mixed-species heron colonies in Japan,"Long-term population dynamics of colonial herons and egrets are well documented in Europe and the USA, but not in East and South-East Asia. Here the population dynamics of mixed-species colonies from 2002 to 2011 in Ibaraki prefecture, east Kanto, Japan, are reported. From censuses based on a combination of aerial and ground surveys, the number of breeding colonies was found to vary from 15 to 20. The population dynamics of Great Egret Casmerodius albus and Black-crowned Night Heron Nycticorax nycticorax remained relatively constant, while Grey Heron Ardea cinerea and Intermediate Egret Mesophoyx intermedia increased, but Little Egret Egretta garzetta and Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis decreased. When data for the six species were combined, the sum of their populations was almost constant, but variation increased in colony size, species composition ratio and the number of years that individual colonies existed. The population of colonies typically ranged from 200 to 2,000 individuals up to 2004, but smaller (under 200 individuals) and larger (over 2,000 individuals) colonies appeared after 2006. Increased variation in the number of consecutive years colonies existed was closely related to increased variation in colony size. Increased variation in species composition ratios in colonies was not a by-product of the increased variation in colony size, and the occurrence of colonies dominated by Grey Heron, Intermediate Egret or Black-crowned Night Heron after 2006 played an important role in the structural changes of mixed-species colonies."
905,4379,Apparent constant adult survival of a Sand martin Riparia riparia population in relation to climatic variables,"The Sand Martin Riparia riparia is a trans-Saharan migrant species, whose populations are declining throughout Europe. We present the results of a multiple year study on a breeding population of Sand Martins along the River Po in Northern Italy through ringing breeding birds at nesting colonies (2002-2014). There was a trend for the abundance of the studied population to fluctuate. Recapture data were analysed to obtain apparent survival probabilities which differed between the sexes, but not between years. No apparent relationship was found between survival and three different meteo-climatic indices (North Atlantic Oscillation, Sahel rainfall and Lake Chad rainfall). During the 1980s and 1990s, winter survival was positively correlated with rainfall in the winter quarters. Although rainfall in the winter quarters has been more stable during the past 15 years, Sand Martin populations are still decreasing. Our findings suggest that the relationship with rainfall no longer holds, and that current population declines may be unrelated to climate in the winter quarters."
906,4572,Demographic and genetic collapses in spatially structured populations: insights from a long-term survey in wild fish metapopulations,"Unraveling the relationship between demographic declines and genetic changes over time is of critical importance to predict the persistence of at-risk populations and to propose efficient conservation plans. This is particularly relevant in spatially structured populations (i.e. metapopulations) in which the spatial arrangement of local populations can modulate both demographic and genetic changes. We used ten-year demo-genetic monitoring to test 1) whether demographic declines were associated with genetic diversity declines and 2) whether the spatial structure of a metapopulation can weaken or reinforce these demographic and genetic temporal trends. We continuously surveyed, over time and across their entire range, two metapopulations of an endemic freshwater fish species Leuciscus burdigalensis: one metapopulation that had experienced a recent demographic decline and a second metapopulation that was stable over time. In the declining metapopulation, the number of alleles rapidly decreased, the inbreeding coefficient increased, and a genetic bottleneck emerged over time. In contrast, genetic indices were constant over time in the stable metapopulation. We further show that, in the declining metapopulation, demographic and genetic declines were not homogeneously distributed across the metapopulation. We notably identify one local population situated downstream as a reservoir of individuals and genetic variability that dampens both the demographic and genetic declines measured at the metapopulation level. We demonstrate the usefulness of long-term monitoring that combines both genetic and demographic parameters to understand and predict temporal population fluctuations of at-risk species living in a metapopulation context."
907,2261,"Ongoing population-level impacts on killer whales Orcinus orca following the ‘Exxon Valdez’ oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska","Killer whales were photographed in oil after the 1989 'Exxon Valdez' oil spill, but preliminary damage assessments did not definitively link mortalities to the spill and could not evaluate recovery. In this study, photo-identification methods were used to monitor 2 killer whale populations 5 yr prior to and for 16 yr after the spill. One resident pod, the AB Pod, and one transient population, the AT1 Group, suffered losses of 33 and 41 %, respectively, in the year following the spill. Sixteen years after 1989, AB Pod had not recovered to pre-spill numbers. Moreover, its rate of increase was significantly less than that of other resident pods that did not decline at the time of the spill. The AT1 Group, which lost 9 members following the spill, continued to decline and is now listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Although there may be other contributing factors, the loss of AT1 individuals, including reproductive-age females, accelerated the population's trajectory toward extinction. The synchronous losses of unprecedented numbers of killer whales from 2 ecologically and genetically separate groups and the absence of other obvious perturbations strengthens the link between the mortalities and lack of recovery, and the 'Exxon Valdez' oil spill.

908,3595,The Clodia database: a long term series of fishery data from the Adriatic Sea,"Long-term time series of species abundances can depict population declines and changes in communities in response to anthropogenic activities, climate changes, alterations of trophic relationships. Here we present a database of historical marine fishery landing data, covering a remarkably long time series (1945-2013) and referring to one of the most exploited areas of the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea. The database includes two time series of landing data, 1945-2013 and 1997-2013, from the official statistics of the fish market of Chioggia, where the major fishing fleet of the area operates. Comparisons between the landing data of the database and landing data from other fisheries or data from scientific surveys support the reliability of the time series in depicting changes in species abundances. The database is expected to be used by fishery biologists and ecologists interested in depicting and understanding temporal variations in species abundances and community composition, in relation to environmental and anthropogenic factors."
909,1932,American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) in Florida: recommendations for endangered species recovery and ecosystem restoration,"When the American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) was declared endangered in 1975, scant data were available for making management decisions. Results of intensive studies conducted during the late 1970s and early 1980s by the National Park Service, Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, and Florida Power and Light Company resulted in an optimistic outlook for crocodiles. However, new issues face crocodiles today. Florida and Biscayne bays have undergone changes that have caused concern for the health of these ecosystems. The purpose of this paper is to review results of monitoring programs for C. acutus that have been used as a basis for consideration of reclassification of this endangered species and for restoration of its endangered ecosystem. More crocodiles and nests occur in more places today than in 1975. The maximum number of nesting females in Florida has increased from 20 in 1975 to 85 in 2004, and the number of concentrations of nesting effort from two to four. This evidence supports the proposed reclassification of the American Crocodile from endangered to threatened. However, crocodiles are still threatened by modification of habitat because of development adjacent to crocodile habitat and will benefit from restored freshwater flow into estuaries. As crocodiles continue to increase in number and expand into new areas, interactions with humans will occur more frequently. The challenge of integrating a recovering population of the American Crocodile with an ever-increasing use of coastal areas by humans will be the final challenge in successful recovery of this once critically endangered species."
910,2847,Counting pumas by categorizing physical evidence,"The occurrence of Puma concolor (Cougar) can be confirmed by detecting physical evidence (i.e., tracks, urine markers). However, determining the number of pumas responsible for creating this sign is problematic. We addressed this difficulty by categorizing physical evidence (sign) and applied this method during the Puma concolor coryi (Florida Panther) project. Three rules were used to distinguish individuals. (1) Gender was determined by track size or stride length; (2) time (freshness) was determined by known events within the past 24 hours, such as wind or rain; and (3) distance between individual track sets was used as an exclusionary tool to avoid over-counting. We evaluated accuracy by capture and by comparison to 3 other indices. This method can be adapted to count other large felines."
911,4248,The demography of Atelopus decline: Harlequin frog survival and abundance in central Panama prior to and during a disease outbreak,"Harlequin frogs (Bufonidae: Atelopus) are a species-rich genus of Neotropical toads that have experienced disproportionately severe population declines and extinctions caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). The genus Atelopus is of high conservation concern, but relatively little is known about the population dynamics and life history of the majority of species. We examined the demography of one population of Atelopus zeteki and two populations of A. varius in central Panama using three to six years of mark-recapture data collected prior to and during an outbreak of Bd. We estimated male survival probabilities prior to the arrival of Bd and sex-specific population sizes for these three populations using state-space Bayesian population models. Prior to the arrival of Bd, monthly apparent survival probabilities were higher for A. varius males than for A. zeteki males, and recaptures among years were low in both species. Abundance of both species varied over time and declined rapidly after the arrival of Bd. Male densities were generally greater than female densities, though female densities were higher or equivalent to males after the arrival of Bd. Estimates of survival and abundance over time may be explained by differences in the use of stream habitat by the two sexes and three populations, both during and between breeding seasons. These estimates provide key baseline population information that can be used to inform reintroductions from captive assurance colonies and studies of extant Atelopus populations as part of conservation and management programs."
912,956,Diagnosing the cause of population changes: localized habitat change and the decline of the endangered St Helena wirebird,"1. Statistical models of population density and/or change in relation to habitat could aid the management of endangered species and help diagnose causes of population decline. Such models seek 'global' explanations for any decline, but endangered species are often vulnerable to highly localized habitat change that can have a significant impact on overall population. In such cases, statistical models can aid in interpreting the impact of localized habitat change on population density and so have a role in diagnosis. We illustrate this approach using data from the endangered St Helena wirebird, a small sand plover endemic to the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. 2. The wirebird inhabits pasture habitats and semi-desert areas. Census data suggest that wirebird abundance declined during the early 1990s, from 425 adult birds in 1989 to 335 adult birds by 1998-99. Abundance declined by 34-4% in pasture habitats, whereas abundance in semi-desert increased by 18% over this period. 3. We tested the hypothesis that the decline in abundance in pasture habitats was driven by vegetation change. Multiple regression modelling revealed that wirebird density in pasture was positively correlated with the cover of broad-leaved herbs, but negatively correlated with vegetation height and gorse cover prior to the decline in 1989. A performance test of this model showed that predictions were reliable. 4. The cover of broad-leaved herbs declined significantly between 1989 and 1998-99. However, there was no correlation between the change in wirebird density and the change in broad-leaved herb cover, indicating that this vegetation change was unlikely to have caused the decline in wirebird abundance. 5. The decline in the abundance of wirebirds in pasture habitats was primarily due to changes in three sites. Each experienced site-specific habitat changes, which were likely to cause a decrease in wirebird abundance on the basis of the multiple regression modelling of wirebird density in relation to habitat. We concluded that highly localized vegetation change, rather than general herb cover, played an important role in the overall population decline. 6. Our analysis provides clear habitat management recommendations: pasture management for livestock needs to be compatible with the production of herb-rich grassland, consisting of short vegetation and few woody plants, in order to benefit wirebird conservation. 7. Management decisions for endangered species are often required urgently, and as a result are invariably based on incomplete information, particularly concerning the demographic mechanisms involved in decline. Our approach illustrates a role for simple statistical models under these circumstances. Such models help diagnose the cause of a decline and promote initial, remedial, management actions. This work also shows how habitat effects on endangered species can be highly localized."
913,3294,"Relative abundance, age structure, and body size in mudpuppy populations in southwestern Ontario","Little is known of mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus) population structure and ecology; some populations in the Great Lakes are thought to be in decline. Mudpuppies are the obligate hosts for the mudpuppy mussel (Simpsonaias ambigua), a species that is endangered in Canada and in many Great Lakes states. We surveyed mudpuppies from the Sydenham River, the only known Canadian locality of the mudpuppy mussel, in order to generate information on relative density, deformity rates and population age/size structure and used this information to compare them to known mudpuppy populations from Great Lakes sites in the Detroit River, Lake St. Clair and Long Point in Lake Erie. Deformity rates were elevated at some sites in the Sydenham River. The relative density of mudpuppies in the Sydenham River was lower than that of other Great Lakes sites and their age was skewed towards younger individuals. Although at lower densities than at other Great Lakes sites, the mudpuppy population in the Sydenham River appears stable and is showing signs of recruitment which bodes well for the future of the mudpuppy mussel population of the river.

914,2982,Changes in the Coral Reef Community of Southwest Puerto Rico 1995 to 2005,"Six coral reefs in southwest Puerto Rico were censused in 1995 to examine species assemblages and their spatial distributions. This census was repeated in 2005 to detect temporal changes in distributions and abundance of species and associated substrata. Ten years after the original study, analyses indicated that 13 species of fishes declined significantly in numbers (a decrease of 21-100%), one species increased by 49% and nine species did not change in abundance. Among invertebrate species, one sponge, two corals and the urchin Diadema all increased in numbers (91-2167%), whereas one coral, a zoanthid, two urchins and three algae all declined significantly (24-70%). Four gorgonian genera did not change in numbers of colonies but grew significantly in size over 10 years. No change in abundance occurred among 14 species of invertebrates and plants. Overall species richness decreased significantly. Substrata sizes, an important habitat characteristic, remained the same on backreefs but changed significantly on forereefs: the amount of boulder decreased by 21% while the smaller substrata (cobble, pebble and sand) increased (85, 382 and 28% respectively). Sea surface temperature was warmer in 2005 than in 1995. "
915,2113,Likely Population-Level Effects of Contaminants on a Resident Estuarine Fish Species: Comparing Gillichthys mirabilis Population Static Measurements and Vital Rates in San Francisco and Tomales Bays,"Gillichthys mirabilis population static measurements (abundance, age, and size class structures) and vital rates (growth, mortality, recruitment) were monitored on an annual basis from 2002 to 2007. Population-level metrics were used to gauge habitat quality at two study sites (a contaminated site and a reference site) in two large northern California estuaries (San Francisco and Tomales Bays). San Francisco Bay populations exhibited slower growth and higher mortality rates and contained higher amounts of contaminants than Tomales Bay. Recruitment rates were highest at contaminated sites (Stege Marsh and Walker Creek) in 3 years out of 5 years, suggesting low adult survival. This study suggests that population-level effects on a residential fish may be attributed to estuarine contamination on the US Pacific coast. "
916,1674,Down but not out: marine turtles of the British Virgin Islands,"We present the result of a multi-annual assessment of the spatio-temporal patterns of marine turtle nesting, and foraging in the Eastern Caribbean archipelago state of the British Virgin Islands. Despite exploitation over several centuries, three species (leatherback Dermochelys coriacea, green Chelonia mydas and hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata turtles) are still nesting and green and hawksbill turtles are found foraging. Leatherback turtles are showing signs of a recovery co-incident with the implementation of an effective moratorium on adult take. When compared with historical data we demonstrate an apparent reduction in nesting levels in green and hawksbill turtles and a nesting range contraction in green turtles. Despite current conservation steps, it will be a decade or more before evidence of recovery can be expected in the two hard-shelled species. Coupled with wider biological knowledge, our findings offer insights into the relative resilience of the different species to exploitation pressure. Additionally, the intra-annual temporal and spatial spread of nesting demonstrated underlines the difficulties of monitoring such a multi-species assemblage in such a diffuse archipelago. "
917,2627,Demographic and morphological responses to prey depletion in a crested tern (Sterna bergii) population: can fish mortality events highlight performance indicators for fisheries management?,"Disease-related mortality events in 1995 and 1998, which killed [approximately]70% of adult sardine (Sardinops sagax) biomass, provided an opportunity to assess whether crested tern (Sterna bergii) populations were affected by decreased prey abundance. We investigated the diet, age structure, and morphology of a population of crested terns to determine whether survival and growth were reduced for cohorts reared in years immediately following sardine mortality events. The diet of chicks and adults differed significantly. Australian anchovy (Engraulis australis) and sardine were the dominant prey in the diets of chicks, constituting an average of 36.3 and 14.6% of individual prey items, respectively. Degens leatherjacket (Thamnoconus degeni) dominated the prey of adult terns, an average of 51.9% of individual prey items. Age-specific information collected from banded adults indicated that the cohort reared after the first sardine mortality event in 1995 exhibited significantly lower rates of recruitment to the breeding colony than as predicted by life-table analyses, suggesting that survival was reduced in response to the absence of sardine. Females from cohorts reared <1 year after the end of each sardine mortality event (in 1996 and 1999) were smaller than other age classes, suggesting that chick growth was reduced during periods of low sardine abundance. Future data on diet and on the survival and growth of crested tern chicks could provide performance indicators for management of sardine populations and aid in the development of conservation strategies for the populations of crested tern."
918,2062,"Regional desert tortoise monitoring in the Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit, Washington County, Utah","Precise and accurate estimates of desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) density are recognized as a critical component of both the Desert Tortoise (Mojave Population) Recovery Plan and the Washington County Habitat Conservation Plan. Distance sampling was utilized within the Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit, managed as the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve, to assess current population densities of desert tortoises. Intensive full-scale monitoring was completed within Management Zones 2, 3, and 5 of the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve from 1998 to 2001. The baseline density estimate of adult tortoises was 0.32 tortoises per hectare (95% CI: 0.29-0.36; CV: 5.85%) within Management Zone 3 and 0.29 tortoises per hectare (95% CI: 0.26-0.33; CV: 5.87%) throughout the Reserve."
919,1503,"Population status, trends and a re-examination of the hypotheses explaining the recent declines of the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina","1. Between the 1950s and 1990s the southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina underwent large decreases in population size throughout most of its breeding range in the Southern Ocean. While current population estimates suggest a recent recovery, some breeding populations have continued to decrease in recent years (Macquarie and Marion Islands), others have either remained stable (South Georgia, Kerguelen and Heard Island) or have increased (Peninsula Valdés, Argentina). 2. Intrinsi c hypotheses for patterns of regional decline include factors that are affected by density-dependent mechanisms: (i) paucity of males, (ii) population 'overshoot' and (iii) pandemic disease. Extrinsic hypotheses include (iv) predation, (v) competition with fisheries concerns, (vi) interspecific competition, (vii) environmental change and (viii) human disturbance. Of the eight hypotheses proposed and examined here, we conclude that three can be discounted (i, v, viii), three are unlikely, but may require more testing (ii, iii, iv) and two are plausible (vi, vii). 3. The interspecific competition hypot hesis is difficult to test because it requires the simultaneous monitoring of species that overlap directly with elephant seals, many of which have not been identified or little is known. However, an analysis of the relationship between log variance and log abundance (Taylor's power law) for populations of southern and northern elephant seals suggests that interspecific competition is not a significant factor in the decline of the southern elephant seal. 4. The hypothesis that decreases in southern elephant se al populations between the 1950s and 1990s were caused by the environmental change is the easiest to test and most plausible of the hypotheses. We propose a framework by which to test this hypothesis to determine how food availability affects individual survival. "
920,2861,"Conservation Implications of the Current Breeding Distribution and Abundance of the White-crowned Pigeon Patagioenas leucocephala at St. Croix, US Virgin Islands","Road and non-roadside surveys of breeding White-crowned Pigeons Patagioenas leucocephala were conducted on St. Croix from April through September 2002 and 2003. Confirmed or probable breeding birds were discovered at 15 sites, including all four cays off St. Croix, and two sites in the interior (21-25 m asl) where this species had not bred previously. An estimated 160-175 pairs nested each year, although numbers were low (1-10 pairs per site) except at two sites. Larger numbers occurred at Ruth Island and Great Pond (55-95 pairs each), and birds have increased at the latter site. Crude breeding densities at all sites ranged from 0.2 to 23.5 pairs/ha, with the highest densities both years (> 1 pair/ha) restricted to the three largest tidally influenced wetlands, the three smallest cays, and the Buccaneer Hotel. White-crowned Pigeons nested in two habitats: (a) low in manglars (islets of one or more red mangroves Rhizophora mangle without solid land) over standing water in mangrove wetlands, and (b) higher over ground in a variety of nest-sites in littoral woodland, especially on cays. Roadside point-transect surveys throughout St. Croix during May of 2004 and 2005 confirmed that most White-crowned Pigeons occur in the general vicinity of confirmed breeding sites, despite their ability to fly long distances. Protection of vulnerable breeding sites such as Ruth Island where squabs are still poached, restoration of manglars as sheltered nest-sites in several tidally influenced wetlands, and expansion of foraging areas in littoral woodland near breeding sites should be conservation priorities for the White-crowned Pigeon on St. Croix. Their current breeding status suggests this species should be downlisted from territorially endangered to threatened in the United States Virgin Islands. "
921,1735,Food regulates the Serengeti wildebeest: a 40-year record,"1. The migratory wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus (Burchell)) population of Serengeti has been monitored for 40 years (1958-1998). The population increased from 1963 to 1977, stabilized from 1977 to 1993 and declined during drought in 1993-94. These changes provided a significant contrast in densities and the opportunity to determine the life history stages where survival was density dependent and their causes. 2. There was a delay in age of maturity and a decline of both yearling and adult pregnancy rates at higher densities. Changes in yearling pregnancy had minimal effect on number of calves born. Adult pregnancy rate dropped from 95% to 88% 3. The greatest absolute mortality occurred in newborn calves (0-4 months old). The most variable survival was in dry-season calf mortality (5-11 months old). 4. Density dependence was clearly present in adult mortality and this appeared to be the regulating life stage. Density dependence was also found in dry-season calf mortality. The drop in pregnancy rate was only weakly density dependent. 5. The main cause of mortality (75% of cases) was undernutrition. Bone marrow condition showed that more animals died in extremely poor condition as the population increased and predators did not cause these deaths. 6. Predation played only a minor role in limiting the wildebeest population. Predators caught animals in moderate condition during the increase phase and increasingly healthy condition during years of high population density. The main predators were lion [Panthera leo (Linnaeus)] and hyaena (Crocuta crocuta Erxleben). 7. Adult mortality was significantly negatively related to food per capita. This could be viewed either as curvilinear density dependence, or as two phases of mortality. The first phase was during population increase when mortality was inversely density dependent and may have been caused by a constant predation rate. The second was during stability and decline and comprised the additive effects of undernutrition and predation. 8. Rainfall in the dry season was the most important extrinsic determinant of food supply for the wildebeest population but food was related to mortality only when population density was incorporated. 9. At present the wildebeest population appears regulated by natural causes through food supply. Human-caused mortality appears to be a minor factor. However, if the number of wildebeest killed by humans increases as human population increases, then there could be a permanent decline in wildebeest, and a major change in the whole ecosystem, because wildebeest are the keystone species. Continued monitoring is essential for conservation of the Serengeti ecosystem."
922,79,Effects of Slash Pine Silviculture on a Florida Population of Flatwoods Salamanders.,"The largest known breeding migration of the flatwoods salamander (Ambystoma cingulatum) was monitored over a 22-year period following its discovery in 1970 in Liberty County, Florida (U.S.A.). Nightly migrations of 200-300 adults across a 4.3-km stretch of paved highway in 1970-1972 had dwindled to less than one individual per night in 1990-1992; the decline apparently was already underway in the 1980s. We discuss possible natural and anthropogenic causes of the decline. The silvicultural practice of converting native longleaf pine savanna to bedded slash pine plantation, implemented on our study site about 1968, may have interfered with migration, successful hatching, larval life, feeding, and finding suitable cover post-metamorphosis. Longleaf pine-wiregrass flatwoods inhabited by adults have been drastically reduced and severely degraded throughout the coastal plain and may explain why the species is rare and deserving of threatened status."
923,3073,Effects of sea ice on breeding numbers and clutch size of a high arctic population of the common eider Somateria mollissima,"The breeding performance of high-arctic bird populations shows large inter-annual variation that may be attributed to environmental; variability, such as the timing of snow melt and break-up of the landfast sea ice that surrounds breeding colonies on; islands and along coasts. In the Kongsfjorden area (79N) on Svalbard, the number of breeding pairs and the average egg clutch size; vary considerably among years. In this study, data on breeding performance are presented from 15 years in the period 1981e2000.; The results showed that early break-up of sea ice in Kongsfjorden resulted in larger numbers of nests and larger average clutch sizes; than late break-up. Also, individual islands with early break-up of sea ice in a particular year had more nests and larger clutch sizes; compared to other islands surrounded by sea ice during a longer period in spring. Thus, the inter-annual variation in the break-up of; sea ice in the fjord has considerable implications for the inter-annual variability of recruitment to the population. The results; indicate that the effects of global warming on changes in the sea ice melting regime in coastal regions are important for the; reproductive output of island-nesting eiders."
924,3283,Autumn migration dynamics of the Dunlin (Calidris alpina) at the Reda Mouth (southern Baltic),"The study was conducted between 1996 and 2000 at one of the most  important stopover sites for waders migrating along the southern Baltic coast. Everyday counts and trapping were performed between mid-July and the end of September. This period covered almost the whole period of adult migration, and a little more than a half of the total period of passage of juveniles. The majority of adults passed the study area between mid-July and the third decade of August. After this period adults were still observed among migrated Dunlins, but their number was rather small.; In all seasons except 1996 second-year Dunlins migrated earlier than older birds, however migration periods of both groups overlapped to a large extent. First juveniles were recorded among migrating Dunlins as early as in the second decade of July. They belonged to the Baltic subspecies C. a. schinzii. The number of juveniles showed conspicuous increase not earlier than in the; last decade of August, when birds of C. a. alpina arrived. The intra-seasonal changes in numbers of adults and juveniles showed a clear wavy structure. Two waves seem to be the most common pattern of juvenile migration in the Baltic area. Different factors which might influence the observed variation of migration patterns are discussed. Among them the most important aspects; seem to be differences in migration timing between adult males and females and different geographical populations. Also local environmental conditions and weather situation on a route preceding a particular study site might influence the migration timing."
925,3281,"Trends in wader populations in the East Atlantic flyway as shown by numbers of  autumn migrants in W Denmark, 1964–2003","Many wader populations are estimated to be declining. These estimates are mainly based on mid-winter counts,; where much bias may occur in the form of varying geographical coverage, varying methods, birds changing; wintering sites from year to year or over longer time, and counting error. Other trend estimates derive from; breeding area data, which often are very uncertain due to the extreme geographical dispersal of most breeding; distributions. Here we present data on 17 wader species passing Blåvandshuk in W Denmark on autumn; migration during a 40-year period. Visible migration of birds including waders is highly sensitive to differing; weather conditions from year to year, but the data are unaffected by the biases mentioned for mid-winter counts.; The populations involved mainly originate from north boreal and arctic breeding sites from Greenland/Canada; in the west to central Siberia in the east. One species stands out showing significantly decreasing trends, namely; Eurasian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus. The Eurasian Oystercatchers passing Blåvandshuk mainly; originate from Norwegian breeding grounds, and the decrease corresponds to decreases on the wintering grounds; associated with overexploitation of bivalve stocks. Most other species showed relatively stable, fluctuating or; increasing trends, and according to our data, most north boreal and arctic wader populations on the East Atlantic; flyway seem to have been doing well during the last 40 years."
926,1686,"PRECIPITATION, LITTERFALL, AND THE DYNAMICS OF DENSITY AND BIOMASS IN THE BLACK-EARED OPOSSUM, DIDELPHIS AURITA","Density and biomass may reveal different aspects of the dynamics of populations, but most studies have focused on density or relative abundance. Density and biomass also may behave differently in parts of the population composed of males and females because of differences in vagility and parental care between sexes. Herein, we explore seasonal and multiannual variation in density and biomass in a population of black-eared opossums (Didelphis aurita). Females and males were analyzed separately for associations with precipitation and litterfall, indicators of resource availability. Litterfall, density, and biomass were estimated from 1997 to 2003 on three 0.64-ha trapping grids in an area of Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Density of females exhibited a significant increase during the study. Density and biomass of males were more variable, without any significant positive trend or correlation with precipitation or litterfall. Seasonal and biannual patterns of precipitation were detected, followed by the density and biomass of females with time lags varying from 0 to 1, and from 9 to 12 months. The relative stability of biomass of females, and its association with precipitation and litterfall, suggests that resource availability combined with density-dependent responses regulated the local population of females. The local population of males may be more influenced by the stochasticity resulting from the higher vagility of males. "
927,1880,A biomass dynamics assessment of the southeastern Caribbean snapper–grouper fishery,"Southern red snapper, Lutjanus purpureus, and yellowedge grouper, Epinephelus flavolimbatus, are the main species exploited by handliners and longliners of the Venezuelan medium range snapper-grouper fleet in the southeastern Caribbean. Catch and effort data for the period 1981-2000 are used to assess both species by means of a Schaefer biomass dynamic model. Due to lack of contrast in both time series empirical estimates of the intrinsic rate of population increase (r) were used as auxiliary information for fitting the model to the data. Model parameters and derived variables uncertainty was estimated using a conditioned non-parametric bootstrap with fixed r values and normally distributed r values with estimated coefficients of variation of 55% for yellowedge grouper and 42% for red snapper. Also, 10-year biomass projections under different catch scenarios for both species were used to assess the impact of fishing on future population levels. Results indicate that L. purpureus is more intensely exploited than E. flavolimbatus and biomass levels in the year 2000, depending on the initial biomass Bi hypothesis, were on average between 22% (Bi=0.5K) and 39% (B i=K) and 13% (Bi=0.5K) and 25% (Bi=K) of virgin biomass (K) for E. flavolimbatus and L. purpureus, respectively. Significant population recoveries are possible if catches are maintained at relatively low levels for both species, but biomass recovery to MSY levels depending on species and scenarios may require a longer time frame than the 10-year period used for projections.

928,1883,Changes in survival rates and population dynamics of greater snow geese over a 30-year period: Implications for hunting regulations,"1. In recent decades, the populations of several goose species have increased dramatically and are severely impacting on their habitat. We examined the relative contribution of reproduction and mortality to changes in the dynamics of the entire North American population of greater snow geese Anser caerulescens atlanticus from 1970 to 1998. 2. The total population increased 10-fold over this period, with two phases of rapid population growth in 1970-74 and 1984-98 separated by an intervening period of stagnation. The reproductive rate was estimated from age ratios in the autumn, survival from ring recoveries, and harvest rates from hunter surveys. 3. Variations in population growth could not be explained by changes in reproduction, which was similar across the three periods (overall mean 26 [plus or minus] 3% young in the autumn flock) with no evidence of density-dependence. 4. Adult survival did not differ between the two periods of rapid population growth (0.84 [plus or minus] 0.04 during 1970-74 vs. 0.80 [plus or minus] 0.04 during 1990-96), thus providing no evidence of density-dependence effects either. The survival rates of young could only be estimated during 1990-96, when they varied greatly (mean 0.36 [plus or minus] 0.12, annual range 0.11-0.48). 5. Adult harvest rates were much higher during the period of no population growth (0.11 [plus or minus] 0.01%) than before (0.04 [plus or minus] 0.01%) or after (0.06 [plus or minus] 0.01%). The increased harvest starting in 1975 was due to the re-opening of the US hunting season. Thus, reduced survival due to increased hunting mortality apparently caused the stagnation of growth between 1975 and 1983. 6. We conclude that hunting mortality has had the most impact on recent population dynamics in the greater snow goose and, in the absence of density-dependent effects, hunting could be used to limit the growth of this population."
929,1825,Evidence of Population Decline in Common Eiders Breeding in Western Greenland,"In the Arctic, there is great concern for several eider populations, including the northern common eider (Somateria mollissima borealis) breeding in Canada and Greenland. In 1998-2001, extensive ground surveys were conducted on 937 potential nesting islands in West Greenland, covering most of the districts of Ilulissat, Uummannaq, and Upernavik (69°15′N to 74°05′ N). On 216 islands within 106 eider colonies, 4097 ± 468 active nests were identified. In 15 colonies where comparable and well-documented surveys were conducted approximately 40 years ago, the study shows a population decline of 81% (from 3361 to 624 nests). A rough comparison shows that of 51 eider colonies surveyed in 1920, 1960, or 1965, 71% either were gone or had declined in breeding numbers when resurveyed in 1998-2001. At the colony level, the 1998-2001 surveys revealed large year-to-year variations in nesting numbers. The reason for the overall decline is not clear. However, there is circumstantial evidence that harvest of common eiders in West Greenland is a key factor. The results urgently call for more cautious management of the northern common eider population."
930,3768,Bison distribution under conflicting foraging strategies: site fidelity vs. energy maximization,"Foraging strategies based on site fidelity and maximization of energy intake rate are two adaptive forces shaping animal behavior. Whereas these strategies can both be evolutionarily stable, they predict conflicting optimal behaviors when population abundance is in decline. In such a case, foragers employing an energy-maximizing strategy should reduce their use of low-quality patches as interference competition becomes less intense for highquality patches. Foragers using a site fidelity strategy, however, should continue to use familiar patches. Because natural fluctuations in population abundance provide the only nonmanipulative opportunity to evaluate adaptation to these evolutionary forces, few studies have examined these foraging strategies simultaneously. Using abundance and space use data from a free-ranging bison (Bison bison) population living in a meadow-forest matrix in Prince Albert National Park, Canada, we determined how individuals balance the trade-off between site fidelity and energy-maximizing patch choice strategies with respect to changes in population abundance. From 1996 to 2005, bison abundance increased from 225 to 475 and then decreased to 225 by 2013. During the period of population increase, population range size increased. This expansion involved the addition of relatively less profitable areas and patches, leading to a decrease in the mean expected profitability of the range. Yet, during the period of population decline, we detected neither a subsequent retraction in population range size nor an increase in mean expected profitability of the range. Further, patch selection models during the population decline indicated that, as density decreased, bison portrayed stronger fidelity to previously visited meadows, but no increase in selection strength for profitable meadows. Our analysis reveals that an energy-maximizing patch choice strategy alone cannot explain the distribution of individuals and populations, and site fidelity is an important evolutionary force shaping animal distribution. Animals may not always forage in the richest patches available, as ecological theory would often predict, but their use of profitable patches is dependent on population dynamics and the strength of site fidelity. Our findings are likewise relevant to applied inquiries such as forecasting species range shifts and reducing human-wildlife conflicts."
931,1780,Alteration of fish diversity downstream from Petit-Saut Dam in French Guiana. Implication of ecological strategies of fish species,"Dams are expected to decrease fish diversity because they deeply alter downstream environment. However, such decline has not been consistently observed although profound modifications in the structure and/or composition of fish communities were generally recorded, and were linked to modifications of the downstream environment. In this work we analyze data from observations made before and almost 10 years after the completion of a hydroelectric dam in the neotropics. We monitored fish diversity below that dam and compared the taxonomic and functional structures of the samples between the pre- and post-dam periods. A significant decrease in species richness was evidenced. Taxonomic and trophic structures were significantly different between the two periods. Conversely, the functional structure of samples based on reproductive traits did not change significantly after the damming. Concerning feeding habits, a large increase in relative abundance of detritivores and a parallel decrease of fish species feeding on terrestrial food sources were observed in samples taken 6-9 years after closure of the dam as compared with samples taken before the dam. "
932,3941,Population dynamics and ecology of small mammals in the northern Chilean semiarid region,"Seven species were captured (6 rodents, 1 marsupial), but only 4 yielded sufficient captures for a quantitative study (3 sigmodontines, 1 hystricomorph). Reproduction was strongly seasonal, starting and ending earlier in Octodon degus and Akodon longipilis (July-November) than in Phyllotis darwini and Akodon olivaceus (September-January for the former, September-November for the latter). The latter 2 species may produce ↔1 litter per reproduction period. Data indicate a classification of individuals into a cohort of adults, one of young of the year and a ""cohort' of probable immigrants. Akodon olivaceus had low survival in reproductive months and low recruitment in the second year of study; this resulted in a steady population decline through the study period. Akodon longipilis had a high survival rate and low recruitment in both years, and showed very constant population numbers. Phyllotis darwini and O. degus had a generally lower survival, but showed a high potential rate of reproduction, albeit with low juvenile survival. Dispersal is probably a crucial feature in the demography of these two species. The fauna in this community was remarkably constant in overall numbers during 4yr of observation. Since the principal species studied here are widely distributed, physiologically and morphologically unspecialized for arid environments, and represent diverse trophic specializations, ecological adaptations and life history characteristics seem more important for their persistence and success than are biogeographical considerations or evolutionary preadaptations. -from Authors"
933,662,Population Dynamics and Status of Crocodylus porosus in the Tidal Waterways of Northern Australia,"The results of 10 years of systematic, standardized, night-time surveys of C. porosus in c. 100 tidal waterways in northern Australia are presented. One group of waterways in Arnhem Land has been studied intensively, especially over the last 4 years; others have been surveyed at least once and many several times. The results indicate a basically steady total population, with some signs of an increase in the proportion of large animals. As total protection has been accorded C. porosus since 1972, these results are perhaps surprising. The results of our surveys and studies have allowed a picture of C. porosus population dynamics in northern Australia to be developed, and this is presented in some detail. It enables us to account in a consistent fashion for the results of the surveys and to predict results to be expected on future surveys. The results also enable us to make an assessment of the overall status of C. porosus in northern Australia, and of the prospects for recovery of the population. Management implications of the results and population model are also discussed. "
934,1466,The Significance of Limiting and Regulating Factors on the Demography of Moose and White-tailed Deer.,"Used long-term data on the demography of moose Alces alces on Isle Royale, Michigan, and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus in the National Superior Forest, NE Minnesota. Wolf Canis lupus predation and food competition explained 80% of the interannual variation of moose abundance. Snow accumulation had no quantifiable effect on moose numbers. Competition for food, but not wolf predation and snow, had a regulatory impact on moose. Wolf predation was inversely related to moose density; the relationship differed between periods of moose expansion and reduction. The dual density relationship of wolf predation may explain population cyclicity of moose at elevated densities. Significant inverse relationships were found between deer population growth and relative wolf density, as well as with deer density. Snow had no measurable effect on deer numbers. -from Author"
935,3004,Long-term changes in bird communities after wildfires in the Central Brazilian Amazon,"We examined long-term responses of an Amazonian bird assemblage to wildfire disturbance, investigating how understory birds reacted to forest regeneration 1, 3, and 10 years after a widespread fire event. The bird community was sampled along the Arapiuns and Maró river catchments in central Brazilian Amazonia. Sampling took place in 1998, 2000, and 2008 using mist-nets in eight plots (four burned, four unburned sites). Species richness did not change significantly in unburned sites. In burned sites, however, we found significantly lower richness in 1998, higher richness in 2000, and similar richness in 2008. Multi-dimensional scaling ordination showed consistent differences in bird communities both within burned sites sampled in different sampling years, and between burned and unburned sites in all years. Of the 30 most abundant species, 12 had not recovered 10 years after the fires, including habitat specialists such as mixed flocks specialists and ant-followers. Fire-disturbance favored three species (two hummingbirds and a manakin) in the short term only. All other species were either favored throughout the study (seven species of omnivores and small insectivores) or did not show a clear response (eight species). In burned sites, we also found significantly lower abundance of species sensitive to disturbances and habitat specialists over the entire study period. Although the bird community seems to be recovering in terms of richness, the overall community composition and abundance of some species in post-burned and unburned sites remain very different, and have not recovered after 10 years of forest regeneration.

936,3696,Going the extra mile: Ground-based monitoring of olive ridley turtles reveals Gabon hosts the largest rookery in the Atlantic,"The management of widely dispersed marine vertebrates can be facilitated by better understanding their distribution, density, population trends and threats. Unfortunately, for some populations of sea turtle spatial and temporal data are often lacking, particularly along the Atlantic coast of Africa, a region which is considered globally important. Here we combined spatially limited monitoring data from four nesting beaches over seven seasons with an extensive ground-based coastal survey that covered 585 km of Gabons Atlantic coast, to provide the first population assessment for the olive ridley turtle Lepidochelys olivacea. This species is currently classified as data deficient by the IUCN in the eastern Atlantic and so is considered a regional conservation priority. Whilst the logistics required to undertake such a comprehensive ground-based census were complicated, the method proved extremely effective in providing population estimates for a widely dispersed marine vertebrate and demonstrates the importance of focusing beyond intensively monitored beaches. In particular, our findings reveal that the presence of nesting activity spans almost the entirety of Gabons coast, the density of which subsequently reveals that Gabon hosts one of the most important olive ridley rookeries in the Atlantic (23709814 clutches, approximating to 9485452 breeding females per annum and a total estimate of 14228178 breeding females), with a significant proportion, 81 ± 3.5% (mean ± 1 S.D.) of total nesting effort occurring within protected areas. These findings thus complement our existing knowledge base and further emphasise the regional and global importance of Gabons nesting sea turtle populations."
937,1225,"Analysis of three amphibian populations with quarter-century long time-series, ","Amphibians are in decline in many parts of the world. Long time-series of amphibian populations are necessary to distinguish declines from the often strong fluctuations observed in natural populations. Time-series may also help to understand the causes of these declines. We analysed 23-28-year long time-series of the frog Rana temporaria. Only one of the three studied populations showed a negative trend which was probably caused by the introduction of fish. Two populations appeared to be density regulated. Rainfall had no obvious effect on the population fluctuations. Whereas long-term studies of amphibian populations are valuable to document population declines, most are too short to reveal those factors that govern population dynamics or cause amphibian populations to decline."
938,2635,Seasonal cycles and long-term trends in abundance and species composition of sharks associated with cage diving ecotourism activities in Hawaii,"Shark cage diving is both popular and controversial, with proponents citing educational value and non-extractive use of natural resources and opponents raising concerns about public safety and ecological impacts. Logbook data collected 2004-2008 from two Oahu (Hawaii) shark cage diving operations were analysed to determine whether such voluntary records provide useful insights into shark ecology or ecotourism impacts. Operators correctly identified common shark species and documented gross seasonal cycles and long-term trends in abundance of Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis), sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and tiger sharks (Galeorcerdo cuvier). Annual cycles in shark abundance may indicate seasonal migrations, whereas long-term trends suggest gradual exclusion of smaller sandbar sharks from cage diving sites. Numerically dominant (> 98%) Galapagos and sandbar sharks are rarely implicated in attacks on humans. Negligible impact on public safety is supported by other factors such as: (1) remoteness of the sites, (2) conditioning stimuli that are specific to the tour operations and different from inshore recreational stimuli and (3) no increase in shark attacks on the north coast of Oahu since cage diving started. Tracking studies are required to validate logbook data and to determine whether sharks associated with offshore cage diving travel into inshore areas used for in-water recreation."
939,4426,Decline in an Atlantic puffin population: evaluation of magnitude and mechanisms,"Determining which demographic and ecological parameters contribute to variation in population growth rate is crucial to understanding the dynamics of declining populations. This study aimed to evaluate the magnitude and mechanisms of an apparent major decline in an Atlantic Puffin Fratercula arctica population. This was achieved using a 27-year dataset to estimate changes in population size and in two key demographic rates: adult survival and breeding success. Estimated demographic variation was then related to two ecological factors hypothesised to be key drivers of demographic change, namely the abundance of the main predator at the study site, the Great Skua Stercorarius skua, and Atlantic Puffin chick food supply, over the same 27-year period. Using a population model, we assessed whether estimated variation in adult survival and reproductive success was sufficient to explain the population change observed. Estimates of Atlantic Puffin population size decreased considerably during the study period, approximately halving, whereas Great Skua population estimates increased, approximately trebling. Estimated adult Atlantic Puffin survival remained high across all years and did not vary with Great Skua abundance; however, Atlantic Puffin breeding success and quantities of fish prey brought ashore by adults both decreased substantially through the period. A population model combining best possible demographic parameter estimates predicted rapid population growth, at odds with the long-term decrease observed. To simulate the observed decrease, population models had to incorporate low immature survival, high immature emigration, or increasingly high adult non-breeding rates. We concluded that reduced recruitment of immatures into the breeding population was the most likely cause of population decrease. This study showed that increase in the size of a predator population does not always impact on the survival of adult prey and that reduced recruitment can be a crucial determinant of seabird population size but can easily go undetected."
940,4011,Life on the Edge: The Demography of Short-Season Populations of Deer Mice,"We documented populations of deer mice in the Kananaskis Valley, southwestern Alberta, Canada from 1979 to 1997 to determine whether these short-season popula- tions were more, or less, variable than populations in more temperate environments. We then examined patterns of reproduction, age-specific survival, and immigration to explain variation in summer population growth. Population densities showed no multi-annual periodicity and were generally low. At maximum, numbers doubled over the breeding season, but declined over the breeding season in 4 of 16 yr. Variability in population density was low, and similar to that of Peromyscus populations in more temperate environments. No demographic parameters were related to spring population densities, and immigration rates were low when condi- tions for survival of nestlings and adults were favorable. Variation in summer population growth was attributed primarily to variation in nestling survival among years."
941,3522,"Life history, ecology, and long-term demographics of queenfish","Queenfish Seriphus politus were collected at coastal power plants from San Clemente to Ventura, California. Power functions best described relations between otolith length, width, or weight and either standard length (SL) or total body weight. The length-weight relationship was described by the following equation: weight 1/4 10-5 × SL3.09. Individuals were aged to 12 years by using sagittal otolith sections. Females grew at a significantly faster rate than males. Both sexes reached 50% maturity by 100 mm SL, or shortly after age 1. The total annual instantaneous mortality coefficient was estimated at 0.42. Catalina Harbor (on the windward side of Santa Catalina Island) and Ventura were the most populous sites based on gill-net catch per unit effort from 1995 to 2006. Juvenile and adult queenfish populations have declined since 1980 in a significant relationship with nearshore plankton biomass. Larval queenfish densities recorded in King Harbor (Redondo Beach) have declined since 1987. Long-term recruitment estimates indicated peak recruitment prior to 1976, with three subsequent downward baseline shifts. "
942,725,"Catastrophic die-off of Peary caribou on the Western Queen Elizabeth Islands, Canadian high arctic","The Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) is an endangered species in Canada, having been in an overall decline since 1961. Sightings of Peary caribou were compared from two aerial searches, in 1993 and 1998, on Bathurst and its neighbouring islands, western Queen Elizabeth Islands in the Canadian High Arctic. The comparison indicated a near-total (98%) cataclysmic decline in the number of Peary caribou seen per unit of search effort. In summer 1993, 2400 caribou were counted during 33.8 h of low-level helicopter searches. In contrast, in summer 1998, only 43 caribou were seen within the same area during 35.2 h of low-level helicopter searches. The frequency of observation was markedly different: 118.3 caribou/100 min in 1993, but only 2.0 caribou/100 min in 1998. The number of carcasses indicated that the decline resulted from deaths and not from mass emigration. Males died at a disproportionately higher rate than females among all 1+ yr old caribou, and bulls (4+ yr) compared to cows (3+ yr) had died at an even greater rate. Widespread, prolonged, exceptionally severe snow and ice conditions from 1994-95 to 1996-97 caused the die-off. Trends in snowfall are consistent with predictions for global warming in the western Canadian High Arctic. Future climate change may increase the frequency of years with unfavorable snow and ice conditions, which could prevent or at least impede future recovery of Peary caribou populations on the western Queen Elizabeth Islands, particularly to sizes that would support subsistence harvesting."
943,4466,At-sea distribution and habitat of breeding Japanese murrelets Synthliboramphus wumizusume: implications for conservation management,"The Japanese Murrelet Synthliboramphus wumizusume is a rare, globally 'Vulnerable' seabird, endemic to Japan and South Korea. However, little is known of its at-sea distribution, habitat or threats. We conducted several years of at-sea surveys around Japan to model Japanese Murrelet density in relation to habitat parameters, and make spatial predictions to assess the adequacy of the current Japanese marine Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) network for the species. During a five-year period, 3,485 km of at-sea surveys recorded 3,161 Japanese Murrelets around four breeding locations. Maximum murrelet group size was 90 individuals with a mean group size of 2.9 ± 4.2 individuals. Models of Japanese Murrelet at-sea density around the two largest breeding locations predicted that almost all murrelets occur within 30 km of the breeding colony and most within 10 km. Murrelets were predicted closer to the colony in May than in April and closer to the colony at a neritic colony than at an offshore island colony. Additionally, murrelets breeding on an offshore island colony also commuted to mainland neritic habitat for foraging. The marine habitat used by Japanese Murrelets differed between each of the four surveyed colonies, however oceanographic variables offered little explanatory power in models. Models with colony, month and year generated four foraging radii (9-39 km wide) containing murrelet densities of > 0.5 birds/km2. Using these radii the Japanese marine IBA network was found to capture between 95% and 25% of Japanese Murrelet at-sea habitat while breeding and appears appropriately configured to protect near-colony murrelet distributions. Given the range of marine habitats that breeding murrelets inhabit, our simple models offer an applicable method for predicting to unsampled colonies and generating ecologically-informed seaward extension radii. However, data on colony populations and further at-sea surveys are necessary to refine models and improve predictions."
944,3988,Recent Population Decline of the Marbled Murrelet in the Pacific Northwest,"We document here a decline of nearly 30% in the Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) population of washington, Oregon, and northern California between 2000 and 2010. The Northwest forest Plan is an ecosystem-management plan for federal forest lands in the Pacific Northwest of the United States that incorporates monitoring to determine if species' conservation objectives are met. To evaluate the plan's effectiveness in conserving populations of the murrelet, a species associated with older, late-successional forests, we estimated the murrelet's density in near-shore marine waters of washington, Oregon, and northern California south to San francisco bay. we sampled annually, using line transects and distance estimation. we divided the study area of about 8800 km2 into fve geographic subareas corresponding to existing murrelet-conservation zones. Annual population estimates for the plan ranged from an estimated 23 700 (95% CI: 18 300 to 29 000) birds in 2002 to a low of 16 700 (95% CI: 13 100 to 20 300) in 2010, representing an average rate of decline of 3.7% annually (95% CI: -4.8 to -2.7%) from 2001 to 2010. This annual rate suggests a total decline of about 29% during this period. we documented downward trends for washington (conservation zone 1) and for the outer coast of washington (conservation zone 2). These declines coincide with reductions in the amount of nesting habitat. further research to evaluate the potential marine and terrestrial factors responsible for the declines is planned. "
945,1889,"Predator population dynamics under a cyclic prey regime: numerical responses, demographic parameters and growth rates","The consequences of cyclic fluctuations in abundance of prey species on predator continue to improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind population regulation. Among predators, vole-eating raptors usually respond to changes in prey abundance with no apparent time-lag and therefore contradict predictions from the predator-prey theory. In such systems, the interplay between demographic traits and population growth rate in relation to prey abundance remains poorly studied, yet it is crucial to characterize the link between ecological processes and population changes. Using a mechanistic approach, we assessed the demographic rates associated to the direct and indirect numerical responses of a specialist raptor (Montagu's harrier) to its cyclic prey (common vole), using long term data from two adjacent study sites in France. First-year survival rates were weakly affected by vole abundance, probably due to the fact that Montagu's harriers are trans-Saharan migrants and thus escape the vole collapse occurring in autumn-winter. Recruitment of yearling as well as breeding propensity of experienced adult females were strongly affected by vole abundance and at least partially shaped the trajectory of the breeding population. We argued that the strong density dependent signal detected in predator time series was mostly the phenomenological consequence of the positive direct numerical response of harriers to vole abundance. Accounting for this, we proposed a method to assess density dependence in predator relying on a cyclic prey. Finally, the variation in Montagu's harrier population growth rates was best explained by overwinter growth rates of the prey population and to a lesser extent by previous residual predator density.

946,4036,Long-term population trends of the red-legged cormorant Phalacrocorax gaimardi on the Argentine coast,"The world population of Red-legged Cormorant Phalacrocorax gaimardi is reasonably small and has showed rapid declines. In Argentina, this species breeds in 13 localities and is considered as Endangered by the national government. In this study, we provide information about population trends of the Red-legged Cormorant on the Argentine coast, between 1990 and 2009. We also discuss whether these trends could be related to sea surface temperature and marine primary productivity, both of which are considered oceanographic factors that can affect breeding seabirds. The long-term trend in the breeding population showed a slight decrease of 1.2% per year. Seven colonies showed an average population change < 1. Periods of stability and increase were identified over the study period, but they were insufficient to compensate for the decreases. The largest colony of Red-legged Cormorants (La Mina, with more than 55% of the entire breeding population) seems to determine the overall population trend. We did not find a direct relationship between the overall number of Red legged Cormorants and the two oceanographic factors analysed. However, our analysis detected a positive effect of ocean productivity close to the coast on the largest colony at the beginning of the breeding season, suggesting that coastal ocean productivity could be an important factor affecting temporal variations in the Argentinian population."
947,2889,Recruitment patterns and factors affecting recruitment of five species of short-lived clupeoids in the tropical South Pacific,"The temporal and spatial patterns of recruitment of the short-lived anchovies Encrusicholinu deuisi; and Encruskholinu heterolohus, and the clupeoids Sprutelloides delicatulus, Spratelloide,s grucilis; and Sp-utellnides lewisi between 1984 and 1989 were examined at one or more sites in the Solomon; Islands, Papua New Guinea and Maldives. At all sites, all species recruited throughout the year. There; was no difference between months in the proportion of recruits in the fished population of any species; at any site.; The relative abundance of recruits of E. decisi, E. heterolobus, S. de1icatuZu.s and S. lewisi between; 1984 and I989 was examined at Munda and Tulagi in the Solomon Islands. There were no detectable; differences between months or sites for any species, although the interannual variability in recruitment; in some months was quite high. Both the relative abundance of recruits and variation in recruitment; ol both Encrusicholinu species were correlated at both sites.; Adult stock size was the most important factor that explained variation in recruitment 2 months; later and accounted for between 30 and 85% of the variation in recruitment of each species at the two; sites. Environmental factors such as zooplankton biomass, wind or monthly rainfall were not correlated; with recruitment of any species at either site. Nor was predation by adults an important source of egg; or larval mortality. All species preyed on Encrasicholina eggs and larvae at some time during the; year and G1c.rusicholinu species were the most important predators at both sites. However, unlike; some temperate clupeoids. these species ate less than I % of the estimated daily egg production each; month during the study.; Overall. there was little variation in recruitment of Encrusicholinu or Sprutel1oide.s species. Most; of the monthly estimates of the relative abundance of recruits of each species did not differ from the; long-term mean at each site by more than an order of magnitude. We hypothesise that the lower; variability in recruitment compared with temperate clupeoids results from a combination of their; multiple-spawning reproductive strategy, rapid growth and early recruitment. For these species, prerecruit; mortality appears to be relatively constant."
948,694,Breeding population fluctuations in some raptors,"We investigated differences in annual breeding population stability and its relationship to diversity in food habits for several species of raptors. Chi-square tests showed no significant differences between observed and expected (based on logistic growth equation) breeding population sizes for Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) during recovery from pesticide induced declines in 4 Alaskan populations. This indicates that no major Peregrine Falcon population fluctuations occurred aside from the recovery itself. On the Colville River, Alaska, Rough-legged Hawk (Buteo lagopus) and Gyrfalcon (F. rusticolus) breeding populations experienced several declines and increases during the Peregrine Falcon recovery. Serial correlation analysis does not indicate consistent regularity in fluctuation for either the Rough-legged Hawk or Gyrfalcon on the Colville River during 1967-1985. Possible occurrence of regular fluctuations in sub-populations or over shorter time periods, however, could not be investigated. Population fluctuations for the Rough-legged Hawk and Gyrfalcon are significantly correlated during 1971-1985, with largest declines for both occurring synchronously. This correlation is consistent with the possibility that shared environmental stresses, among other factors, are responsible for population limitation. Regularity, with a 3 year interval, is indicated, however, for extremely small fluctuations in an Idaho, USA population of the Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), suggesting that investigations of raptor population fluctuation and regelarity should not be limited to arctic or subarctic environments. Low diversity in food habits is not a good predictor of degree of annual population fluctuation in the study groups, while greater diversity in food habits is associated with relatively stable annual populations. An association was found in the Rought-legged Hawk between reduced annual population variability and reduced climatic severity. Neither food habits diversity nor annual population variability is constant across species ranges. Food habits diversity was also variable between years in local populations of Peregrine Falcon, Rough-legged Hawk and Gyrfalcon. "

950,3847,Ruaha-Rungwa ecosystem elephant census results,"The Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism wishes to announce results of elephant census verification exercise that was conducted in the Ruaha-Rungwa Ecosystem during the dry season from 16th September to 13th November 2015. The main objective of the survey was to verify the unprecedented low estimate of elephant population estimated in 2014 compared to the previous estimate of 2013.  Results of the 2014 census indicated a decline from 20,090 (±3.282 Standard Error) to 8,272 (±1,652 Standard Error) over a period of one year, while the estimated number of carcasses did not change. The Ministry, in collaboration with experts from within and outside the country, conducted the verification surveys which included aerial census, camera traps and questionnaire surveys. Results of the 2015 aerial census provided an estimate of 15,836 (±4,759 Standard Error) elephants in the Ruaha-Rungwa Ecosystem. This means the true elephant population size is between 11,077 and 20,595 within one standard error. This estimate encompasses both the 2013 and 2014 estimates because of its relatively wide standard error. The estimated number of elephant carcasses in the Ruaha-Rungwa census zone was 2,863 (±318 SE), which is statistically similar to the two censuses conducted in 2013 and 2014. The carcass ratio in the ecosystem was high (15.3%) indicating a population that is still suffering from unnatural mortality (carcass ratio of about 7 to 8% is considered to represent natural mortality).  However, no fresh carcasses were recorded and only 9% were assessed to have died between 2 and 12 months ago. The remaining 91% of the carcasses spans over a long period from over one year up to 10 years ago. Lack of fresh carcasses and few recent elephant deaths are most likely due to effective protection measures taken by management authorities."
951,2747,"History and status of moose in the Rostov region, Russia","Moose (Alces alces) disappeared from the Rostov region in the 19th century due to agricultural development, hunting, and deforestation. They reappeared in the second half of the 20th century due to broad conservation measures including intensive forest management, and by the 1970s numbered >1000 and were found throughout the region. Although hunting was regulated, the population became stagnant in the 1980s presumably from trophy hunting that skewed the sex and age structure, as well as measurable wolf (Canis lupus) predation. Political reform in the 1990s further caused population decline due to increased and less regulated hunting, increased poaching without punishment, reduced predator control, decline in forest management, and large forest fires. Currently the population is at a 50-year low and occupies 1/3 of its range in the 1980s. Moose are no longer considered a commercial species, rather a species of concern."
952,3129,"Trends of shorebirds in Corner Inlet, Victoria, 1982-2011.","Corner Inlet, Victoria, provides habitat for one of the largest and most diverse assemblages of shorebirds in southern Australia. Systematic counting commenced in 1981 and has continued, uninterrupted, to the present (2011). Standardised counts, along fixed boat routes, indicate that numbers in summer of all species combined have declined by 23% over the 30 year count period, from typically 35-40,000 in the earlier years to 25-30,000 in recent times. Ten species - Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola, Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres, Eastern Curlew Numenius madagascariensis, Red Knot Calidris canutus, Great Knot Calidris tenuirostris, Curlew Sandpiper Calidris ferruginea, Sharp-tailed Sandpiper Calidus acuminata, Common Greenshank Tringa nebularia, Greater Sand Plover Charadrius leschenaulti, and Lesser Sand Plover C. mongolus - have declined, while Sooty Oystercatcher Haematopus fuliginosus, has increased. Numbers of five other migratory species -Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica, Whimbrel Numenius phaepus, Red-necked Stint Calidris ruficollis, Sanderling C. alba and Double-banded Plover Charadrius bicinctus and one resident, species, Australian Pied Oystercatcher Haematopus longirostris - have not shown any significant change. Estimated declines in the abundance of individual species ranged from 47% to 95%. In contrast there was a significant increase in Sooty Oystercatchers of between 1.5 fold (winter) and 3.5 fold (summer). Numbers counted varied widely between years, most likely due to a combination of annual variation in demographic parameters, and possibly detection rates. The cause of longterm changes in abundance at Corner Inlet is not certain, but habitat destruction in staging areas, notably the Yellow Sea regions of China and Korea, is suggested as the main contributor with related changes in adult survival rates a more likely mechanism than changes in breeding success. Interestingly, declines in several species were most pronounced over one or two years. This study emphasises the benefit of using the same route and observers over long periods to identify trends in abundance."
953,120,"Population and conservation status of the Nilgiri tahr Hemitragus hylocrius in Anamalai Hills, south India.","The endangered Nilgiri tahr Hemitragus hylocrius is endemic to the Western Ghats mountains in south India. The largest existing population inhabits the Anamalai conservation unit (Anamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary, and Eravikulam National Park) straddling the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. We undertook a survey to assess the conservation status of Nilgiri tahr in the Anamalai-Parambikulam area of the conservation unit. Altogether, 348 tahr were sighted in 12 separate grassland areas, including two populations which had not been recorded previously. The present population of Nilgiri tahr in Anamalai and Parambikulam sanctuaries is estimated to be between 570 and 690 animals. Together with the Eravikulam population, the Anamalai conservation unit therefore contains some 1400 Nilgiri tahr. We found evidence of poaching in five of the 12 areas surveyed. Tahr habitat is also threatened by the spread of wattle Acacia mearnsii in one area, and by extensive livestock grazing in another. Comparisons are made with the successful conservation measures taken in Eravikulam and recommendations made for control of poaching in Anamalai-Parambikulam area."

955,2981,Group Activity and Population Dynamics of the Howler Monkey on Barro Colorado Island,"The mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata) of Barro Colorado Island, Panama Canal Zone, was studied in the late rainy season of 1970. Group ranges, group activity patterns and population size and structure were recorded for six groups in a 204 hectare ""study area."" A new ""trail survey method"" was introduced to determine the population size of the entire island. Using this method, a population of 923±125 animals is estimated. Factors affecting group stability and group density are discussed. Rainfall appears to be a major determinant of howler activity and group movement in the late rainy season. "
956,1337,The ibex Capra pyrenaica returns to its former Portuguese range,"The ibex Capra pyrenaica has recently recolonized its former Portuguese range from a contiguous Spanish protected area. The first observations of ibex in Portugal were in Peneda-Gerês National Park in 1998. In 2001 we began a survey to confirm ibex presence in Portuguese territory, and to determine the current status of the species there. There are three ibex nuclei in the general area of the international border, and they are expanding their geographical range with two of the nuclei almost restricted to Portuguese territory. In 2003 the ibex population consisted of a minimum of 75 individuals. Different founder histories have led to distinct age structures in each nucleus, but in general they exhibit the population dynamics typical of a recently reintroduced population with high reproductive potential. Priority conservation actions for this newly established population need to include increased monitoring, and reinforcement of the population with individuals from elsewhere. Effective conservation will require collaboration between staff of both Portuguese and Spanish protected areas and an integrated Spanish-Portuguese conservation plan. "
957,3650,"Changes in relative abundance of the western green lizard Lacerta bilineata and the common wall lizard Podarcis muralis introduced onto Boscombe Cliffs, Dorset, UK","Introduced populations of Lacerta bilineata and Podarcis muralis were discovered on Boscombe cliffs in 2002. Since then both species have been breeding successfully. This investigation plotted their territory in 2007 and compared their population trends with that of the native Zootoca vivipara. Fifteen survey visits were undertaken between April and September 2007 during which time observations were made of 214 non-native and 44 native lizards. The two introduced species dominated the central area of the site with the native species found in substantial numbers only on the periphery. Comparison with previously collected survey data show that the relative abundance of non-native species has increased; between 2002 and 2007 P. muralis increased by 40% and L. bilineata by 36%; compared with Z. vivipara which declined by 75%. Sufficient habitat favourable to the introduced species means that there is the potential for unimpeded range expansion along the cliffs, which raises concern for a sand lizard Lacerta agilis population to the west of this site. Eradication of the non-native species may be impractical because they occur on a relatively inaccessible cliff face."
958,2877,,"Peregrine Falcon Faco peregrinus of the Jura Mountain which population was crumbling before 1970 saw it's population increase almost 7 fold between 1974 and 2007. From 1990, the complete occupation of favourable sites has led new pairs to establish their nest on cliffs more vulnerable both to weather conditions and terrestrial predators. These changes have produced a natural constraint to the development of the population, more important than limitations linked to food resources - as the breeding rate of reproductive pairs has not changed much since the end of the 1970's. Stabilisation, even decline, of the population initiated in 2002 seems to be related more to the expansion Eagle Owl Bubo bubo than to disturbances by human outdoor activities or new chemical contamination by products such as PCBs."
959,2221,The distribution and conservation of the Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrius in Catalonia,"Recent changes in the size and distribution of breeding populations of the Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus in Catalonia are analysed. The overall breeding population is probably over 1650 pairs, mostly concentrated at the Ebro Delta. The Llobregat Delta, the Aiguamolls de l'Emporda, and Torredembarra-Creixell also hold important populations. However, most of the localities are used irregularly, by a very few pairs. The intensive tourist use of beaches, as well as the destruction of dune vegetation, are the main problems facing the conservation of the species in Catalonia. Predation comes mostly from gulls and magpies, while feral dogs and cats can be important sources of disturbance in some areas. Outside the Ebro Delta, the conservation of the species depends on the successful management of beaches to make conservation compatible with human activities. The use of successful management techniques to other localities, and the accurate determination of population trends at the Ebro Delta are the most important measures that can be adopted for the conservation of the species in Catalonia."
960,3419,Centurial and decadal oceanographic influences on changes in northern gannet populations and diets in the north-west Atlantic: implications for climate change,"Millennial and centurial changes in oceanography influence the distributions and movement patterns of fish and invertebrates. These changes, in turn, determine the availability of food resources for higher trophic levels and, hence, affect the distributions and abundances of marine birds. A century-long population trend of northern gannets (Sula bassana) is correlated with warming surface water conditions and increased mackerel (Scomber scombrus) availability. On a decadal scale, a major dietary change of breeding gannets from migratory warm-water pelagic fish and squids to cold-water fish is associated with cold-water perturbations in the north-west Atlantic during the 1990s. Cold-water influences appear to have inhibited migratory pelagic fish and squid from moving into the region in recent years, causing a major shift in pelagic food webs on the Newfoundland Shelf. Such findings imply that slight changes in oceanographic conditions, possibly associated with climate warming, could have large-scale and pervasive effects on seabird distributions, feeding ecology, reproductive success, and populations. Such changes might be detected initially near the limits of seabird ranges and the margins of oceanographic regions."
961,4369,"The vulnerable Osprey breeding population of the Al Hoceima National Park, Morocco: present status and threats","In the Mediterranean, most areas belonging to the initial distribution range of the Osprey Pandion haliaetus have been lost and local populations have disappeared in recent decades because of persecution. Even though direct management actions have allowed local partial recovery, the Mediterranean population currently only holds a few tens of breeding pairs and is still exposed to local extinction risks. One of the last Mediterranean Osprey breeding areas lies along the North African coast between Morocco and Algeria. In this paper, we report new information on the Osprey population within the Al Hoceima National Park, Morocco. The status of the population for 2012 and 2013 is reported and compared with data collected during the period 1983-1990. A reduction in number of nests and breeding pairs was observed and a 35.7% decrease in the population size recorded. In addition, we discuss the main identified threats to Osprey habitats (e.g. dynamite and poison fishing) that affect the Osprey breeding population in this area. In this context, we stress the necessity for urgent measures to be adopted at the local scale for the protection of this vulnerable population in the light of a sound conservation strategy also at the scale of the Mediterranean.

962,2059,"Survival and abundance of stocked striped bass in Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia","Survival rates and abundance of striped bass Morone saxatilis in Smith Moutain Lake, an 8,337-hectare hydroelectric reservoir in south-central Virginia, were derived from gillnet statistics and creel survey estimates supplied by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. Mean annual survival of striped bass age-1 and older was 40%. First-year survival of stocked striped bass fingerlings averaged 20.8% for an 11-year period (1973-1984) and ranged from 3.9 to 54.3%. There was a significant inverse correlation (r = -0.7bk, N = 11, P + 0.016) between the number of stocked fingerlings and the associated survival rates. Based on this relationship, and annual stocking rate of 200,000-250,000 fingerlings would optimize the number of year-class recruits. Survival estimates applied to stocking rates indicated that 136,227 (16.3/hectare) age-1 and older stiped bass were in Smith Mountain Lake in 1983."

In 1992, 140 landing sites were found, 32 fewer sites than in 1988, although a new area with 14 birds was found on the Col coast. Counts at 11 landing sites were used as an index for population change from 1987 to 1998. These showed that penguin numbers decreased between 1988 and 1992, stayed low until 1994 and then began to increase again. Population trends differed in degree and timing at the three bays of Northwest Bay and at Southeast Harbour and, by 1998, total counts at the former area were still only 50% of that found in 1988, whereas at the latter they were 41% higher."
964,1404,Gray whales distribution relative to forage habitat in the northern Bering Sea: current conditions and retrospective summary,"Hundreds of gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) stranded dead along beaches from Mexico to Alaska in 1999 and 2000. The cause of the mortalities remains unknown, but starvation resulting from a reduction in prey, especially in the Chirikov Basin, was suggested as the cause. In the 1980s, the Chirikov Basin was considered a prime gray whale feeding area, but there has been no recent comprehensive assessment of whale or prey distribution and abundance. In 2002, a 5-day survey for gray whales revealed restricted distribution in the basin and a 3- to 17-fold decline in sighting rates. To put these data in context, a retrospective summary of gray whale and benthic fauna distribution and abundance was undertaken. During the 1980s, gray whale sighting rates in the Chirikov Basin were highly variable. Ampeliscid amphipods dominated the benthos where gray whale sighting rates were highest. Available measures of biomass suggest a downturn in amphipod productivity from 1983 to 2000, when estimates of gray whale population size were increasing, suggesting that the whales simply expanded their foraging range. We encourage long-term study of the Chirikov Basin as a location where predator-prey responses to changing ocean climate can be researched, because decadal time series data are available."
965,4251,Assessing the impact of conservation agreements on threatened fish species: a case study in the Colombian Amazon,"Although biodiversity has value for the global community, biodiversity protection often imposes costs on local communities. Correcting this misalignment requires appropriate local incentives. Conservation agreements (i.e. negotiated transactions in which conservation investors finance social benefits in return for conservation actions by communities) are a form of direct incentive. The results of this approach depend on effective monitoring of ecological and socio-economic impacts to verify that environmental and development objectives are met. Monitoring is also needed to verify that parties to the agreements comply with their commitments. Ecological monitoring results for agreements between Conservation International and communities in the Colombian Amazon show positive conservation impacts. These agreements are designed to protect forest areas and two threatened fish species that are important to local livelihoods and have high commercial value. We show how effective monitoring is essential for identifying long-term sustainability options. Lessons learned from this project inform reflection on emerging frameworks for scaling up the approach to the national level."
966,3657,"Long-term and short-term effects of temperature on snake detectability in the wild: a case study with <i xmlns=""http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/"">Malpolon monspessulanus</i>","The relationship between temperature and rates of detection of the Mediterranean snake <i xmlns=""http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/"">Malpolon monspessulanus</i> (Montpellier snake) in the wild was analysed over a 26-year period. We used records of live and freshly road-killed snakes in south-eastern Spain. A short-term effect of temperature on rates of snake detection was found: the higher the yearly temperature, the higher the snake detectability was that year. Moreover, a long-term effect of temperature on snake detectability was found, as snake abundance in year x was also strongly affected by temperature during year x&#8211; 1 and x&#8211;2. A multiple-regression model demonstrated that these effects were independent. These long-term effects are probably due to an effect of temperature on snake population dynamics."
967,1901,Fluctuating abundance of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in a calving ground off coastal Brazil,"The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) population that uses Abrolhos Bank, off the east coast of Brazil as a breeding ground is increasing. To describe temporal changes in the relative abundance of humpback whales around Abrolhos, seven years (1998-2004) of whale count data were collected during July through to November. During one-hour-scans, observers determined group size within 9.3 km (5 n.m.) of a land-based observing station. A total Of 930 scans, comprising 7996 sightings of adults and 2044 calves were analysed using generalized linear models that included variables for time of day, day of the season, years and two-way interactions as possible predictors. The pattern observed was the gradual build-up and decline in whale counts within seasons. Patterns and peaks of adult and calf counts varied among years. Although fluctuation was observed, there was generally an increasing trend in adult counts among years. Calf counts increased only in 2004. These fluctuations may have been caused by some environmental conditions in humpback whales' summering grounds and also by changes in spatial-temporal concentrations in Abrolhos Bank. The general pattern observed within the study area mirrored what was observed in the whole Abrolhos Bank. Knowledge of the consistency with which humpback whales use this important nursing area should prove beneficial for designing future monitoring programmes especially related to whale watching activities around Abrolhos Archipelago."
968,4355,Twenty years’ monitoring of a population of Italian crested newts Triturus carnifex: strong site fidelity and shifting population structure in response to restoration,"Human-induced environmental alterations, e.g. the introduction of alien species and the application of management practices, together with climatic change, represent the main threat to worldwide amphibian conservation. Long-term monitoring programmes are mandatory to monitor the status of amphibian populations in changing landscapes and climatic conditions. In this study, we showed the population dynamic of the Italian crested newts Triturus carnifex living in four artificial ponds in Central Italy over a 20-year period. Adult newts were recognised through a capture-mark-recapture protocol, involving the analysis of belly patterns. The first best population model showed a constant newt survival among years and a complete recapture rate; the second supported model showed a sex-dependent survival, with slightly higher values for males with respect to females, and corroborated a complete recapture rate. A high philopatry occurred: we observed less than 10% of individuals dispersing from a birth site to other ponds. In 20 years of continuous monitoring, the population of Italian crested newt increased. The removal of goldfish Carassius auratus from one of the ponds in 2010 allowed adult newts to overwinter within the pond and to have two reproductive periods, with overwintering larvae after the second spawning."
969,3185,The effect of shelterwood harvesting and site preparation on eastern red-backed salamanders in white pine stands,"We studied the effects of the regeneration cut of the shelterwood system and four site preparation options on populations of; eastern red-backed salamanders in 90100-year-old white pine forests in central Ontario, Canada. We established the study in; 1994 using a randomized complete block design with three replicates and five treatments: (1) no harvest, no site preparation; (2); harvest, no site preparation; (3) harvest, mechanical site preparation; (4) harvest, chemical site preparation; (5) harvest,; mechanical and chemical site preparation. We applied harvest and site preparation treatments from fall 1995 to fall 1997. We; collected pre-treatment data in spring and summer of 1995 and post-treatment data from 1998 to 2002. We monitored; salamander abundance using a grid of 20 cover boards surveyed 10 times per year within each of the 15 treatment plots.We also; quantified changes in overstory and understory cover, supply of downed woody debris, and disturbance to the forest floor. Our; data suggest that shelterwood cutting and site preparation can have immediate negative effects on the abundance of red-backed; salamander populations in pine forest. However, effects are relatively short lived (<5 years). Changes in abundance appeared to; be related to overstory and understory cover, and forest floor disturbance."
970,3742,Population dynamics of Eastern Rockhopper Penguins on Campbell Island in relation to sea surface temperature 1942–2012: current warming hiatus pauses a long-term decline,"Major population changes of marine mega-fauna are ongoing as global warming, and other anthropogenic drivers affect prey availability. The historical stronghold of the Eastern Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome filholi) was New Zealand’s sub-Antarctic Campbell Island, but the population declined by 94 % between 1942 and 1984. The apparent mechanism of collapse was warm ocean temperatures causing an inadequate food supply. Eudyptes penguin population declines are ongoing at some breeding sites, highlighting the need to investigate the population trend on Campbell Island since 1984. We estimated the Eastern Rockhopper Penguin breeding population size through physical and photo-counts of birds and nests in 2012, and changes in colony area relative to 1984 and 1996 photographs. We estimated the 2012 population size at 33,239 breeding pairs, a 21.8 % decrease from an (adjusted) estimate of 42,528 pairs in 1984. Although substantial, the recent 1984–2012 decline occurred at a much slower rate (λ = 0.991) than the 1942–1984 decline (λ = 0.940). Despite great variation in trends between colonies ostensibly linked to differences in predation rates, the recent decline occurred primarily between 1984 and 1996, and thereafter the overall population grew. A 100-year time series of extended reconstructed sea surface temperatures (ERSST) confirmed that the population declined during warm periods and increased during cool periods, but that the initial decline began before increases in regional ERSST. Population growth after 1996 appears related to the current global warming hiatus, lower ERSST, and increased abundance of a key prey species. We predict a continuation of the long-term population decline after warming resumes."
971,3097,"Dramatic declines of semipalmated sandpipers on their major wintering areas in the Guianas, Northern South America","In the 1980s, aerial surveys in South America established that the main wintering areas of Semipalmated; Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) were found on the north coast of the continent, especially in the Guianas; (Suriname, French Guiana and Guyana). Although population trend analyses have consistently shown declines; in numbers of Semipalmated Sandpipers, especially for birds on migration in eastern North America, until now; surveys had not been undertaken to determine whether such declines were reflected in numbers on the main wintering; areas. Between December 2008 and January 2011, aerial surveys of major wintering areas in Suriname (3),; French Guiana (2) and Guyana (1) were carried out. Results showed dramatic declines, with an overall total of only; 21% of the 1980s totala decrease of 79%. A variety of reasons may have contributed to the declines and include; habitat changes, range shifts, sustained hunting, or increases in predation, pollution or severe weather."
972,3364,Demographic analysis of a declining pika Ochotona collaris population: linking survival to broad-scale climate patterns via spring snowmelt patterns,"1. Demographic analysis is essential in order to determine which factors, such as survival, fertility and other life-history characteristics, have the greatest influence on a population's rate of growth (λ). 2. We used life-table response experiments (LTREs) to assess the relative importance of survival and fertility rates for an alpine lagomorph, the collared pika Ochotona collaris, using 12 years (1995-2006) of census data. The LTRE analysis was repeated for each of three subpopulations within the main study site that were defined by aspect (east, west and south). 3. Across the entire study site, the survival and fertility of adults contributed 35.6 and 43.5%, respectively, to the variance observed in the projected population growth rate, V(λ), whereas juvenile survival contributed 20.9%. Adult survival and fertility contributed approximately equal amounts for each subpopulation when considered separately, although their rank order varied spatially. 4. Adult survival across the entire site was positively correlated to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) with a time lag of 1 year, and was uncorrelated to adult density. The PDO was negatively correlated to the timing of spring snowmelt at our site, implicating the importance of earlier spring conditions and plant phenology on the subsequent winter survival of adults and therefore, population growth. 5. When subpopulations were analysed separately, survivals and fertilities were variously correlated to lagged PDO and adult densities, but the patterns varied spatially. Therefore, the mechanisms underlying V(λ) can vary substantially over relatively short distances. "
973,3804,Tarangire revisited: Consequences of declining connectivity in a tropical ungulate population," The hyper-abundance of migratory wildlife in many ecosystems depends on maintaining access to seasonally available resources. In Eastern and Southern Africa, land-use change and a loss of connectivity have coincided with widespread declines in the abundance and geographic range of ungulate populations. Using photographic capture-mark-recapture, we examine the historical pattern of loss of connectivity and its impact on population trends in a partially migratory wildebeest population in northern Tanzania. To estimate abundance, we use a novel modeling approach that overcomes bias associated with photo misidentifications. Our data indicate (1) diminished connectivity within and between seasonal areas as a result of human activities, (2) a reduction in the overall population size compared to historical numbers, with high variability over time, (3) the continued use of highly constrained movement corridors between the three main seasonal ranges, (4) higher recruitment in the non-migratory subpopulation (Lake Manyara National Park) than in other areas of the ecosystem, and (5) an increase in the relative abundance of resident to migrant wildebeest. Recent conservation efforts to protect seasonal habitat and to enforce anti-poaching policies outside protected areas have likely helped stabilize the population, at least temporarily, but we caution that several key vulnerabilities remain."
974,2138,Abundance of yellow-phase American eels in the Hudson River estuary,"Fisheries for American eel Anguilla rostrata occur mostly in estuaries, yet eel abundance in large estuaries is poorly understood and the methods for estimating eel density underdeveloped. During 1997-1999, mark-recapture experiments were conducted for six consecutive days at six sites spanning the 250-km tidal portion of the Hudson River estuary, New York. Each experiment comprised 36 baited eel traps arrayed at 200-m intervals over 144-ha sampling sites. Estimates of local density were complicated by eel behavior, including trap-shy responses to marking and immigration into the experimental grid in response to bait attraction. We compared two open-population models, both modified Peterson methods: Jolly-Seber and a model created to account for eel behavior termed the mean recapture model (MRM). The biases in model outputs in response to trap-shy behavior and immigration were analyzed through simulations; the MRM showed less bias (-13%) than the Jolly-Seber model (+36%). Density estimates for the sampled regions ranged from 2 to 18 eels/ha for MRM and from 3 to 24 eels/ha for the Jolly-Seber model. The lowest density (1.6 eels/ha) was estimated for Albany (river km 240), but all other sites were estimated to have similar densities (5-18 eels/ha). The mean local density in the Hudson River estuary, 9.5 eels/ha, was much lower than those estimated for other systems. An overall abundance of 118,000 was calculated for Hudson River estuary eels larger than 30 cm (total length) at depths of 2-10 m."
975,3692,"Population trends and reproduction of bald eagles at Besnard Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada 1968-2012","The study of population regulation is crucial for understanding population dynamics and for; conservation. We report on trends in population size and reproduction of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus); at Besnard Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, during 19682012. We investigated the relative importance; of density-dependent (population size) and density-independent (climate) factors in explaining variation; in population growth rate and productivity. The number of occupied Bald Eagle territories increased until; ca. 1988, but remained stable afterwards, fluctuating around ca. 26 pairs. The number of successful pairs; increased until only ca. 1977 and remained relatively stable or slightly declined afterwards (ca. 16 successful; breeding pairs per year). We found a strong negative density-dependence in all reproduction parameters; (mean productivity, nesting success, mean brood size at fledging). Annual production initially increased in; the 1970s, but decreased afterwards, while nesting success decreased throughout the whole study period.; We also found a strong density-dependence in population growth rate, indicating that the stabilized; population was regulated. It probably reached its carrying capacity in the late 1970s, although population; size continued to increase until the late 1980s. Mean brood size at fledging was negatively related to the; number of failed nesting pairs. Density alone explained most of the variation in breeding performance,; although milder springs were weakly associated with a higher nesting success. Finally, we found evidence for; regular fluctuations in mean productivity, and particularly in nesting success, with a 5-yr period. We discuss; possible mechanisms behind the observed patterns of density-dependent reproduction and implications for; our knowledge of how this eagle population is regulated."
976,4487,Integrating life-history traits and amphibian upland habitat use in a Neotropical hotspot,"Effective management of semi-aquatic animals requires detailed information on upland habitat use around aquatic habitats. Quantifying the amount of habitats needed to sustain local animals populations is a crucial criterion when setting protective buffers to water bodies, especially for amphibians, which depend on these upland habitats for breeding and development. Differences in upland habitat use can emerge among amphibian species with distinct life-history traits, including reproductive-strategy (pond-breeding vs. non-pond breeding anurans), life-stage (adults vs. juveniles), and sex (males vs. females). To date there has been no quantitative study of upland habitat use in the Neotropics, which can provide a baseline for quantifying the amount of upland forested habitats needed to sustain local amphibian populations. We monitored three ponds for over two sampling year using drift fences with pitfall traps to investigate how reproductive-strategy, life-stage, and sex affect anuran upland habitat use in a forest remnant in the Atlantic Forest hotspot. We found no differences in upland habitat use between adult and juvenile anurans. However, we found that although the species richness of pond-breeding and non-pond breeding anurans was similar near wetlands, there was greater abundance of pond-breeding compared to non-pond breeding anurans. We also found a strong difference between the sexes in pond-breeding anurans, with males remaining closer to wetlands than females. Thus, the sex ratio of amphibian populations can be strongly skewed toward males if only small protective terrestrial buffers (50-m) are enforced during land development. Our findings also point to the inadequacy of current Brazilian policies to protect small wetlands and the fauna that depend on them. We recommend that policymakers adjust regulatory criteria to set hierarchical protective buffers around wetlands allowing different levels of land-use intervention."
977,911,"Aerial surveys of caiman, marsh deer and pampas deer in the Pantanal Wetland of Brazil","The yacare caiman (Caiman c. yacare) was illegally hunted in the Pantanal during the 1970s and 1980s at levels that may have reached one million skins per year. The possibility that yacare caiman had been over-exploited generated pressure for a monitoring programme for caiman populations. The marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) and pampas deer (Ozotocerus bezoarticus) are listed as endangered in Brazil and need the protection of effective management programmes. Ground surveys are difficult for the extensive and inaccessible Pantanal Wetland, south-western Brazil, but aerial surveys provided information that allowed re-evaluation of conservation priorities. Caiman and marsh deer have larger populations than was believed. Preliminary data indicates that the pampas deer density decreased at a rate of about 30% per year from 1991 to 1993. This indicates the need for detailed ground-level studies for the pampas deer population in the Pantanal. We recommend a long term monitoring program using standardized counting procedures for wildlife populations in the Pantanal."
978,759,Habitat preference of Canada lynx through a cycle in snowshoe hare abundance,"We assessed habitat preference of a lynx (Lynx canadensis) population through 8 years of a snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) cycle. Seventy-four percent of our southern Yukon study area was approximately 30-year-old regenerating forest resulting from a large wildfire. The study area was not trapped and lynx density was very high compared with other populations in North America. Contrary to our prediction, there was no discernable shift in habitat preference through the hare cycle; however, our habitat types were coarsely mapped and our radiolocations relatively inaccurate. Lynx may have altered their habitat preferences at finer scales (for patches <2 ha). Lynx showed strong preference for regenerating habitats over mature white spruce (Picea glauca) and alpine-subalpine. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) dominated regenerating stands were preferred over spruce-willow (Salix spp.) stands of equal age. Riparian willow stands were also preferred over mature spruce forest and alpine. Lynx used riparian willow stands more in winter, but we detected no other shifts in habitat preference between snow-free and winter periods. We did not detect any difference in habitat preference between sexes. Independent juveniles made greater use of mature forest and perhaps riparian willow than adults, but no other difference in preference between the two age groups was noted. Lynx preference for regenerating habitat over mature forest suggests that burns will benefit lynx, especially if the regenerating community is pine dominated. Logging will only likely provide similar benefits if a dense pine understory results, which is unlikely in intensively managed stands. The suppression of forest fires in recent decades may have contributed to the decline of lynx numbers in the south of their range."
979,4563,Population traits and colonization success of non-native Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) 35 years after its first appearance in the Mediterranean Lake Skadar,"Abundance, spatial distribution, population structure and growth of non-native Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) were examined in the Lake Skadar, a large, unstratified lake in the Mediterranean region inhabited by several endemic, rare and threatened fish species. Fish were caught in the infra-littoral and littoral habitats of the northern and central parts of the lake using multi-mesh gill nets over three consecutive years. Eurasian perch was among the most dominant species in both habitats. The mean relative abundance is - NPUE (0.556 individuals m−2) and relative biomass is - WPUE (23.56 g m−2) (years and habitats combined). Its population consisted primarily of individuals in first, second and third year of life span (0+ − 2+ age classes). The youngest fish in first and second year showed low mortality rates, older fish in third, fourth, fifth and sixth year of life span (age classes 2+ − 5+) experienced great losses, with mortality rates ranging from 0.6–1.0. The von Bertalanffy growth curve formula, expressing the expected total length Lt = 36.98 (1-e-0.23 (t + 1.018)) with growth performance value Φ’ = 2.50, revealed fast growth-in-length. Length-to-weight relationship was Wt = 6.2 × 10−3Lt         3.27, indicating positive growth-in-weight. It has been concluded that 35 years after the first finding in the Lake Skadar, Eurasian perch adapted well to local conditions in this Mediterranean environment, with the life span changed in favor of fast growth and early maturation."
980,3912,"Biology, fisheries and distribution of Thryssa vitrirostris (Gilchrist & Thompson 1908) and other Engraulidae along the coast of the Sofala Bank, western Indian Ocean","The Sofala Bank (16°-21° S) forms a major discontinuity in the gradients of engraulid distribution along the south-eastern African coast. Although the number of species declines southwards, the density and the catches of species associated with higher turbidity increases within the bank, particularly for Thryssa vitrirostris and a few other Thryssa and Stolephorus species. Thryssa vitrirostris forms a single demographic population on the Sofala Bank, as judged from spatial and seasonal catch-rate data from the beach-seine fishery, the largest fishery in Mozambique. The core of the exploitable population seems to migrate towards the coast at the onset of the rainy season (November-February), and then northwards. Our results indicate that reproduction is timed with the rain regime, and length frequency data show that this is also the onset of a fast (L∞ = 19.0 cm, k = 0.66 y-1) and highly seasonal (C = 0.86) growth. The population is largely comprised of fish up to 2 years of age and the fisheries target mostly pre-spawners (L50 = 13 cm). The decline in standing stocks offshore, and in the catches of this species by beach-seines, may be related to an excessive exploitation rate (40-60%) brought about by the directed fishery and trawl bycatch.

981,2315,"Distribution and abundance of the common ungulates of Nyika National Park, Malawi","Local seasonal movements of the ungulates in Nyika National Park, Malawi, are mainly induced by the prescribed burning policy, habitat preference and weather. The populations of almost all ungulates have increased over the past 14 years except the zebra (Equus burchelli), whose population has stagnated. Eland (Tragelaphus oryx) is the most important contributor to the total biomass of the park's large mammals. Continuation of manipulative burning has been recommended."
982,4491,"Making the most of sparse data to estimate density of a rare and threatened species: a case study with the fosa, a little-studied Malagasy carnivore"," Sparse detections in camera trap surveys commonly hinder density estimation for threatened species. By combining detections across multiple surveys, or using informative priors in Bayesian model fitting, researchers can improve parameter estimation from sparse capturerecapture data. Using a spatial markresight model that incorporates site-level heterogeneity in the spatial scale parameter via a hierarchical process and prior information, we estimated the density of a threatened carnivore (fosa, Cryptoprocta ferox) from multiple sparse datasets collected during extensive camera trapping surveys in northeastern Madagascar (20082015). Our objectives were to estimate density for six sites, examine the response of fosa density and movement to habitat degradation, monitor annual density trends across 7 years at two sites, and estimate fosa abundance in the MakiraMasoala protected area complex. We obtained a mean of 16.1 (se = 0.52; range = 249) fosa detections and three observers identified a mean of 3.62 (se = 0.09; range = 18) marked individuals per survey. Fosa daily baseline encounter rate was very low (?0 = 0.004; 0.0030.006) and density/movement estimates were similar across forest types. Density estimates at resurveyed sites suggested annual variability in density, with estimates trending lower during the final surveys [e.g. D = 0.39 (0.141.11) versus 0.08 (0.050.31) individuals per km2]. We estimated fosa abundance across the MakiraMasoala region to be 1061 (95% HPDI: 5961780) adult individuals. On the basis of our estimate and the size of the region, we believe MakiraMasoala harbors a significant portion of the global fosa population. The conservation and management of rare species is commonly limited due to lack of population estimates. By combining detections across surveys, we overcame estimation issues and obtained valuable information on a threatened carnivore, allowing us to better assess its status and prioritize conservation actions. We advocate for practical use of sparse datasets for such data-deficient species."
983,4507,Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park: the first comprehensive elasmobranch assessment reveals global hotspot for reef sharks,"                             Elasmobranchs are experiencing population declines worldwide because of anthropogenic stressors. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been shown to benefit mesopredatory species of shark. The Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (TRNP) is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site and the largest no-take MPA in the Philippines, yet information on the current status of elasmobranchs in the park is limited. Here, we investigate the abundance and biodiversity of elasmobranchs in TRNP using underwater visual census (UVC) and baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys. Twenty UVC were conducted in May 2015 (n = 10) and June 2016 (n = 10), documenting eight species of elasmobranchs with an average density of 7.18 sharks ha                             -1                              for both years. A total of 113 successful BRUV surveys were conducted in TRNP between March–June 2015 (n = 47) and April–June 2016 (n = 66). The BRUV surveys recorded 14 species with an average catch per unit effort of 2.09 elasmobranchs per hour for both years. Both survey methods report some of the highest densities of the grey reef shark Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and the whitetip reef shark Triaenodon obesus documented worldwide. This study underlines the importance of large, well-managed MPAs such as TRNP for the conservation of reef-associated elasmobranchs.                         "
984,1356,Second-order feedback and climatic effects determine the dynamics of a small rodent population in a temperate forest of South America,"The multiannual cyclic fluctuations exhibited by arvicoline rodents in the Northern Hemisphere have attracted the attention of population ecologists. However, despite the abundant information on small rodent dynamics in South America, there are no studies reporting cyclic population dynamics. Here, we report evidence of cyclic population dynamics in a South American small rodent, the longhaired field mouse (Abrothrix longipilis) from southern temperate forests in Chile. The time-series analyses showed that longhaired field mice dynamics are better represented by a second-order autoregressive model characterized by 3-year cyclic dynamics. The 3-year cycles are clearly shown in the autocorrelation factor (ACF) pattern and in the dominant frequency of the spectral analysis. In addition, we determined nonlinear effects of the Antarctic Oscillation Index (AAOI). The results shown here pointed out that we need the integration of studies about cyclic small rodent populations from the different continents and beyond the Northern Hemisphere to resolve the enigma underlying the cyclic population dynamics exhibited by many small rodent species."
985,1393,Wolf depredation trends and the use of fladry barriers to protect livestock in western North America,"In Alberta, Canada (1982-2001), and in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, United States (1987-2001), wolves (Canis lupus) killed various domestic animals, among which the major prey were sheep in the United States (68%, n = 494) and cattle in Canada (95%; n = 1633). Under recovery programs, the wolf population increased in the United States, and depredation events increased proportionately. In both countries, the number of domestic animals killed each year was correlated with the number of wolves killed by government authorities for depredation management. We tested the ability of antiwolf barriers made of flags hanging from ropes to impede wolf access to food and livestock. In 18 experiments, barriers prevented captive wolves (n = 9) from accessing food for up to 28 hours and allowed daily separation of wolves to administer contraceptive pills to a female wolf. Barriers prevented access by wild wolves to 100-m2 baited sites during two 60-day tests. We also set barriers around three cattle pastures. In Alberta during two 60-day trials on 25-ha pastures, wolves approached barriers on 23 occasions but did not cross them, and no cattle were killed. Wolves killed cattle on neighboring ranches during the trials and before and after the trials on the tested ranches. In Idaho four radiocollared wolves crossed barriers and killed cattle in a 400-ha ranch after 61 days of barrier exposure. Our results suggest that antiwolf barriers are effective in deterring captive and wild wolves for > 1 and ≥ 60 days, respectively, and that wild wolves switch to alternative livestock when excluded from one herd of livestock. Our depredation data indicate that protecting livestock from wolves reduces the necessity for killing wolves. Barriers could play a role among the limited set of preventive measures available and offer a cost-effective mitigation tool for the problem of livestock depredation on a local scale."
986,4606,Status of Fisheries Resource and Management Approach in the Open Beels of Bangladesh: A Comparative Case Study,"A fish catch monitoring program was introduced in Ashura beel, Goakhola beel and Dikshi beel in 1997 through the Community Based Fisheries Management (CBFM) project. The project focused on developing community management approaches which would encourage participation of the fishers, beneficiaries and community in sustainable management of the fishery resources. The present study conducted in all three open beels indicated that the 2002 annual fish production increased by 359 and 222% compared to the base line survey in 1997 in Goakhola and Dikshi beels, respectively, but only 53% in Ashura beel. The catch per person per day increased by 50 and 123% in Goakhola and Dikshi, respectively, but decreased by 40.5% in Ashura beel as compared to the base line catch in 1997. Species diversity was higher in Ashura and Dikshi beels in 2002 than in 1997; however, Goakhola beel was more diverse in 1997. Estimated MSY for Ashura, Goakhola and Dikshi was 48.0, 23.0 and 78.0 tons, and corresponding fishing effort 16452, 7812 and 19984 gear daysxyear-1, respectively. Analysis of effort data indicated that maximum fishing pressure has been reached or exceeded for all three floodplain beels and any further increase in catch effort should be restricted.   "
987,1602,Habitat Characteristics of the Endangered Hoolock Gibbons of Bangladesh: The Role of Plant Species Richness,"Hoolock gibbons (Hoolock hoolock) are endangered small apes occurring in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and south China. All known populations have undergone declines primarily due to habitat destruction or alteration. We examined the influence of area of natural forests, area of plantations, area of agricultural land and edible plant species richness on the hoolock gibbon numbers from 22 sites in Bangladesh using multiple regression analysis. Area of natural forests and plantations were not linked to hoolock gibbon numbers, whereas area of agricultural land and edible plant species richness were both significantly linked. Higher edible plant species richness was directly related to hoolock gibbon numbers, while the area of agricultural land was inversely related. This is the first quantitative study illustrating the importance of these two variables with hoolock gibbon numbers. We also analyzed the existing habitat characteristics in two of the largest hoolock gibbon populations in Bangladesh: Lawachara (42 individuals) and Kaptai (84 individuals). Trees in Lawachara were generally smaller compared to those in Kaptai. Artocarpus, Tectona, and Dipterocarpus were the three most important genera in both sites, although Artocarpus was more important in Lawachara. Each site also had an abundant variety of tree species utilized by hoolock gibbons for food. We discuss the current context of primate conservation in Bangladesh and suggest that the current conservation priority for gibbons in the country should be protection and improvement of habitat. "
988,1416,Cascading Effects of the Loss of Apex Predatory Sharks from a Coastal Ocean,"Impacts of chronic overfishing are evident in population depletions worldwide, yet indirect ecosystem effects induced by predator removal from oceanic food webs remain unpredictable. As abundances of all 11 great sharks that consume other elasmobranchs (rays, skates, and small sharks) fell over the past 35 years, 12 of 14 of these prey species increased in coastal northwest Atlantic ecosystems. Effects of this community restructuring have cascaded downward from the cownose ray, whose enhanced predation on its bay scallop prey was sufficient to terminate a century-long scallop fishery. Analogous top-down effects may be a predictable consequence of eliminating entire functional groups of predators."
989,2767,Monitoring population size of red deer Cervus elaphus: an evaluation of two types of census data from Norway,"Proper management of wildlife relies on metrics of population development. Typically, the best estimation techniques are too expensive for coarse-scale management. In marine fisheries, catch-per-unit effort is, commonly used, but problems may arise due to changes in spatial harvest effort or in habitat use as density changes. Managers in Norway are in the early phases of implementing 'seen deer' during harvesting and 'spring counts' on farmland as a means of monitoring red deer Cervus elaphus populations. We provide a first evaluation of how suitable these methods are by comparing the results with population estimates obtained using cohort analysis, and by analysing the within-season variation in number of seen deer. 'Seen deer' predicted annual increases in populations fairly well. Adjusting for harvesting effort provided less good estimates, due to a proportionally larger increase in effort relative to deer population size as population size increased. The number of seen deer per day decreased rapidly at the beginning of the season, and then levelled off or increased slightly during the rut, especially on farmland. The number of seen deer increased both with the number of harvesters and hours harvested, but at a diminishing rate. The current practice of 'spring counts' was not successful in predicting population changes, probably due to a lack of replication. Indeed, date strongly affected the number of deer seen during spring counts. While 'seen deer' seems to be a very promising tool for monitoring population size of red deer, there are some limitations to the practice as implemented for moose Alces alces in Scandinavia due to a more complex relationship with harvesting effort. Our study highlights that the large number of hours harvesters observe wildlife can provide a useful tool for population monitoring. However, the use of such indices may vary between species and according to harvest techniques and should thus be assessed with care before implementation."
990,1784,"A preliminary study of two sympatric Maxomys rats in Sarawak, Malaysia: spacing patterns and population dynamics","An ecological study focusing on the spacing patterns and population dynamics of two sympatric rats, Maxomys rajah and M. whiteheadi, was conducted using wire-mesh live cage traps over eight years in a primary tropical rain forest in Sarawak, Malaysia. Home range size, observed range length, the distribution of home ranges, and fluctuations in abundance of the two species were quantified. No significant differences were found in home range size or observed range lengths between conspecific sexes or between species. Overlaps of home range were mostly detected between heterospecific individuals, but occasionally between conspecific individuals. Populations of both rats fluctuated widely throughout the study period. The similar-sized home ranges of sexes within species and the significantly broad, overlapping home ranges between species respectively suggest a monogamous mating system in Maxomys and a mechanism, facilitating interspecific coexistence. Natural disturbances such as severe drought or changes in food availability (like mass fruiting) may influence the population dynamics of these rats. "
991,3011,"Contrasting effects of marine protected areas on the abundance of two exploited reef fishes at the subtropical Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia.","A unique assemblage of tropical and temperate marine organisms characterizes the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, four clusters of islands and reefs off the coast of mid-Western Australia. Four reef observation areas or marine protected areas (MPAs)were established in 1994 to examine their value in protecting vulnerable reef fish species, including the sub-tropical wrasse, Choerodon rubescens, and the coral trout, Plectropomus leopardus. In 1993 and 1994 (prior to protection), population densities and body sizes were monitored at two island groups (Easter and Wallabi). At each location, the MPAs and the equivalent control areas to remain open to fishing were monitored by underwater visual censuses. These closed and open areas were subsequently monitored four more times between 1995 and 2002 to assess longterm trends in abundance and population structure. Populations of thewrasse, C. rubescens,did not appear to respond to protection, exhibiting irregular fluctuations in both closed and open areas throughout the study. In contrast, although there were no significant increases for P. leopardus for the first three years of closure, after eight years of protection there were significantly larger numbers of P. leopardus in the closed areas. There was a three-fold increase at the Easter Group and a seven-fold increase at the Wallabi Group, relative to open fishing areas, attributed primarily to reduced fishing mortality. Significant closed areas (17% of the P. leopardus habitat) provided substantial stock-wide impacts. The data also indicate that the MPAs can be effective where some forms of fishing (such as lobster fishing) are permitted which are compatible with the objectives of theMPA. While MPAs are clearly an effective tool for increasing the local abundance of some reef fishes, the spatial and temporal scales required for their successmay vary among species."
992,2132,Changes in the fish populations in Danube delta lakes: effects of hydrology and water quality change. Review of results and potential for rehabilitation.,"Long term fish catch statistics indicate that the commercial catch in the Danube delta (Romania) has declined about three-fold in the last half of 20th century. The fish community changed dramatically due to habitat loss, hydromorphological changes and pollution (nutrients, microcontaminants). To reverse this anthropogenic impact, several ecological reconstruction projects (polder re-opening, blocking man-made canals) have been completed. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the feasibility of damage reversal: 1) Fish have recolonised an ecologically rehabilitated 2100 ha polder rapidly (1-5 years) through openings in the embankments and re-flooding in 1994. The rebuilt habitats and the fish communities however, reflect the general eutrophic character of lakes elsewhere in the delta. 2) The direct hydrological connectivity from the river to a complex of lakes, which was blocked to mitigate siltation, showed an immediate shift from rheophilic/eurytopic to eurytopic/limnophilic species in just one season (2001 vs 2002). The biomass decreased dramatically in the lakes that were closest to the river. We conclude that ecological reconstruction from a terrestrial polder to lacustrine habitats is simple to achieve through re-establishment of hydrological connectivity, but restoration pristine fish communities depends upon recreating former hydrological patterns and water quality that are more difficult to achieve."
993,1769,"Pragmatic management increases a flagship species, the Himalayan brown bears, in Pakistan’s Deosai National Park","Deosai Plateau in Northern Pakistan was designated a national park to protect the largest remnant population of brown bears in Pakistan. The natural resources of this high elevation (3500-5000 m) park make a significant contribution to the livelihood of local and nomad communities. The present legislation excludes people from a park, which increases conflicts between management and local people. However, a pragmatic approach was adopted to involve people in conservation in Deosai. Community participation, achieved by recognizing rights and introducing incentives, reduced resistance against the conservation efforts, reduced grazing pressure in bear habitat and helped reduce poaching. The size of the brown bear population was set as an indicator of park success, and was monitored annually from 1993 through 2006. We observed a 5% annual growth of the brown bear population, suggesting that the conservation program has been successful due to a successful cooperation between an NGO, people, and the park management. The increase of the bear population is significant, because we observed an extremely low reproductive rate, due to late age of first reproduction (8.25 years), a long reproductive interval (5.7 years), and a small litter size (1.33). The reproductive rate of the Deosai population is the lowest yet documented for brown bear populations. Poor habitat quality, low quality food, high seasonality, and extreme weather conditions in the Himalaya probably explain the poor reproductive performance. Considering such low reproduction and known exchange of individuals with neighboring populations, we believe that the observed growth was a sum of reproduction and immigration. Brown bears are declining throughout South Asia and often have low-productive rates. Therefore, conservation efforts for brown bears in this region must target reducing human-caused mortalities, particularly of adult females. Involvement of people can increase efficiency in conservation, in addition to reducing cost and conflicts. "
994,1709,Long-term trends of shorebird populations in eastern Australia and impacts of freshwater extraction.,"Shorebirds (Charadriiformes) and their wetland habitats are under threat worldwide. While data exist for shorebird population trends for many parts of the world, two thirds of Australia's populations have not been assessed. We report the results of a large-scale aerial shorebird survey, sampling about a third of the Australian continent over a period of 24 years (1983-2006). Migratory shorebirds have declined by 73%, Australian resident shorebirds by 81%. Of the 10 wetlands supporting the highest number of shorebirds within the survey bands, eight were inland wetlands and only two coastal, emphasising the importance of inland wetlands for shorebirds. Wetland area decreased significantly at four of the 10 main sites. Annual rainfall showed no trends (1983-2005) but water extraction was substantial for four of the 10 wetlands, contributing to reduced flooding extent and frequency. Loss of wetlands due to river regulation is a significant contributor to the drastic decline in shorebird numbers in Australia, largely unrecognized in international conservation agreements in Australia.

995,3920,Use of camera-trapping to estimate puma density and influencing factors in central Brazil,"We used remotely triggered cameras to collect data on Puma (Puma concolor) abundance and occupancy in an area of tropical forest in Brazil where the species status is poorly known. To evaluate factors influencing puma occupancy we used data from 5 sampling campaigns in 3 consecutive years (2005 to 2007) and 2 seasons (wet and dry), at a state park and a private forest reserve. We estimated puma numbers and density for the 2007 sampling data by developing a standardized individual identification method. We based individual identification on 1) time-stable parameters (SP; physical features that do not change over time), and 2) time-variable parameters (VP; marks that could change over time such as scars and botfly marks). Following individual identification we established a capturerecapture history and analyzed it using closed population capturemarkrecapture models. Puma capture probability was influenced by camera placement (roads vs. trails), sampling year, and prey richness. Puma occupancy was positively associated with species richness and there was a correlation between relative puma and jaguar (Panthera onca) abundance. Identifications enabled us to generate 8 VP histories for each photographed flank, corresponding to 8 individuals. We estimated the sampled population at 9 pumas (SE 5 1.03, 95% CI 5 810 individuals) translating to a density of 3.40 pumas/100 km2. Information collected using camera-traps can effectively be used to assess puma population size in tropical forests. As habitat progressively disappears and South American felines become more vulnerable, our results support the critical importance of private forest reserves for conservation."

997,912,Population trends of albatrosses and petrels at sub-Antarctic Marion Island,"We report on the population changes of five species of Procellariiform seabirds breeding at Marion Island: wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans), grey-headed albatross (Thalassarche chrysostoma), northern giant petrel (Macronectes halli), southern giant petrel (M. giganteus), and white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctalis). The four large surface-nesting species (wandering albatross, grey-headed albatross and the northern and southern giant petrel) show similar population trends over the last 16-18 years. All were stable or decreasing during the 1980s, followed by a recovery period during the early to mid-1990s. Recently, all species have once again stabilized or decreased in numbers. Population trends of wandering albatross at Marion Island were strongly correlated with other Indian Ocean populations, but were different from the Atlantic Ocean population. These similarities suggest a common cause and can be explained by changes in tuna (Thunnus spp.) longline fishing effort in the southern Indian Ocean. A recent increase in tuna longlining, as well as recent large-scale Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) longline fishing for Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) close to Marion Island, could be contributing to the recent decreases in some of these species. Adoption of mitigation measures and an effective means of dealing with IUU longline fishing seem necessary to reduce the potential impacts of longline fishing on populations of albatross and petrel."
998,3523,Population characteristics of a recovering US Virgin Islands red hind spawning aggregation following protection,"Many species of groupers form spawning aggregations, dramatic events where 100s to 1000s of individuals gather annually at specific locations for reproduction. Spawning aggregations are often targeted by local fishermen, making them extremely vulnerable to over fishing. The Red Hind Bank Marine Conservation District located in St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, was closed seasonally in 1990 and closed permanently in 1999 to protect an important red hind Epinephelus guttatus spawning site. This study provides some of the first information on the population response of a spawning aggregation located within a marine protected area. Tag-and-release fishing and fish transects were used to evaluate population characteristics and habitat utilization patterns of a red hind spawning aggregation between 1999 and 2004. Compared with studies conducted before the permanent closure, the average size of red hind increased mostly during the seasonal closure period (10 cm over 12 yr), but the maximum total length of male red hind increased by nearly 7 cm following permanent closure. Average density and biomass of spawning red hind increased by over 60 % following permanent closure whereas maximum spawning density more than doubled. Information from tag returns indicated that red hind departed the protected area following spawning and migrated 6 to 33 km to a ca. 500 km2 area. Protection of the spawning aggregation site may have also contributed to an overall increase in the size of red hind caught in the commercial fishery, thus increasing the value of the grouper fishery for local fishermen.

999,2838,Recent trends in the abundance and distribution of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) in British Columbia,"A total of 4,712 sea otters was counted in British Columbia in 2008 (4,110 on west coast Vancouver Island and 602 on the central B.C. coast) up from 3,185 in 2004. The central B.C. coast was also surveyed in 2007 and 642 sea otters were counted. Along Vancouver Island the population increased at a rate of 15.0% year-1 from 1977 to 2008. However, it is evident that growth was more rapid up to 1995 (1977 to 1995, 19.0% year-1 ) and slowed substantially thereafter to 8.4% year-1 . On the central B.C. coast the population increased at a rate 11.4% year-1 from 1990 and 2008. Range expansion continues to contribute to population growth. On the central B.C. coast, range expansion was evident to the southeast and to the north, notably Aristizabal Island. On Vancouver Island expansion into inlet habitat in Esperanza Inlet occurred in 2008."
1000,900,"Evaluating population persistence of censused and unmanaged herbivore populations from the Kruger National Park, South Africa","The application of the Dennis et al. (Ecol. Monogr., 61, 1991) model to data from 12 herbivore populations from the Kruger National Park, South Africa, introduces 'risk assessment' procedures into the conservation management of free-ranging species. The model enables one to predict the probability of reaching an arbitrarily defined threshold population size using census figures from censused and unmanaged populations. It also provides an objective evaluation of population persistence based on past performance. Of the 12 species investigated, five (impala Aepyceros melampus, blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, zebra Equus burchelli, white rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum, giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis) appear to be secure, four (kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros, waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus, warthog Phacochoerus aethiopicus, sable antelope Hippotragus niger) are vulnerable and three species (tsessebe Damaliscus lunatus, eland Taurotragus oryx, roan antelope Hippotragus equinus) are at risk of declining by an order of magnitude within 100 years. Therefore, within data limitations, the KNP appears not to offer sufficient suitable habitat for a number of herbivore species despite its considerable size, and a metapopulation approach may be required for the effective conservation of some species. The model also allows the principle of 'complementarity' to be extended beyond that of species composition. Objective evaluations of population persistence, of censused and unmanaged populations, as demonstrated here, mean that the principle of 'population viability' can help the design of efficient regional reserve networks.

1001,2094,"Spatial and temporal distribution of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) in Cape Cod Bay, and implications for management","Cape Cod Bay (Massachusetts) is the only known winter and early spring feeding area for concentrations of the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) population. During January-May, 1998-2002, 167 aerial surveys were conducted (66,466 km of total survey effort), providing a complete representation of the spatiotemporal distribution of right whales in the bay during winter and spring. A total of 1553 right whales were sighted; some of these sightings were multiple sightings of the same individuals. Right whale distribution and relative abundance patterns were quantified as sightings per unit of effort (SPUE) and partitioned into 103 23-km2 cells and 12 2-week periods. Significant interannual variations in mean SPUE and timing of SPUE maxima were likely due to physically forced changes in available food resources. The area of greatest SPUE expanded and contracted during the season but its center remained in the eastern bay. Most cells with SPUE>0 were inside the federal critical habitat (CH) and this finding gave evidence of the need for management measures within CH boundaries to reduce anthropogenic mortality from vessel strikes and entanglement. There was significant within-season SPUE variability: low in December-January, increasing to a maximum in late February-early April, and declining to zero in May; and these results provide support for management measures from 1 January-15 May."
1002,3134,"Forty years of midwinter counts of waterfowl along the coasts of Scania, south Sweden, 1964–2003","The International Midwinter Counts, organised by Wetlands International, started in January 1967, but co-ordinated counts were organised along the coasts of Scania, south Sweden, already since January 1964. This paper summarises the results of the first forty years. During the first years full coverage was attained, but in later years the counts covered nine larger areas, containing about 75% of all waterfowl. Of the more common species, ten showed significantly increasing, four significantly decreasing, and two species no clear trend. National midwinter indices are available for 11 species; in 10 of these the regional trends are similar to the national trends, Scania forming an important part of the national sample. Several of the changes are related to the hardness of the winters, the milder winters making it possible for more waterfowl to winter in Sweden now compared to earlier years. The decreasing trend for Aythya fuligula in Scania is an example of such changes in winter distribution within the country, more individuals now staying in the Baltic archipelagos than earlier."

After the first exploratory years including; country-wide surveys in 19711973 undertaken both; from the ground, the air and boats, the programme was; standardized to cover an adequate sample of coastal and; inland sites of south Sweden for the production of annual; midwinter population indices for important species; (areas further north in Sweden are normally ice-covered; and without importance for waterbirds in winter). Further; large scale surveys were undertaken in 19871989, 1993; and 2004 (country-wide survey). The programme did not; cover the seaducks in offshore areas (later included in a; special programme).

1004,3286,Distribution and numbers of wintering sea ducks in Swedish offshore waters,"The first survey of seaducks covering the offshore waters of the entire Baltic was undertaken in 1992/1993, when, however, the Swedish waters were covered with relatively few ship surveys. The second all Baltic survey 2007-2011 included extensive aerial surveys of all Swedish offshore waters. This paper presents the Swedish data from these two surveys, supplemented with data from several other but partial surveys back to the early 1970s. The most numerous wintering seaduck in the Swedish waters was the Longtailed Duck Clangula hyemalis with an estimated population of 1.41 million in 1992/1993, decreasing with 69% to 0.44 million in 2007-2009. Hoburg bank south of Gotland and the two Midsjö banks accounted for the vast majority of these ducks. In 2009-2011 only small numbers of scoters Melanitta fusca and M. nigra were found in Swedish Baltic waters. The totals for the Eider Somateria molissima and Red-breasted Merganser Mergus serrator were estimated at 20 000 and 8000, respectively. Larger numbers of Eiders (50 000) and scoters (20 000) were found on the west coast."
1005,3910,Spatial and temporal variation in artisanal catches of dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus off north-eastern Brazil,"The sampling of fish from the artisanal fleet operating with surface lines off north-eastern Brazil was carried out between 1998 and 2000. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to standardize mean abundance indices using catch and fishing effort data on dolphinfish Coryphaena hippurus and to identify abundance trends in time and space, using 1215 surface line deployments. A standard relative abundance index (catch per unit effort, CPUE) was estimated for the most frequent vessels used in the sets, employing factors and coefficients generated in the GLMs. According to the models, C.hippuruscatchesareaffectedbytheoperatingcharacteristicsandpowerofdifferentfishingvessels. These differences highlight the need for standardization of catch and effort data for artisanal fisheries. The highest mean abundance values for C. hippurus were off the state of Rio Grande do Norte, with anincreasingtendencyinareaswithgreaterdepthsandmoredistantfromthecoast,reachingmaximal values in areas whose depths range from 200 to 500m. The highest mean abundance values occurred between April and June. The higher estimated abundance of C. hippurus in this period off the state of Rio Grande do Norte and within the 200500m depth range may be related to a migration pattern of food sources, as its main prey, the flying fish Hirundichthys affinis, uses floating algae as refuge and to deposit its pelagic eggs.

1006,3717,Persistence and variation on the groundfish assemblages on the Southern Grand Banks (NAFO Divisions 3NO): 2002–2011,"Data from EU-Spain (Instituto Español de Oceanografía) bottom trawl surveys in the NAFO Regulatory Area (20022011) were analyzed to examine patterns on the South of Grand Banks (NAFO Div. 3NO) of groundfish assemblage structure and diversity in relation to depth. The 1160 hauls from the slope surveys spanned between 38 and 1460 m in depth. We focused on the 28 most abundant species, which made up 92.6% of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth. For the most part, changes in assemblages seem to be fairly continuous, although there were more abrupt changes at 300 m. Five assemblages were identified. Two shallow assemblages were found in the shelf. Assemblage I (Shallow) comprises the strata with depths lesser than 150 and include yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), Northern sand lance (Ammodytes dubius), moustache sculpin (Triglops murrayi), capelin (Mallotus villosus) and web sculpin (Hemitripterus americanus). Assemblage II (Shallow) includes the strata with depths between 151 and 300 m and comprises Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), American angler (Lophius americanus), wolfish (Anarichas lupus) and thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). Assemblage III (Intermediate) contains the depth strata between 301 and 600 m. Redfish (Sebastes spp.), spotted wolfish (Anarichas minor), Arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulatus), Northern wolfish (Anarichas denticulatus), white hake (Urophycis tenuis), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and longfin hake (Phycis chesteri) were included in the intermediate assemblage. Finally, we found two deep clusters: Assemblage IV (Deep) contains the depths between 601 and 1000 m, and Assemblage V (Deep) the depth strata greater than 1001 m. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), marlin-spike (Nezumia bairdii), roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) and spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) formed Assemblage IV. Snubnosed spiny eel (Notacanthus chemnitzii), blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), Northern cutthroat eel (Syphanobranchus kaupii), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), Arctic skate (Amblyraja hyperborea) and longnose chimera (Harriotta raleighana) made up the deepest assemblage. Despite dramatic changes in biomass and abundance of the species in the area, the boundaries and composition of the assemblages seem to be similar to the period before the collapse. Although some changes were evident, the main ones were replacements of the dominant species in several assemblages and bathymetric range extension of distribution of some species. Yellowtail flounder appears to be the dominant species in the shallowest assemblage instead of Atlantic cod and American plaice that were dominant in the period before the collapse in the area; redfish is the dominant species in the second shallow and intermediate assemblages. Diversity appears inversely related to biomass in the different assemblages. Despite the fishing effort in the deep waters of the Grand Banks, the overall pattern of demersal fish assemblages remains similar over time. This pattern is similar in other Atlantic areas; it indicates that changes in the fish populations in Northwest Atlantic have been produced on a large scale and are not limited to specific areas."
1007,1257,Development and viability of a translocated Beaver Castor fiber population in the Netherlands,"We monitored survival, reproduction and emigration of a translocated beaver Castor fiber population in the Netherlands for five years and used a stochastic model to assess its viability. Between 1988 and 1991, 42 beavers were released in the Biesbosch National Park. The mortality was initially high but gradually fell to normal rates. However, the breeding success was low, and we hypothesized that this was either a temporary phenomenon (the translocation hypothesis) or a permanent feature (the poor habitat hypothesis). According to the computer simulations, the isolated population was viable under the first but not under the second hypothesis. In the latter case, the prospects generally improved by the foundation of another population in the Gelder se Poort (100 km from the Biesbosch). However, this second habitat should be optimal for beavers in order to reduce the extinction probability of the Biesbosch population to below 10% in 100 years; the loss of genetic variability (1-2% per generation) was just above the applied tolerable risk (1%), but the effects of inbreeding are unknown in beavers. We conclude that the beaver population in the Biesbosch is not viable unless the reproductive success increases, either in the Biesbosch itself or in a nearby population. We recommend applying such viability analyses to evaluate the likely success of any translocation."
1008,3385,The perils of plasticity: dual resource pulses increase facilitation but destabilize populations of small-bodied cavity-nesters,"Resource pulses within structured communities can lead to changes in the ecological roles of community members, particularly for species that exhibit plasticity in resource use. The red-breasted nuthatch Sitta canadensis is a facultative excavating cavity-nester that forages on seeds and insects, thus exhibits plasticity in both nesting habits and diet. In a long-term study of cavity-nesting vertebrates, we used point counts, and nest and vegetation surveys to examine the effects of two resource pulses of mountain pine bark beetle prey Dendroctonus ponderosae and tree cavities via excavator populations, on population densities and cavity reuse of red-breasted nuthatches, from 1997-2006. We observed a doubling in mean nut-hatch densities from 0.12 to 0.24 individuals ha-1 then a collapse later in the decade to 50% below endemic levels (0.06 individuals ha-1). These regional fluctuations were positively correlated with densities of trees recently infected by bark beetles. Because nuthatches range over large areas in winter, this regional correlation suggests that populations responded to the increase in winter food supply. At the site scale, general linear mixed effects models showed that nuthatch populations increased following years of high densities of downy woodpeckers Picoides pubescens, suggesting that downy woodpeckers were important facilitators, via cavity excavation. Type of nesting cavity used by nuthatches varied during the pulse, such that the use of existing cavities (in lieu of excavation) increased on sites that had harboured downy woodpecker nests in the previous year. We conclude that increased densities of cavity excavators allowed facultative excavators to increase their reuse of cavities, which may have contributed to the dramatic increases in nuthatch populations. However, nuthatch populations collapsed after the boom suggesting that this dual resource pulse may have destabilized populations by enabling densities to reach unsustainable levels. Thus, plasticity in resource use can have serious costs as well as benefits. "
1009,988,"Changes in the vegetation and reptile populations on Round Island, Mauritius, following eradication of rabbits","Changes in the vegetation and reptile populations on Round Island, Mauritius are described using the results of expeditions in 1982 (when rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus were abundant) and 1989 (three years after their eradication). Changes in vegetation cover and composition are described, all directly or indirectly attributable to the eradication of rabbits. These changes include marked increases in the regeneration of three tree species (all endemic, or largely restricted, to Round Island) and plant species formerly grazed by rabbits. The increasing impact of plant species accidentally introduced to the island is documented. Recent increases in the populations of several endemic reptile species (five of which are threatened) are also described; these can be attributed to increases in habitat and food availability following the eradication of rabbits. In the light of these observations, projected changes are discussed and recommendations made for management. "
1010,4149,The Devil We Don't Know: Investigating Habitat and Abundance of Endangered Giant Devil Rays in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea,"The giant devil ray Mobula mobular, the only Mediterranean mobulid, is subject to mortality caused by directed and accidental captures in fisheries throughout the region. Whilst the combination of human impacts, limited range and a low reproductive potential is not inconsistent with its endangered listing, there are insufficient data to enable a quantitative assessment of trends. Without this, it is difficult to assess and prioritise threats and develop effective conservation actions. Using results from aerial surveys conducted between 2009 and 2014 over the Ligurian, Corsican, Sardinian, northern and central Tyrrhenian seas (626,228 km2), this study provides the first quantitative information on giant devil ray abundance and habitat choice in the western Mediterranean. Devil rays were observed in all seasons except winter, with their estimated abundance in the study area peaking in summer. The overall uncorrected mean density in the study area during summer was estimated at 0.0257 individuals km-2 (range: 0.0170.044), resulting in a total abundance estimate of 6,092 (12.7%CV) individuals at the surface; once corrected for availability bias, this estimate indicates a summer presence of >12,700 devil rays in the study area. Rays were mostly observed alone even if occasionally, larger aggregations up to a maximum of 18 individuals were observed. Although observed throughout the study area, spatial modelling identified their preferred habitat to be over a broad strip connecting the Tuscan Archipelago to Eastern Sardinia, over a wide range of water depths ranging from 10 to 2000m. The observed seasonal changes in giant devil ray distribution in this study, combined with similar evidence from other areas in the Mediterranean, support the hypothesis that the species undertakes latitudinal migrations across the region, taking advantage of highly productive waters in the north during summer, and warmer southern waters during winter."
1011,2510,"Density and demography of wolf, Canis lupus population in the western-most part of the Polish Carpathian Mountains, 1996-2003","In Central Europe. where most wolf populations persist in habitats altered by humans. the dynamics of these populations are significantly influenced by human activities. Our studies in the western-most part of the Polish Carpathian Mts, 1996-2003. revealed that the winter density of wolves varied in the region from 1.3-1.9 wolves/100 km2 (on average 1.6. SE=0.13). In late summer, the average number of wolves in a pack was 4.7 wolves (n=21, range 2-9. SE=0.4). while an average pack in winter consisted of 4.0 wolves (n=25, range 2-7. SE=0.3). The mean wolf territory covered an area of 158 km2 (SE=26.7, range 98-227 km2). In the Silesian Beskid Mountains. where no human hunting pressure occurred. the wolf population increased during the study period at a mean rate of 28% per year. However, in the Zywiecki Beskid Mountains. where wolves were subject to hunting management in the Slovakian parts of their territories. the population did not increase. The mean rate of increase of the wolf population in the entire study area was 8% per year. Wolf mating seasons began oil February 13th and lasted until March 71, with pups being born during the first ten days of May. Pup rearing places were located between 880 and 1290 m a.s.l. (average = 1009 m a.s.l.. SE=34.5. n=11), in dense thickets or under roots of fallen trees and stumps. We did not find excavated dens. In late slimmer. we recorded an average of 1.9 pups per pack. but counted only 1.3 pups per pack the following winter. Reasons for death (n=18) included culls (83%). collisions with motor vehicles (11%). and sarcoptic mange (6%). In the Zywiecki Beskid Mountains we estimated the minimum mortality rate of 1.5 individuals/pack/year."
1012,4233,Distribution and abundance of skates (Bathyraja spp.) on the Kerguelen Plateau through the lens of the toothfish fisheries,"Three species of skate, Bathyraja eatonii, B. irrasa and B. murrayi, are commonly taken as incidental by-catch in Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) longline and trawl fisheries, and the mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) trawl fishery on the Kerguelen Plateau (KP) in the southern Indian Ocean. Data from fishery observations for 1997–2014 shows that the three skates were widely distributed across the Kerguelen Plateau, showing different spatial distributions, linked mainly with depth. Off Heard Island and McDonald Islands (HIMI), in the southern part of the KP, B. eatonii and B. irrasa were most abundant to the north and northwest of Heard Island, out to the edge of the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and were caught down to depths of 1790 m and 2059 m respectively. The smallest species, B. murrayi, occurred mainly in the shallower waters down to 550 m, and was most abundant to the north and northeast, close to Heard Island. Around Kerguelen Islands, in the northern part of the KP, skates were most abundant between the 500 m and 1000 m contours circling and extending from the islands. Catch rates were modelled using zero-inflated GAMs and GLMs. The catch rates of skates from the trawl fisheries in the Australian EEZ surrounding Heard Island and McDonald Islands have shown little evidence of depletion on the main trawl fishing grounds, although there is evidence of a decrease in the average total length of B. eatonii. The marine reserves and the conservation measures employed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in the HIMI fisheries, appear to provide effective protection for the skates, at least in the shallower waters where the trawl fisheries operate. B. irrasa taken in the deeper waters where longline fishing occurs have shown a slight decline in catch rate over the years of the HIMI fishery. Although all skates are returned to the water from this fishery, survival rates are unknown and careful monitoring should continue to assess the status of these stocks. There appears to be little change in the abundance of the skate species at Kerguelen in the time period. This study provides the first review of skate by-catch across both the HIMI and Kerguelen fisheries. Ongoing monitoring of species specific by-catch levels and further research to determine the important life history parameters of these species are required, particularly for B. irrasa which is taken in both trawl and longline fisheries."
1013,3907,Abundance estimates for the endangered Green Peafowl Pavo muticus in Cambodia: identification of a globally important site for conservation,"The catastrophic decline of the endangered Green peafowl Pavo muticus across its former range; is well known, yet there are only a handful of reliable population estimates for this species from; its remaining range, making global assessment challenging. We present the first rigorous population; estimates for this species from Cambodia, and model the distribution and the relationships; between this species and several environmental covariates from the Core Zone (187,900 ha) of; Seima Protection Forest (SPF), eastern Cambodia. Using distance sampling the abundance of; Green Peafowl in SPF in 2014 is estimated to be 541 (95% CI [252, 1160]). Density surface modelling; was used to predict distribution and relative abundance within the study area, and there was; some evidence that the species prefers areas of deciduous forest, non-forest, and to a lesser extent; semi-evergreen forest. These results highlight the importance of the central and northern sections; of SPF for this species. Furthermore, the analysis suggested that Green Peafowl abundance; is higher in closer proximity to water, yet decreases in closer proximity to human settlement."

1015,2571,"Gyr Falcons, ptarmigan and microtine rodents in northern Sweden","A Gyr Falcon Falco rusticolus population in Northern Sweden (66°N, 17°E) was monitored from 1996 to 2002 in relation to its predator-prey interactions with its main and alternative prey species. Ptarmigan species Lagopus spp., and especially Rock Ptarmigan L. mutus, were the Gyr Falcons' most important prey and constituted more than 90% of the prey biomass. A 21-fold difference in ptarmigan abundance was found across Falcon breeding territories. However, this great variation in prey availability corresponded to only about a 10% shift in Gyr Falcon diet across territories, suggesting that the Falcons were reluctant or unable to compensate for declining ptarmigan availability by using alternative prey categories. Gyr Falcons did not respond functionally to microtine rodent abundance. Their diets were unaffected by a peak in the microtine rodent population cycle when Norwegian Lemmings Lemmus lemmus occurred in high numbers in the study area. Gyr Falcons responded numerically to their prey in two ways. First, there was a reproductive response with a significant relationship between the number of chicks fledged and the number of ptarmigan in the breeding territories. Secondly, although the Gyr Falcons did not utilize microtines as prey, there was a relationship between the microtine rodent abundance and the number of pairs that attempted to breed each year. This could be a result of an indirect community interaction, assuming that other predators switched from ptarmigan to microtines as prey, which could have had a positive effect on the breeding performance of the Gyr Falcons. The Gyr Falcons acted as true specialist predators, and their narrow food niche probably reflected a general lack of suitable alternative prey in the study area. "
1016,2988,"The historical ecology of the large mammal populations of Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, east Africa","Ngorongoro Crater is an ecologically important protected area in Tanzania, east Africa. We review published and unpublished data on the crater's large mammal community from the first recorded visit by a European in 1892 to 2010. Early estimates often exaggerated large herbivore numbers and regular scientific censuses have only been made since the 1960s. Since then, most large herbivore populations have declined, particularly wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, which have been replaced by buffalo Syncerus caffer as the dominant herbivore in terms of biomass. The internationally important population of black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis has reduced from over 100 in the 1960s to around 30 in 2011. The lion Panthera leo population is genetically isolated, has declined since the 1960s and has consistently been held below carrying capacity. Buffalo and warthogs Phacochoerus aethiopicus are relatively recent colonizers. Wild dogs Lycaon pictus were present in the 1960s but are probably now absent. Small numbers of elephants Loxodonta africana use the crater floor and cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus appear to be intermittent visitors. Primary drivers of changes in herbivore populations are disease and vegetation change. Poaching has been implicated as the cause of decline in rhinoceros. Disease associated with anomalous weather conditions appears to be the main driver for population change in lions. Recent scientific research on the large mammal community has largely been focused on lions and rhinoceros. The output of research on other species has not increased since the 1960s. A wider dissemination of research on the crater's mammal populations would help to secure its status as an important site for conservation in the eyes of the wider scientific and conservation community.

1017,3640,"Ecological integrity assessment of the fish assemblages of the Matigulu/Nyoni and Umvoti estuaries, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","The estuarine fish community index (EFCI) and an estuarine fish guild assessment (EFGA) were used in 2004 and 2008 to determine the ecological state and effects of selected ecosystem variables on the Umvoti and Matigulu/Nyoni estuaries. The EFCI indicated that the Matigulu/Nyoni Estuary was in a moderate state and that the Umvoti Estuary was in a poor to very poor state. The EFGA revealed a clear spatial differentiation, based on the estuaries' fish community structures, that was being driven primarily by the freshwater-dominated state of the Umvoti Estuary and the poor water quality of the Umvoti Estuary. The analysis of estuarine fish assemblage characteristics was shown to contribute towards the management and conservation of these systems. "
1018,3044,"Monitoring trends in skink sightings from artificial retreats: influences of retreat design, placement period, and predator abundance","Developing rigorous and repeatable techniques for monitoring a range of taxa is essential for evaluating responses to management. We investigated the use of artificial retreats made from a corrugated roofing material (Onduline) for monitoring Common Skinks (Oligosoma polychroma) over five years (20042009) in the Eglinton Valley, New Zealand. We addressed three questions: (1) how long does it take for skinks to use retreats; (2) which retreat design maximizes detection of skinks; and (3) do numbers of skinks  etected co-vary with mammalian predator indices? We deployed four random transects, each comprising 11 retreats, in grassland habitat using four retreat designs of varying size and number of layers. We checked retreats for skinks at 1-month intervals primarily during summer months, and evaluated rodent and mustelid activity using quarterly  ootprint tracking records. We detected skinks under 30% of retreats one month after deployment and mean numbers of skinks peaked six months after deployment in the first  ear of sampling. Average rate of detection was proportional to retreat area and not related to the number of layers used. Skink counts from artificial retreats declined following  eavy beech masting in autumn 2006 that increased predator activity, but recovered during the following summer as predator activity declined. Artificial retreats are a promising  tool for monitoring skink populations and evaluating their responses to predator abundance and management."
1019,1506,"Variable responses of seabirds to change in marine climate: California Current, 1985–1994.","We conducted annual ship-board surveys to determine the density and distribution of seabirds off central California in relation to marine climate, from 1985 to 1994. Summarized here are results for the sooty shearwater Puffinus griseus, the common murre Uria aalge, and Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus, the 3 most abundant seabirds in the central part of the California Current (91% of seabird abundance and biomass). During the study, sea-surface temperature, wind speed and thermocline depth all increased, salinity decreased and thermocline intensity (slope) showed no consistent trend. Periods of cool water and warm water, as well as offshore and inshore excursions of the shelfbreak front, alternated and were mediated by the Southern Oscillation and upwelling intensity. The responses to climate variation by the 3 seabird species were in accord with their respective morphologies and natural history patterns. All moved closer to shore and away from the shelf-break front (which also weakened). Abundance of the shallow-diving shearwater and auklet decreased dramatically, but those of the deeper-diving murre did not. The shearwater, which nests in the southern hemisphere and is the most mobile of the 3 seabirds, likely changed its migration routes and reduced its association with the California Current. The auklet, which breeds within the study area and lacks mobility, declined in number, most likely due to reduced breeding success and subsequent reduced population size. Remaining auklets moved away from the shelfbreak, but not as far inshore as the shearwater. The murre, which also breeds locally, is the most adaptable owing to its deeper-diving capabilities. It shifted distribution within the study area to feed on alternative prey found throughout the water column."
1020,2607,"Rockhopper and Macaroni Penguin Colonies Absent from Isla Recalada, Chile","Macaroni (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and Southern Rockhopper penguins (E. c. chrysocome) have been classified as Vulnerable due to decreasing populations in recent decades. We report on a survey of Isla Recalada, Chile, a site described historically as containing an estimated population of 10,013 (±570) Rockhopper and 559 Macaroni penguins. Our survey was conducted on 14 and 15 November 2005 to coincide with peak colony attendance. No Rockhopper or Macaroni penguins were observed on Isla Recalada during this period. This survey suggests the population of these penguins has dispersed due to possible anthropogenic pressures or climate variation, and that both species of penguins have been extirpated from Isla Recalada."
1021,1943,Oscillations in large mammal populations: are they related to predation or rainfall?,"Cyclic population dynamics is relatively common among populations of small mammals in high latitudes but is not yet established among African savanna ungulates. However, oscillations may be expected in large mammal populations subject to quasi-periodic oscillations in regional rainfall. We evaluated evidence for environmentally entrained oscillations in a large-mammal predator-prey system in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, where rainfall exhibits quasi-periodic oscillations. The evaluation is based on analysis of comparative changes in the abundance of twelve ungulate species throughout South Africa's KNP using population counts over the period 1965-1996. We present evidence suggesting that (i) twelve ungulate populations display cyclic variability with half-periods ranging between 10 and 18 years, (ii) this variability was associated with lagged rainfall between 3 and 10 years back in the past for different ungulate species, and (iii) the ungulate species respond in contrasting ways to rainfall, with some reaching highest abundance during periods of low rainfall and others under conditions of high rainfall. These findings are not consistent with the response pattern we would expect if the population oscillations were driven directly by the rainfall influence on food availability. Instead they seem to be an outcome of predator-prey interactions, which are entrained by the effect of rainfall on habitat conditions affecting the relative susceptibility of the different ungulate species to predation."
1022,4160,"Distribution, body length, and abundance of blue shark and shortfin mako offshore of northeastern Japan, as determined from observed pelagic longline data, 2000–2014"," Longline surveys have been conducted in the Northwest Pacific Ocean from 2000 to 2014 using chartered commercial longline vessels. Each year, two cruises were conducted offshore of northeastern Japan from mid-April to mid-June. For each longline set during the surveys, onboard scientists collected detailed biological information about the species caught, such as the size and sex, and recorded the catch numbers for all species. Blue shark (Prionace glauca) and shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) have eurythermal distributions, but the application of a generalized additive model (GAM) showed that the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) at catch sites positive for shortfin mako were warmer than those for blue shark. On the basis of the GAM, the probabilities of occurrence of both sharks differed by size category: small sharks had a narrower SST range than that of large sharks. Most catches of both sharks were juveniles, and the nominal catch rate of blue shark was more than 10 times that of shortfin mako. The standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) for both species was calculated using a generalized linear model (GLM) with negative binomial errors, or a delta-lognormal GLM. The standardized CPUE for blue shark in the second quarter of the year peaked in the mid-2000s and then decreased, but it has been increasing since 2012. The CPUE for shortfin mako in the second quarter generally increased, with fluctuations."
1023,3610,The intriguing dynamics of Rastrineobola argentea fishery in the Kenyan waters of Lake Victoria,"The Lake Victoria ecosystem once hosted a diverse fish community dominated by a large species flock of haplochromine cichlids. Today this fish assemblage is highly altered by anthropogenic activities, with at least half of the indigenous species either extinct or very rare. The fishery has been reduced to three fishes of economic importance: introduced Nile Perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and Indigenous Minnow, Rastrineobola argentea, locally known as Omena. Decline in fish stocks in the lake is still continuing; however, in order to rejuvenate stocks therein, a fishing ban (closed season) was imposed in November, 2001 between 1 April and 31 July of each year through a Kenyan government gazette and legal notice (L.N.214/2003). The ban was not only intended to protect the Omena fishery but was also used to anchor efforts towards protecting and rejuvenating dwindling stocks in the lake. However, whether the Kenyan approach has made any gains for the region is still equivocal. It is on this basis that we reviewed existing information on both historical and current stock levels of R. argentea, and the closed fishery implication on the livelihoods of the riparian communities. Our review results indicate that Omena biomass in Lake Victoria has increased considerably from approximately 500,000 MT in 2001 to 911,328 MT in 2011. Rastrineobola argentea is now the most important fish stock by mass in Kenyan waters contributing almost 61.5% of the total fish landings (10,339.0 MT), with ex-vessel value of total fishers' earnings of about Kshs. 207 million (approx. USD 2.5 million). In response to the emerging uncertainties regarding the closed season or ban, we recommend and advise for a balanced, win-win approach balancing the biological cycle of stocks against the socio-political and economic issues, in order to sustain the stocks and enable the fisher folks to eke their daily food and earnings.

1024,3625,"Spatial and temporal gradients in artisanal fisheries of a large Neotropical reservoir, the Itaipu Reservoir, Brazil","Physical, chemical, and biological gradients along reservoirs are clear and exhibit marked spatial and temporal variations. These variations are rarely quantified and may produce spatial gradients in fisheries. We analyzed trends in total yield and gradients and relationships between catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and some characteristics of the fishery in the large Neotropical Itaipu Reservoir in Brazil. Data on the artisanal fisheries were collected over an 11-year period (414 213 daily trips). Annual yield (especially after 1993) and CPUE (annual total and for each species) decreased over the studied period. A clear longitudinal pattern in the CPUE values for the main species was recognized, and this pattern presented a significant relationship with the type of gear and characteristics of the vessels used in the fisheries. The decline in yield and CPUE is apparently due to changes in trophic state, as well as to the construction of reservoirs upstream from the region and to overfishing. It is clear that the spatial zonation influenced fish species distribution along the reservoir and, therefore, the fishery. We conclude that for this large Neotropical reservoir, spatial gradient cannot be ignored in management plans, and this appears to be true for any reservoir that exhibits zonation. "
1025,4263,Stochastic density effects on adult fish survival and implications for population fluctuations,"The degree to which population fluctuations arise from variable adult survival relative to variable recruitment has been debated widely for marine organisms. Disentangling these effects remains challenging because data generally are not sufficient to evaluate if and how adult survival rates are regulated by stochasticity and/or population density. Using unique time series for a largely unexploited reef fish, we found both population density and stochastic food supply impacted adult survival. The estimated effect of variable survival on adult abundance (both mean and variability) rivalled that of variable recruitment. Moreover, we show density-dependent adult survival can dampen impacts of stochastic recruitment. Thus, food variability may alter population fluctuations by simultaneously regulating recruitment and compensatory adult survival. These results provide an additional mechanism for why intensified density-independent mortality (via harvest or other means) amplifies population fluctuations and emphasises need for research evaluating the causes and consequences of variability in adult survival."
1026,3609,Fluctuations in food supply drive recruitment variation in a marine fish,"Reproductive rates and survival of young in animal populations figure centrally in generating management and conservation strategies. Model systems suggest that food supply can drive these often highly variable properties, yet for many wild species, quantifying such effects and assessing their implications have been challenging. We used spatially explicit time series of a well-studied marine reef fish (black surfperch Embiotoca jacksoni) and its known prey resources to evaluate the extent to which fluctuations in food supply influenced production of young by adults and survival of young to subadulthood. Our analyses reveal: (i) variable food available to both adults and to their offspring directly produced an order of magnitude variation in the number of young-of-year (YOY) produced per adult and (ii) food available to YOY produced a similar magnitude of variation in their subsequent survival. We also show that such large natural variation in vital rates can significantly alter decision thresholds (biological reference points) important for precautionary management. These findings reveal how knowledge of food resources can improve understanding of population dynamics and reduce risk of overharvest by more accurately identifying periods of low recruitment. "
1027,2037,Competition for shifting resources in the southern Benguela upwelling: Seabirds versus purse-seine fisheries,"In the southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem off the west coast of South Africa, seabird populations are decreasing dramatically because of reduced availability of pelagic fish. We tested the hypothesis that the west coast fishing industry is competing for the remaining stocks of anchovy and sardine with the largest colony of Vulnerable Cape Gannets (Morus capensis) along the Atlantic coast. Using GPS-tracking of the birds, echo-sounding of pelagic fish, and vessel log books, we located overlap areas between bird foraging ranges, pelagic fish distribution, and fishing activities. We then compared fish catches by gannets and vessels within their joint foraging zones. In October 2007, purse-seine fishing grounds and gannet foraging areas overlapped by only 13%. However, for a 1-month period, the amount of fish removed from this area by purse-seine boats amounted to 41% of the food requirements of the 72,000 gannets breeding on Malgas Island (25% of the world population). The fishery's catch in this area is significant in terms of its potential impact on gannets, but comprises only 3.6% of total fishery catch. Based on this finding, the rapidly decreasing size of the gannet colony and the stated objectives of South Africa's Marine Living Resources Act of 1998, the case for considering and experimenting with at-sea 'no-take' areas for the purse-seine fishery is strong. Efforts to establish whether 'no-take' fishing zones increase food availability for top predators is an important next step in conservation of the southern Benguela Ecosystem. "
1028,2804,Density dependence and population dynamics of black rhinos (Diceros bicornis michaeli) in Kenya's rhino sanctuaries,"Density-dependent feedback mechanisms provide insights into the population dynamics and interactions of large herbivores with their ecosystem. Sex ratio also has particularly important implications for growth rates of many large mammal populations through its influence on reproductive potential. Therefore, the interrelationships between density-dependent factors, comprising density, sex ratio and underlying growth rates (r) were examined for the Eastern black rhino (Diceros bicornis michaeli) living in three rhino sanctuaries in Kenya using four population models. The exponential and logistic models gave similar results and the former were accepted because they better portrayed the actual situation on the ground. Sex ratios in all sanctuary populations were positively correlated with r but interpreted with realization of other factors also affecting r. We caution that the results of population models should be interpreted alongside ground-truthed observations. We recommend that future translocation strategies should take into account sex and age structures of the donor population, while future studies of density dependence should take into account both biotic and abiotic factors."
1029,3641,"Population dynamics, life-history traits of and habitat use by two sympatric nothobranchiid fishes in a tropical stream, Kainji Lake Basin, Nigeria","Population dynamics and life-history traits of two sympatric nothobranchiid killifishes, Epiplatys bifasciatus and E. spilargyreius, were studied for 24 months in an intermittent stream in the Kainji Lake Basin, Nigeria. Epiplatys bifasciatus was more abundant throughout the study period, but monthly abundance of both species followed the same pattern. For both species, growth parameters and life-history strategies are characterised by small size, high growth rate, early maturity, high reproductive effort through daily spawning, short generation time, short life span and high mortality rate. Both species reproduce throughout the year, with peak periods of recruitment during the February to April and October to November periods. The population structures showed a preponderance of females over males, while males attained a larger total length than females. Three habitat types (vegetated pool, vegetated riffle, and marsh) were preferred by both species, whilst unvegetated habitats were avoided. Epiplatys spilargyreius was fairly specific in its habitat preference, with a significant positive correlation (r = 0.65, p < 0.05) to marshy habitat, whereas E. bifasciatus showed some habitat-use plasticity.

1030,1906,Dung survey bias and elephant population estimates in southern Mozambique,"We used dung surveys to estimate population size and extracted an age structure from boli diameters for the elephants living in the Maputo Elephant Reserve. Our estimate was based on published defecation rates, dung decay rates, distance-sampling techniques and 1,672 dung piles encountered on 204 line-transects. The reserve had at least 311 (95% CI: 198-490) elephants at a density of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.38-0.94) per km2. However, observer bias reduced effective strip widths and inflated estimates and their confidence limits. The age structure extrapolated from dung measurements indicated few newborn calves compared with other populations. To detect population changes of 2-5% at 80% power, dung surveys should be carried out every second year for the next 20 years using 100 transects of at least 500 m each. Comparison with a 1995 dung survey suggests that the population is stable and that previous fears of a major population decline during the civil war have no foundation. "
1031,2600,The first five years of the Italian‐Australian joint programme on the Adélie Penguin: An overview,"About 2000 breeding pairs of Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliaë) nest in Edmonson Point (Wood Bay, 74°21’ S, 165°10’ E). The penguin colony is located on a raised terrace, divided into 13 discrete small units or colonies separated by unoccupied areas, where South polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki) nest. Colony layout, breeding chronology, breeding success, diet, and foraging areas were studied for five consecutive austral summers. Satellite transmitters, time-depth recorders, and electronic tagging were used for monitoring feeding behaviour and nest attendance. An Automated Penguin Monitoring System was installed which records weight, identity, and direction of penguins as they move between the sea and their breeding colony. So far, the results of this study are documentation on colony trends, breeding biology, and differences in foraging strategies at different stages of the reproductive period and during different study seasons.

1032,1350,Estimating the population density of Mongolian gazelles Procapra gutturosa by driving long-distance transects,"Despite a ≥75% reduction in the geographic range of Mongolian gazelles Procapra gutturosa over the past 50 years, the species is still recognized as the most numerous large grassland herbivore in Asia. Its actual population size, however, is still disputed, and we therefore estimated its numbers in an 80,000 km2 area in the eastern steppe of Mongolia by driving long-distance (1,200-1,400 km) transect surveys during spring and autumn 2000-2002. Quantitative estimates of gazelle numbers are essential for understanding the causes of changes in the population, and thus devising conservation strategies to assure its long-term viability. Observed herds ranged in size from 1-4,000; among surveys, median herd sizes varied from 14-42. Density estimates varied from 10.7 gazelles km-2 in spring to 11.5 gazelles km-2 in autumn, with total population estimates of 803,820 (483,790-1,330,100 95% confidence interval) and 870,625 (499,432-1,491,278 95% confidence interval), respectively. Confidence limits were wide, and to obtain a coefficient of variation of 20%, transect lengths would need to be extended three- to four-fold. Until more efficient means for conducting population surveys can be implemented, driving long-distance transects, combined with distance analysis, seem to provide the best quantitative estimate of Mongolian gazelle populations.

1033,1561,Genetic Origin and Success of Reintroduced White Storks,"After their local extinction in 1954, White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) were reintroduced to Sweden in 1989. The founder population for the reintroduced birds originated in North Africa, rather than from the closest breeding population in northeastern Europe (defined here as native). A number of wild storks have immigrated spontaneously, and a few others of native origin have been acquired for captive breeding. Over the 17 years, 103 of the 241 breeding events by free storks have been by pairs in which at least one parent had some native ancestry. The pedigree for all birds is known, and from this I calculated the proportion of native ancestry for each individual, the inbreeding coefficient, and the kinship between parents. I analyzed how these genetic factors, together with rainfall during breeding, supplementary feeding, and management of the storks (whether parents were born or raised in captivity or free), affected brood size. I also analyzed whether storks with native ancestry had a higher likelihood of migrating. Together with weather and supplementary feeding during the breeding period, genetic origin strongly affected breeding performance. Pairs with entirely native ancestry had on average twice as many chicks as those of entirely African ancestry. Inbreeding and kinship between parents, or management of the parents, did not influence breeding performance significantly. Reproductive success of the African storks in Sweden is so low that they cannot form a sustainable population. In addition, birds with some native ancestry were more likely to migrate from Sweden than those with entirely African ancestry. The difference in performance between native and African storks may be due either to local adaptations or to the bottleneck that the African founding population went through during captive breeding. Overall, my results imply that use of a correct source population for reintroduction programs may be of greater consequence for the program's success than other genetic considerations or management of individuals.

1034,2410,"Breeding success, dispersal, and long-term changes in a population of Eagle Owls Bubo bubo in southeastern Sweden 1952-1996","In 1950 when the eagle owl became legally protected in Sweden, the species was nearly extinct in most parts of the country and survived only with a small population in the southeastern part of the country, along the Baltic Sea coast. This population has been studied in 1952-1996. Recoveries of birds ringed in the study area demonstrated that dispersal was limited; post-fledging dispersal was on average 56.8 km in the first year of life. In birds older than one year the mean distance from the hatching site to the site of recovery was 47.7 km. The mean brood size in successful nests was 1.47 young. However, the mean reproductive success calculated for all occupied territories was only 0.68 young per pair and year. Among all pairs, 43.7% bred successfully and 24.7% failed. Thus, each year 31.6% of the pairs stayed in the territory without breeding. For an extended part of this long term study, reproduction seems to have been just enough to maintain a stable population size in the study area. Only in the years 1986-90, there seemed to be a surplus of young produced in the study population resulting in new breeding pairs, predominantly ourside the old study area. From a national project with captive breeding, 2759 young eagle owls have been released in nearly all parts of Sweden. Around 1982, the number of pairs originating from the released birds was in equilibrium with the original 'wild' population, and in 1995 the released birds and their descendants were about twice as many. In recent years probably many pairs are of mixed origin, and the mixing of the two populations is likely to increase in the future. In total, there were about 400 territories occupied by eagle owls in Sweden in 1996."
1035,4397,"Shorebirds in the Gediz Delta (İzmir, Turkey): breeding and wintering abundances, distributions, and seasonal occurrences","The present study describes breeding and wintering abundances, distributions, and seasonal occurrences of shorebirds (waders) in the Gediz Delta (İzmir-Turkey). Breeding abundance and distribution, and wintering abundance data were collected by carrying out breeding bird surveys in 2002 and 2006, and waterbird censuses between 1990 and 2007, respectively. Seasonal occurrences were determined using 432 different observations corresponding to 5043 different records between 1990 and 2007. Thirty-eight wader species were observed with a weekly average of 22.5 ± 4.0. Breeding evidence was obtained for 9 species in 2002 and 8 species in 2006. Average number of waders identified during yearly mid-winter waterbird census was 8731 ± 2530, corresponding to 42.2 ± 25.9% of the whole wintering wader population in Turkey. During the present study 11 species were encountered in internationally significant numbers. The Gediz Delta is one of the key sites in the Western Palearctic region for breeding, wintering, and migrating waders. "
1036,4398,Impacts of anthropogenic activities and habitat degradation on breeding waterbirds,"We investigated the efects of threats on breeding waterbirds in the Gediz Delta, Turkey. Breeding Bird Surveys were conducted in 2002 and 2006. Te survey area comprised 305 UTM grids of 1 × 1 km2. Populations and distributions of breeding birds were compared between 2002 and 2006 for the UTM grids under threat and without any threat using paired samples t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and GIS. Urbanization, industrialization, pollution, overgrazing, disturbance, and illegal reed cutting and burning were identifed in 151 (49.5%) of 305 grids in 2002. Te mean total number of breeding birds per UTM grid slightly decreased in areas under threat, but signifcantly increased (P < 0.05) in areas without threat. Te mean total number of breeding waterbirds signifcantly decreased (P < 0.05) in both the grids under and without threat. Out of 30 waterbirds breeding in grids under threat, 23 shifed their breeding locations. Te total number of breeding pairs of 9 waterbirds decreased, 7 species increased, and 6 species were stable. Te maximum breeding code of 6, maximum number of breeding pairs of 11, total number of observed birds of 11, and frequency of occurrence of 15 species signifcantly decreased in UTM grids under threat. Treats have signifcantly afected (P < 0.05) the breeding populations of bird species even in a short period of 4 years. "
1037,4337,"Status and development of the population of the globally threatened Dalmatian Pelican,Pelecanus crispus, in Turkey","The Dalmatian Pelican, Pelecanus crispus (Bruch, 1832), used to be a widespread breeding species in Turkey in the past. Until the 1990s, approximately 473–763 pairs were breeding at 20–25 sites. Of these, 53–59% have been lost due to drainage of wetlands, 17–19% due to direct persecution, 16–22% due to both drainage and persecution, and 6–8% due to water level increase. Currently there are only five active breeding colonies: Gediz Delta, Manyas Lake, Büyük Menderes Delta, Aktaş Lake and Işıklı Lake. The colony at Işıklı Lake was discovered in 2010 and comprises 6 pairs. Since 2000, the total breeding population of Dalmatian Pelicans increased moderately from 220–250 to 277–341 pairs. Likewise, the wintering population has also increased from 352 up to 2,344 individuals, which seems to be linked with the increase in the breeding population in the region. Nevertheless, the population size still renders the species susceptible to the risks affecting small populations. "
1038,3507,Unmarked individuals in mark-recapture studies: comparisons of marked and unmarked southern elephant seals at Marion Island,"The presence of unmarked individuals is common in mark-recapture study populations; however, their origin and significance in terms of population dynamics remain poorly understood. At Marion Island, southern Indian Ocean, where virtually all southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina pups born annually (1983-2008) were marked in a long-term mark-resight study, large numbers of unmarked seals occur. Unmarked seals originate either from marker (tag) loss or from immigration. We aimed to identify patterns in the occurrence of marked and unmarked individuals that will allude to the possible origin and significance of the untagged component of the population, predicting that tag loss will add untagged seals to mainly adult age categories whereas migrating untagged individuals will be mostly juveniles. We fitted a generalized linear model using the factors month, year and age-class to explain the relative abundance of untagged seals (tag ratio) from 1997 to 2009. Site usage of untagged seals relative to tagged seals was assessed using a binomial test. Untagged seals, predominantly juveniles, were present in the highest proportions relative to tagged seals during the winter haulout (tagged seals/total seals less than 0.3) and the lowest proportion (approximately 0.5) during the female breeding haulout, increasing in relative abundance from 1997 to 2009. Untagged seals were distributed evenly across suitable haulout sites while tagged seals displayed high local site fidelity and occurred in greater numbers at or near large breeding beaches. Untagged seals are considered to be mostly migrant seals that disperse from other islands within the southern Indian Ocean and haul out at Marion Island during non-breeding haulouts in particular. Some of these seals immigrate to the breeding population, which can be a key component of the local population dynamics. We emphasize the need for mark-recapture studies to evaluate the role of the unmarked component of a population, thereby inducing a more confident estimation of demographic parameters from the marked sample.

1039,2977,"Chiriqui Beach, Panama, the most important Leatherback  nesting beach in Central America","Chiriqui Beach, in the Comarca Ngöbe-Buglé on the Caribbean coast of Panama, is the most important nesting beach for leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in Caribbean Central America. Beach surveys during the 2003 and 2004 nesting seasons documented 3077 leatherback nests in one season and a minimum of 234 individual leatherbacks. Monitoring of nest fate revealed that predation by dogs represents the greatest human-related survival threat to leatherbacks at Chiriqui Beach, although the killing of leatherbacks from the same nesting population on beaches near the Panama-Costa Rica border also is of concern.

1040,1369,The formation and growth of seabird colonies: Audouin's gull as a case study,"1. Simulations of a stochastic, individual-based predictive model were used to investigate the ecological processes relating to the formation and growth of colonies (local populations) of Audouin's Gull (Larus audouinii Payraudeau). A colony was established in 1981 at the Ebro Delta (in the north-western Mediterranean) and since then, the colony has grown dramatically at an average rate of 44% per year, such that by 1997 it held 65% of the total world population of this species. 2. Our model shows that the observed growth in the colony cannot be explained without large-scale immigration of individuals into the colony. Although immigration occurred in most of the years throughout the study, years with an absence of immigration and even with net emigration from the colony also occurred. 3. The most likely source of immigrants was the colony on the Chafarinas Islands (655 km southwards from the Ebro Delta), which has been the largest known colony excluding the Delta in every year since 1981. However, immigrants from other neighbouring colonies apart from the Chafarinas, and even from other colonies beyond the western Mediterranean metapopulation were presumably also involved. 4. Immigration from other colonies is likely to be driven by temporal heterogeneity in the relative quality of the different colonies, combined with individuals dispersing to search for and select the most suitable breeding place, in order to increase their fitness. However, breeding success at the Ebro Delta colony was not autocorrelated from one year to the next, suggesting that the predictability of the environment was low. 5. Predictability was also low in other colonies within the metapopulation, independently of their size or relative quality. Results suggest that the presence of conspecifics (rather than local reproductive success) may be more important for immigrants in breeding site selection. 6. Colonization of the Ebro Delta was probably facilitated by the effective protection of the site against human disturbances, which produced a new, empty, high quality site for prospecting gulls. This may be considered a stochastic and density independent event, of a type that may have been a much more important influence on seabird colony formation than has been appreciated."
1041,2491,A demographic description of the recovery of the Vulnerable Spanish imperial eagle Aquila adalberti,"The population of the Vulnerable Spanish imperial eagle Aquila adalberti has experienced a gradual recovery from 38 pairs (1974) to 198 (2004). We analysed the spatial and temporal variation of the demographic parameters for 19812004. Annual productivity was 1.191.32 chicks per female and adult survival rate 0.9180.986. Survival during the post-fledging period was 0.894 and the annual survival rate of the dispersing individuals was 0.561. Three phases of population evolution were distinguished: growth (19811993), stability or slight decrease (19941999) and growth (20002004). Variation in adult survival seems to explain this pattern for the first two periods. However, a large disparity between the observed growth rate and the modelled population growth in 20002004 is best explained if we assume that a decrease in the age of recruitment took place. This is supported by the recent increase in the frequency of non-adult birds in breeding pairs. The survival of unpaired eagles in dispersal areas is becoming more important for the maintenance of current population growth. Spatial variation of adult survival and breeding success is not congruent with the observed growth rate of the population, which suggests the existence of an important flow of individuals between populations. These results highlight the importance of addressing the conservation of the species from a global perspective and the need to focus on adult survival in breeding territories and on non-adult survival in dispersal areas.

1042,3494,Alternative error distribution models for standardization of catch rates of non-target species from a pelagic longline fishery: billfish species in the Venezuelan tuna longline fishery,"Alternative error distributions were evaluated for calculating indices of relative abundance for non-target species using catch and effort data from commercial fisheries. A general procedure is presented for testing the underlying assumptions of different error distributions. Catch rates, from an observer program, of billfish caught mainly as bycatch in a pelagic tuna longline fishery in the Western Central Atlantic were standardized. Although catches of billfishes are not common in pelagic tuna longline fisheries, these fisheries are one of the main sources of fishing mortality for these stocks in the central Atlantic due to the magnitude and spatial extent of longline fishing effort. Billfish CPUE data are highly skewed with a large proportion of zero observations. Delta distribution models can accommodate this type of data, and involve modeling the probability of a non-zero observation and the catch rate given that the catch is non-zero separately. Three different Delta models were compared against other error distributions, including the lognormal, log-gamma, and Poisson. Diagnostic checks and deviance table analyses were performed to identify the best error distribution and the set of factors and interactions that most adequately explained the observed variability. The results indicated that the Delta-lognormal model (a binomial error distribution for the probability of a non-zero catch and lognormal error for the positive catch rates) complied best with the underlying characteristics of the data set. Analyses of catch rates for blue marlin, white marlin and sailfish confirmed the spatio-temporal nature of their distribution in the central Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. Also, the analyses indicated that catch rates of billfish differed among fishing vessel types; larger vessels had a higher probability of catching blue marlin, the more oceanic-oriented species, and lower probabilities of catching the more coastal-oriented species white marlin and sailfish. Standardized catch rates indicated in general a lower relative abundance for blue and white marlin in the most recent years, although estimated confidence intervals overlap through the years especially for white marlin.

Ringing numbers indicated longterm trends of increase or decrease in about one fourth of these species. Species with a clearly increasing trend are Acrocephalus scirpaceus, Hippolais icterina and Carpodacus erythrinus.

During a 14-day survey carried out in the protected area in October and November 2000 no evidence of recent occurrence of ostriches was found, and it appears that the population size has dramatically declined in its favoured habitat. The species seems to have been severely persecuted during the civil war of 1991-1997. Although a small population had remained in the protected area after the conflict, the occurrence of further poaching suggests that remaining individuals are threatened with extirpation."
1046,4208,Habitat selection and migration of Caiman crocodilus crocodilus in a swamp and swamp-forest habitat in northern Suriname,"Swamp-bordered river parts usually have higher caiman densities than forest-bordered river parts. In the Coesewijne River area, caimans showed a preference for shallow water. Most juveniles and subadults were found in a section with much aquatic vegetation. This tributary drains a large grass-swamp, which is an important nesting area. High caiman density was mainly caused by the high number of juveniles born in the area. Caimans >3 yr of age were generally equally distributed between the main river and the tributary although some seasonal differences were apparent. With receding water levels these caimans left the tributary, or they moved to deeper parts; with rising water levels many caimans entered the creek and finally dispersed into the inundated swamp. At the start of the dry season c52% of the subadult and adult caimans and 68% of the 2nd year caimans returned to the location they were found before the rainy season. Caimans were rather sedentary; longest distance between 2 recordings was 3 km. -from Authors"
1047,835,"Population structure, growth, and reproduction in a Vancouver island population of the salamander Plethodon vehiculum","Surface activity of adult western red-backed salamander consisted of spring (March-June) and autumn (September-November) periods with courtship taking place in autumn. Juveniles remained above ground in midsummer after adults had disappeared, probably into underground refugia. Small salamanders (SVL ≤30 mm) were found under small rocks and away from discrete cover objects in the leaf litter and under moss more frequently than medium-sized and large individuals. Growth was rapid during the first year of life and declined steadily thereafter with little growth taking place after sexual maturity was reached. Females attained sexual maturity at a larger size and reached a greater SVL than males. Individual females reproduced at intervals of ≥2 yr. Annual variations in weather probably have a major effect on specific values of population parameters. -from Authors"
1048,792,"Demography of a Large Herbivore, the Greater Kudu Tragelaphus-Strepsiceros, in Relation to Rainfall","Kudu populations in 2 areas of the Kruger National Park differing in mean rainfall increased in 1974-78 then declined in 1978-83. Because of high annual variability in juvenile recruitment, no stable age distribution was attained. Survival rates of juveniles (including prenatal losses), yearlings and old females (>6 yr of age) were significantly correlated with the preceding annual rainfall total. Rainfall over the late wet season exerted the strongest influence. A negative relation was evident between survival and preceding biomass density of kudus. For prime females only a weak relation between survival rates and both variables combined was shown in the lower rainfall study area. Survival rates were significantly correlated with resource supply relative to population demand, as indexed by the rainfall/biomass ratio, except in the case of prime females. The higher kudu density in one area counterbalanced the higher mean rainfall there. Juvenile survival post-conception functioned as the key factor causing population fluctuations as well as being density-dependent. Prime females 2-5 yr old conferred a degree of population resilience to drought due to their insensitivity to resource limitations. Rainfall is presumed to act through its effects on the food supply, in particular of high quality components such as forbs, but the effects of wet season rainfall on juvenile survival appeared to be partially density-independent. Predation was probably responsible for a background mortality level of 5-10% per annum even among prime-aged animals. Although all mortality was probably mediated by predation, except during a severe drought year, fluctuations in mortality were evidently dependent on nutritional well-being as influenced by rainfall relative to kudu density. -from Author"
1049,2072,Effects of patch quality and network structure on patch occupancy dynamics of a yellow-bellied marmot metapopulation,"1. The presence/absence of a species at a particular site is the simplest form of data that can be collected during ecological field studies. We used 13 years (1990-2002) of survey data to parameterize a stochastic patch occupancy model for a metapopulation of the yellow-bellied marmot in Colorado, and investigated the significance of particular patches and the influence of site quality, network characteristics and regional stochasticity on the metapopulation persistence. 2. Persistence of the yellow-bellied marmot metapopulation was strongly dependent on the high quality colony sites, and persistence probability was highly sensitive to small changes in the quality of these sites. 3. A relatively small number of colony sites was ultimately responsible for the regional persistence. However, lower quality satellite sites also made a significant contribution to long-term metapopulation persistence, especially when regional stochasticity was high. 4. The northern network of the marmot metapopulation was more stable compared to the southern network, and the persistence of the southern network depended heavily on the northern network. 5. Although complex models of metapopulation dynamics may provide a more accurate description of metapopulation dynamics, such models are data-intensive. Our study, one of the very few applications of stochastic patch occupancy models to a mammalian species, suggests that stochastic patch occupancy models can provide important insights into metapopulation dynamics using data that are easy to collect."
1050,1374,Viruses of the Serengeti: patterns of infection and mortality in African lions,"1. We present data on the temporal dynamics of six viruses that infect lions (Panthera leo) in the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. These populations have been studied continuously for the past 30 years, and previous research has documented their seroprevalence for feline herpesvirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus and canine distemper virus (CDV). A seventh virus, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), was absent from these animals. 2. Comprehensive analysis reveals that feline herpesvirus and FIV were consistently prevalent at high levels, indicating that they were endemic in the host populations. Feline calici-, parvo- and coronavirus, and CDV repeatedly showed a pattern of seroprevalence that was indicative of discrete disease epidemics: a brief period of high exposure for each virus was followed by declining seroprevalence. 3. The timing of viral invasion suggests that different epidemic viruses are associated with different minimum threshold densities of susceptible hosts. Furthermore, the proportion of susceptibles that became infected during disease outbreaks was positively correlated with the number of susceptible hosts at the beginning of each outbreak. 4. Examination of the relationship between disease outbreaks and host fitness suggest that these viruses do not affect birth and death rates in lions, with the exception of the 1994 outbreak of canine distemper virus. Although the endemic viruses (FHV and FIV) were too prevalent to measure precise health effects, there was no evidence that FIV infection reduced host longevity."
1051,3461,Effects of trophy hunting on lion and leopard populations in Tanzania,"Tanzania holds most of the remaining large populations of African lions (Panthera leo) and has extensive areas of leopard habitat (Panthera pardus), and both species are subjected to sizable harvests by sport hunters. As a first step toward establishing sustainable management strategies, we analyzed harvest trends for lions and leopards across Tanzania's 300,000 km2 of hunting blocks. We summarize lion population trends in protected areas where lion abundance has been directly measured and data on the frequency of lion attacks on humans in high-conflict agricultural areas. We place these findings in context of the rapidly growing human population in rural Tanzania and the concomitant effects of habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and cultural practices. Lion harvests declined by 50% across Tanzania between 1996 and 2008, and hunting areas with the highest initial harvests suffered the steepest declines. Although each part of the country is subject to some form of anthropogenic impact from local people, the intensity of trophy hunting was the only significant factor in a statistical analysis of lion harvest trends. Although leopard harvests were more stable, regions outside the Selous Game Reserve with the highest initial leopard harvests again showed the steepest declines. Our quantitative analyses suggest that annual hunting quotas be limited to 0.5 lions and 1.0 leopard/1000 km2 of hunting area, except hunting blocks in the Selous Game Reserve, where harvests should be limited to 1.0 lion and 3.0 leopards/1000 km2.

1052,2318,"Ecological change, Group Territoriality, and Population Dynamics in Serengeti Lions","Territorial behavior is expected to buffer populations against short-term environmental perturbations, but we have found that group living in African lions causes a complex response to long-term ecological change. Despite numerous gradual changes in prey availability and vegetative cover, regional populations of Serengeti lions remained stable for 10- to 20-year periods and only shifted to new equilibria in sudden leaps. Although gradually improving environmental conditions provided sufficient resources to permit the subdivision of preexisting territories, regional lion populations did not expand until short-term conditions supplied enough prey to generate large cohorts of surviving young. The results of a simulation model show that the observed pattern of ""saltatory equilibria"" results from the lions' grouping behavior."
1053,897,Case-Study of a Population Bottleneck - Lions of the Ngorongoro Crater,":  Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, form a small and naturally isolated population. In 1962, the Crater lions suffered an epizootic that reduced the population to nine females and one male. An additional seven males apparently immigrated into the Crater in 1964–1965, but there has been no further immigration into the Crater in the past 25 years. By 1975, the population had recovered to its current level of 75‐125 animals. All members of the current Crater population are descended from only 15 founders, and over the years there has been considerable variance in the reproductive success of both sexes. The Crater was probably colonized by lions from the nearby Serengeti ecosystem and the contemporary Crater lion population shows a significant lack of genetic diversity compared to the much larger Serengeti population. The detailed reproductive history of the Crater population was incorporated into a series of stochastic computer simulations that generated distributions of expected allele frequencies under different sets of initial conditions. The simulations suggest that the Crater population may have passed through previous bottlenecks before 1962 but that the level of heterozygosity in the breeding population has been declining since the mid‐1970s, regardless of the population's genetic composition in the 1960s. High levels of inbreeding are correlated with increased levels of sperm abnormality in lions and there is evidence that the reproductive performance of the Crater lions has decreased as a result of decreasing heterozygosity.

1054,3519,Fish corallivory on a pocilloporid reef and experimental coral responses to predation.,"This study examined the effects of the Guineafowl pufferfish (Arothron meleagris), a major corallivore in the Eastern Pacific, on pocilloporid corals on a reef at Gorgona Island, Colombia. Pufferfish occurred at a density of 171.2 individuals ha-1 and fed at a rate of 1.8 bites min-1, which produced a standing bite density of 366.2 bites m-2. We estimate that approximately 15.6 % of the annual pocilloporid carbonate production is removed by the pufferfish population. Examination of the predation effect on individual pocilloporid colonies revealed that although nubbins exposed to corallivory had lower linear growth, they gained similar weight and became thicker than those protected from it. Additionally, colonies with simulated predation injuries (on up to 75 % of branch tips) healed successfully and maintained growth rates similar to those of uninjured colonies. Despite the high corallivore pressure exerted by pufferfish on this reef, we conclude that they have a low destructive impact on Pocillopora colonies as corals can maintain their carbonate production rate while effectively recovering from partial predation. Due to its influence on colony morphology, pufferfish predation may increase environmentally induced morphological variability in Pocillopora. "

Natural recruitment was inconsistent in the 1960s, and with the additional impact of Libby Dam since the 1970s, the wild population now consists of an aging cohort of large, old fish. Jolly-Seber population estimates have declined from approximately 7,000 white sturgeon in the late 1970s to 760 fish in 2000. At the current mortality rate of 9% per year, fewer than 500 adults will remain by 2005 and fewer than 50 by 2030. At current growth and maturity rates, hatchery fish being released since 1992 should begin recruiting to the adult population around 2020. Population projections describe a significant bottleneck in spawner numbers as the wild population declines but hatchery fish have not yet matured. Only 113-203 wild females are projected to contribute to hatchery broodstock over the expected life span of the current population. With current levels of hatchery production, the population is projected to stabilize at about 3,000 adults - although numbers predicted by these population simulations are extremely sensitive to estimates of survival rate The next generation is expected to be produced primarily from hatchery spawning of wild adults Habitat restoration measures to improve survival and rearing conditions for the wild component are critical to recovery efforts in the long term; however, recovery measures should also include a balanced consideration of the short-term and long-term risks faced by the white sturgeon population. Use of increasing numbers of broodstock in the hatchery will reduce risks of genetic founder effects. Increasing numbers of juveniles produced per family in the hatchery will provide a hedge for uncertainty in broodstock availability as the population declines. "
1056,2632,"Status of the Humboldt Penguin in Peru, 1999-2000","The status of the Humboldt Penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) was investigated in Peru after the 1997-98 El Niño event, the strongest of the last century. Penguin numbers along the southern and central coast of Peru (97% of the total) did not differ significantly between 1999 and 2000; tire average number was 4,425 individuals. In 1999, the proportion of juveniles (one-year-old birds) was only 0.2% compared with 7% in 2000, probably as a result of the 1997-98 El Niño. Penguins were found from La Foca Island (5°12'S) to Punta Coles (17°42'S). However, the majority (78%) were clustered in five localities, Punta San Juan (36%), San Juanito Islet (11%). Hornillos Island (10%), Pachacamac Island (12%) and Tres Puertas (9%). The size and distribution of penguin colonies have changed over the last 15 years. Penguins have abandoned sites at Punta Corio, Sombrerillo and Morro Sama, and have decreased significantly in numbers in Punta San Fernando and Punta La Chira, where human disturbance has increased, mainly due to local fisheries activities. Penguins have increased at Punta San Juan, San Juanito Islet and San Gallan Island, all of which are partially protected. Half of the penguins were located in guano bird reserves, primarily at Punta San Juan. Guano bird reserves provide some protection against terrestrial predators and human disturbance; however, periodical guano extraction decreases their breeding success. Most penguin sites were found in inaccessible and marginal areas, which were vulnerable to occasional and unpredictable flooding from ocean swells. The methodology recommended by the Population and Habitat Viability Assessment workshop for a consistent census of penguins in Peru and Chile during the molting period was validated at the Punta San Juan Reserve. Continued monitoring of Humboldt Penguin numbers is recommended in order to more fully understand patterns of fluctuation and to be able to detect changes of conservation concern as early as possible. Collaborative efforts between local authorities and conservation biologists are needed to monitor and protect this vulnerable species."
1057,4232,Have Antarctic toothfish returned to McMurdo Sound?,"A dramatic reduction in catch rates of Antarctic toothfish in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, has led to conclusions that the commercial bottom longline fishery for toothfish in the Ross Sea has drastically altered the toothfish population with cascading effects on the McMurdo Sound ecosystem. However, results from a new monitoring programme for Antarctic toothfish and other top predators carried out in McMurdo Sound in 2014 have shown toothfish catch rate, fish size and fish age similar to those observed prior to 2002. These results suggest that either large and old fish have returned to McMurdo Sound following a temporary environmentally driven absence or that they remained locally present but were not detected in the areas sampled. These findings highlight the importance of continued standardized monitoring for detecting the potential effects of fishing on the Ross Sea ecosystem."
1058,2599,"Revised penguin numbers and distribution for Anvers Island, Antarctica","Estimates of population sizes of penguins breeding at Anvers Island, 1974-1986, are summarized. Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae (approx 28 458 pairs) are concentrated along the S coast of the island, and chinstrap P. antarctica (approx 7179 pairs) and gentoos P. papua (approx 2226 pairs) mostly in the W section. All 3 species breed side by side at 2 localities. The first records for the breeding area of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus and of a vagrant king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus are reported. Adelie and chinstrap populations have remained fairly stable over the last decade despite extensive human activity near some colonies.-from Authors"
1059,2898,"Population sizes, site fidelity and residence patterns of Australian snubfin and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins: Implications for conservation","Very little is known about the ecology of snubfin Orcaella heinsohni and Indo-Pacific humpback; dolphins Sousa chinensis in Australian waters. We used photo-identification data collected; between 1999 and 2002 in Cleveland Bay, northeast Queensland, to estimate; abundance, site fidelity and residence patterns of these species in order to make recommendations; for their effective conservation and management. Our abundance estimates; indicate that less than a hundred individuals of each species inhabit this coastal area. Even; with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates population trends will be extremely; difficult to detect in less than three years unless changes in population size are very; high (>20% p.a.). Though both species are not permanent residents in Cleveland Bay, they; both used the area regularly from year to year following a model of emigration and reimmigration.; Individuals of both species spend periods of days to a month or more in coastal; waters of Cleveland Bay before leaving, and periods of over a month outside the study area; before entering the bay again. Because of their small population sizes and movement patterns,; snubfin and humpback dolphins are particularly vulnerable to local extinction. Our; results illustrate that: (1) detection of population trends should not be a necessary criterion; for enacting conservation measures of both species in this region, and (2) efforts to maintain; viable populations of both species in Cleveland Bay must include management strategies; that integrate anthropogenic activities in surrounding areas."
1060,1525,A proposal for a transnational forest network area for elephants in Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana,"Forest elephants Loxodonta africana cyclotis in Ghana and eastern Côte d'Ivoire live in small isolated populations and number fewer than 1,000 individuals in total. To ensure the long-term survival of these elephants the present forest reserves need to be linked into a network by forest corridors. The potential of such corridors is demonstrated by the active use by elephants in Ghana of forest 'shelterbelts', created in the 1930s. Using information from recent surveys of elephants and vegetation status, and from published information, we propose three possible wildlife corridors in the border region between Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, establishment of which would lead to a transnational forest network area in the Bia and Bossematié areas. Establishing a forest network for forest elephants would require political will, transnational cooperation among forest and wildlife managers, and participation of the local people. "
1061,3674,Demographic and growth analysis of broad snouted caiman (<i>Caiman latirostris</i>) in a disturbed environment in southeastern Brazil,"Crocodilian life history traits exhibit strong size and age dependence, which is determined, ultimately, by how fast individuals grow. Crocodilian population dynamics are dependent on environmental conditions such as local temperatures and hydrology. From February 2010 to October 2011 we conducted monthly spotlight surveys to study a broad-snouted caiman population at the Três Marias Hydro-electric Reservoir, southeast Brazil. A total of 12 spotlight surveys were conducted (17.3 to 48.0 km in length), and animals were captured, measured and marked whenever possible. Data were obtained on population size, sex structure, survival, distribution and growth. The number of caimans counted, including hatchlings, varied from 6 to 78 per survey. Marked individuals showed a growth rate that varied between 0.0 and 0.3 cm*day<sup>-1</sup> SVL, and between -6.0 and 8.0 g*day<sup>-1</sup> body mass. Polyphasic growth was associated with rainfall and water level, which in turn were associated with changes in temperature and diet. The species seems to be resistant to the ecological impacts of damming, an important conservation conclusion considering the large number of hydroelectric dams within the species' range in Brazil."
1062,3324,Social organization and space use of Coyotes in Eastern Canada relative to prey distribution and abundance,"We studied the influence of prey size and abundance on social organization and space use by eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) in 2 areas of Nova Scotia, Canada. Breeding pairs formed the nucleus of coyote social groups, and these often traveled with 1-3 other coyotes during winter. Increased use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was insufficient to explain group size and cohesiveness by eastern coyotes. Winter-traveling group size was similar for family groups using deer (X̄ = 2.6) or snowshoe hares (X̄ = 2.7) as a primary prey in winter. Estimated densities of coyotes in winter was 4.3-13.9 coyotes/100 km2. Coyotes used the same general areas during winter and summer and from year to year. However, territory sizes decreased with increasing densities of deer (partial r2 = 0.21, P = 0.043) and hares (partial r2 = 0.40, P = 0.007). During winter, coyotes used areas of high deer density in proportion to their availability, but in some instances, they used areas that contained few or no deer proportionately more than expected, probably because deep snow and few trails increased vulnerability of deer in these areas. Territoriality seemed to prevent coyotes from concentrating in deer wintering areas and kept the coyote: deer ratio relatively low (<1:25)."
1063,3442,"A 16-year record of summer birds on Truelove Lowland, Devon Island, Northwest Territories, Canada","An annual census of adult birds was conducted on the 43 km2 Truelove Lowland, Devon Island, N.W.T., Canada, in the summers of 1970-73 and 1978-89. Forty-three species were seen during 16 years. Of these, 18 species bred regularly on or immediately adjacent to the lowland and 10 were occasional breeders. In addition 15 species were visitors. The highest annual number for most breeding species was two to three times that of their lowest numbers, but some regular breeding species had far greater extremes. Extensions oft he breeding range of Pacific Loo(Gavia pacifica), Purple Sandpiper (Calidris maritima), Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe), and Water Pipit (Anthus spinoletta) to Devon Island are reported. It is suspectedt hat Hoary Redpolls (Curduelis hornemanni) and Red Knots (Calidris canutus) also nested there once each. A coefficient of detectibilitiys presented for the 16 most frequently seen species. Synchronofulusc tuations in Snow Bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) and Lapland Longspur(Calcarius lapponicus) populations were observed. A possible replacement of Black-bellied Plove(Pluvialis squatarola) by Lesser Golden-Plovers (P. dominica) was detected. An abrupt disappearance of all colonies of breeding ArctiTerns (Sterna paradisea) from the lowland was seen in 1989."
1064,1952,Jaguar Panthera onca population decline in the Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest of Argentina and Brazil,"The Green Corridor of Argentina and Brazil is the largest forest remnant of the Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest. The jaguar population of this region is highly fragmented and reduced. To assess the status of the subpopulation of jaguars of the Green Corridor we conducted four camera-trap surveys in three sites with different levels of protection. At Urugua-í (34 stations, 1,495 trap-days) we recorded one individual (minimum density = 0.12-0.33 per 100 km2). At Yabotí Biosphere Reserve (42 stations, 1,871 trap-days) we recorded two individuals (minimum density = 0.11-0.25 per 100 km2). At Iguazú National Park we conducted two surveys. In 2004 (39 stations, 1,839 trap-days) we recorded four adult individuals, estimating a density of between 0.49 ± 0.16 and 1.07 ± 0.33 per 100 km2. In 2006, we increased the area sampled (47 stations, 2,059 trap-days) and recorded 11 adult individuals, estimating a density of 0.93 ± 0.2 to 1.74 ± 0.34 per 100 km2. These density estimates are the lowest recorded for the species. Estimates for Iguazú are between 2-7.5 times lower than those reported in the early 1990s. This population decline probably results from the interaction of several factors, including lack of prey as a result of poaching and persecution. We estimate that there is currently a population of 25-53 adult jaguars in the Green Corridor. In spite of having sufficient potential habitat available this population is threatened and urgent conservation action is required. "
1065,4211,Protection affects the abundance and activity patterns of Pumas in the Atlantic Forest,"Knowing the factors that affect the abundance and activity patterns of pumas (Puma concolor) in South; American forests may help in their conservation. Using camera traps, we conducted 4 surveys in 3 areas with; different levels of protection against poaching and logging within the biggest continuous fragment of the Upper; Parana Atlantic Forest. We used capturemarkrecapture population models to estimate the density of pumas; for each area. The core area of Iguazu´ National Park, with low poaching pressure and no logging for .60 years,; had the highest density of pumas (between 1.55 and 2.89 individuals/100 km2). Yabot?´ Biosphere Reserve, an; area with the highest poaching and logging pressure, showed the lowest density (between 0.3 and 0.74; individuals/100 km2). Areas with intermediate levels of poaching and logging pressure had densities between; 0.66 and 2.19 individuals/100 km2. Puma activity peaked during the 1st hours of morning in the most protected; area, but became more crepuscular and nocturnal in areas with less protection. The lower abundance of pumas; in the more degraded areas may be related to lower prey abundance. Differences in activity patterns of pumas; among areas with different poaching pressures may be a direct response to poaching or to changes in the; availability and activity patterns of primary prey. Conservation efforts should focus on decreasing poaching and; logging pressures within protected areas to benefit pumas and other endangered species in the Atlantic Forest."
1066,3814,"Bats of St. Kitts (St. Christopher), northern Lesser Antilles, with comments regarding capture rates of neotropical bats","Only four species of bats have been previously reported from the Antillean island of St. Kitts-Noctilio leporinus, Artibeus jamaicensis, Molossus molossus, and Tadarida brasiliensis. Our field research reported herein adds three species to this list-Monophyllus plethodon, Ardops nichollsi, and Brachyphylla cavernarum. These efforts included mist netting in a variety of foraging habitats and extensive surveys of natural and anthropogenic roost sites. We discuss the difficulty in accurately reporting mist-netting effort and capture rates. The average rate of fruit bat captures during 2001 on St. Kitts (1.11 bats per net-night - BNN) falls towards the lower end of the range (0.65-2.47 BNN) reported from nearby islands in the northern Lesser Antilles and the lower end of the range (2.20-5.93 BNN) reported for mainland populations of neotropical fruit bats. We discuss possible causes of these decreased population levels, such as the impact of recent hurricanes and competition from the large population of vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus sabaeus) found on St. Kitts."
1067,1782,Population dynamics of two small pelagic fish in the central-south area off Chile: delayed density-dependence and biological interaction,"It is widely believed that environmental variability is the main cause for fluctuations in commercially exploited small pelagic fish populations around the world. Nevertheless, density-dependent factors also can drive population dynamics. In this paper, we analyzed thirteen years of a relative abundance index of two clupeoids fish populations coexisting in the central-south area off Chile, namely the common sardine, Strangomera bentincki, and anchovy, Engraulis ringens. We applied the classical diagnostic tools of time series analysis to the observed time-series. Also, the realized per capita population growth rate was studied with the aim of detecting the feedback structure that is characterizing the population dynamics of the two species. The analysis suggests that population fluctuations of the two species have an important density-dependent component, displaying first-order (direct density-dependent) and second-order (delayed density-dependent) simultaneously. The density-dependent component explained 70.5 and 55.6 % of the realized per capita population growth rate of common sardine and anchovy, respectively. The deterministic skeleton model showed an asymptotic convergence to equilibrium density. In presence of a stochastic environment, fluctuations were reproduced for the species showing a component of fluctuation with a period of 4 year. The intrinsic dynamics of each species is typical of interacting species resulting from trophic interactions. It is postulated that the second-order dynamics of S. bentincki and E. ringens in central-south Chile, may be the result from interactions with a specialist predator (the fishing fleet), interacting with exogenous environmental factors. "
1068,4004,Combining survey methods to estimate abundance and transience of migratory birds among tropical nonbreeding habitats,"Estimating population abundance for territorial species is challenging because individuals often differ in behavior (e.g.,; transience, multiterritoriality), and thus in detectability. How well prevailing methods detect and quantify individuals; using multiple strategies is rarely addressed. In our effort to efficiently quantify avian abundance and transience; among diverse nonbreeding habitats, we combined unmarked (distance sampling) with traditional marked (territory; mapping) survey methods using a migratory passerine, the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), wintering in 3; habitats in Jamaica from 2010 to 2012. We predicted that the unmarked survey method would detect not only all; known (marked) territorial individuals, but also individuals that were transient or nonterritorial in the same habitats.; Comparisons of abundance estimates generated by our best distance sampling (unmarked) model with territory; mapping data identified high proportions of transient individuals (up to 50%) in 2 habitats, coastal dry scrub and; mangrove, and virtually none in the third habitat, higher-elevation wet limestone forest. Documenting so many; nonterritorial individuals, disproportionately weighted toward females and yearlings, in some habitatyear; combinations prompts questions of what conditions favor transience and what role these individuals play in; population processes. Our results illustrate how unmarked and marked survey methods can be used jointly to establish; the number and identity of transients from neighboring areas. The unmarked survey method was sufficient for; estimating population size among different habitats, but marked survey methods were necessary to identify and; quantify transient individuals. Combined, these methods provide a powerful tool for assessing the range and variation; of space-use strategies deployed by nonbreeding individuals."
1069,1781,"Perspectives on ornamental fisheries in the upper Paraná River floodplain, Brazil","South America has remarkable fish diversity, with many species regarded as ornamentals. Each year, ornamental fishes worth billions of dollars are traded worldwide. In Brazil, in spite of its large geographic area and many different drainage basins, the trade is restricted to the Amazon region. Considering that the ornamental potential is unknown in other basins, this work aimed to assess the potential in the last remaining floodplain of the upper Paraná River basin. Fish collections associated with the PELD-CNPq project (Site 6) from 2000 and 2001 were analyzed. Fishes were collected with gill nets and beach seines in lagoons, channels and rivers of the floodplain. To evaluate the ornamental potential, this analysis categorized all taxa recorded as: (i) ornamental, (ii) potentially ornamental, (iii) lawful, and (iv) suggested lawful. A total of 101 taxa were captured, with 40.6% cited as ornamental in the literature and an additional 42.6% are considered as potentially ornamental. Of these taxa, Brazilian legislation restricts the trade to only 10 species, mainly small Characiformes, which are abundant in many lagoons and already well known in the market. CPUE and density catches differed among environments, with higher values for ornamental and lawful taxa observed in lagoons. Some isolated lagoons showed extremely high lawful fish densities (over 3000 ind./100 m2). Considering our results, the upper Paraná River floodplain has great potential for ornamental fisheries. The ornamental fishery could be a new economic alternative to help alleviate the social poverty found in many cities along the Paraná River. Due to the proximity of the floodplain to larger cities such as Maringá and Paranavaí, establishment of ornamental trade activities will demand less capital and at the same time reduce problems associated with transport, aviamento and fish mortality. Species richness and captures (density and CPUE) indicated an existing ornamental potential in this floodplain, but only future studies will assure if stocks can endure pressures of such a selective fishery.

1070,2944,"Density, climate and varying return points: an analysis of long-term population fluctuations in the threatened European tree frog","Experimental research has identified many putative agents of amphibian decline, yet the population-level consequences of these agents remain unknown, owing to lack of information on compensatory density dependence in natural populations. Here, we investigate the relative importance of intrinsic (density-dependent) and extrinsic (climatic) factors impacting the dynamics of a tree frog (Hyla arborea) population over 22 years. A combination of log-linear density dependence and rainfall (with a 2-year time lag corresponding to development time) explain 75% of the variance in the rate of increase. Such fluctuations around a variable return point might be responsible for the seemingly erratic demography and disequilibrium dynamics of many amphibian populations. "
1071,2770,Decomposing variation in population growth into contributions from environment and phenotypes in an age-structured population,"Evaluating the relative importance of ecological drivers responsible for natural population fluctuations in size is challenging. Longitudinal studies where most individuals are monitored from birth to death and where environmental conditions are known provide a valuable resource to characterize complex ecological interactions.We used a recently developed approach to decompose the observed fluctuation in population growth of the red deer population on the Isle of Rum into contributions from climate, density and their interaction and to quantify their relative importance. We also quantified the contribution of individual covariates, including phenotypic and life-history traits, to population growth. Fluctuations in composition in age and sex classes ((st)age structure) of the population contributed substantially to the population dynamics. Density, climate, birth weight and reproductive status contributed less and approximately equally to the population growth. Our results support the contention that fluctuations in the population's (st)age structure have important consequences for population dynamics and underline the importance of including information on population composition to understand the effect of human-driven changes on population performance of long-lived species. "
1072,4483,Evaluating abundance trends of iconic species using local ecological knowledge,"Abundance is commonly used to assess the status of wildlife populations and their responses to changes in management frameworks. Monitoring abundance trends often requires long-term data collection programs, which are not always carried out. One alternative to scientific surveys is to utilize the local ecological knowledge (LEK), from people in continuous interactions with the environment. We developed a semi-quantitative approach to assess shark population trends by using the LEK of non-extractive resource users. We carried out structured interviews with dive guides regarding the abundance trends of six shark species in the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) across decades since the 1980s. Based on dive guides’ LEK, we developed a virtual abundance change (VAC) model to assess the changes in abundance across decades. Our VAC analysis showed a 50% decline in hammerhead sharks and 30% decline in whitetip reef sharks. Silky sharks and Galapagos sharks were perceived to suffer an initial decline by 25% and 30% then stabilized. Whale shark abundance did not appear to have changed. Finally, blacktip sharks showed an apparent recovery after a decline by 25%. Furthermore, our VAC results were comparatively similar to empirical datasets from the GMR and neighboring protected areas of the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Our study highlights the value of LEK in assessing the state of marine resources in data-limited management regions. Our VAC method offers an alternative approach by which LEK can provide valuable insights into the historical trends of species abundance."
1073,3623,Population regulation in a Neotropical seasonal wetland fish,"Density-dependent regulation is a necessary process for the long-term persistence of populations. Nevertheless, ecologists still debate whether floodplain fish populations are subject to density-dependent dynamics or mostly regulated by the density-independent seasonal flooding. We surveyed Jewel tetra (Hyphessonbrycon eques) populations during 4 years in the floodplain lagoons of the Cuiabá River (Brazil) in order to determine if recruitment, growth, and survival are subject to density-dependent effects. We showed that population dynamics of this species are influenced by the seasonal drought, which affects the various life stages of the cohort in different ways. The flood had positive effects on the strength of recruitment, and indirectly affected the probability of survival of recruits during the following dry season as well as on the extinction probability of local populations. Additionally, by facilitating the dispersal of pre-larvae and juvenile recruits, it enables the re-establishment of locally extinct populations during the preceding dry season. Therefore, flooding is essential for the persistence of the species at the regional scale. On the other hand, the limiting conditions during the dry season cause high mortality rates among juveniles. More importantly, the mortality during the dry season is density-dependent and causes changes in population size structure and extinction of local populations, which will affect recruitment in the following year. Our results change the traditional belief that flood alone control population dynamics of fish dwelling in floodplains of larger rivers but a longer survey is required to better understand the effects of drought."
1074,1364,Demographic Forecasting in Koala Conservation,"The koala currently needs conservation intervention. There is clear evidence of decline in many populations, but the existence of other stable or expanding populations offers the possibility of a variety of creative solutions to their conservation problems. The 1998 National Koala Conservation Strategy emphasizes the need to obtain demographic information and to use this information to assess management options for koalas. We need accurate diagnoses of the status of koala populations and forecasts of their demography future with and without particular management actions. In a qualitative fashion, this process has been undertaken many times on a local and national scale. Quantitative demographic forecasting tools are increasingly available and koala management could benefit from their application both at the scale of individual populations and more broadly. There is already a considerable body of suitable data on the dispersal, effects of normal and catastrophic environmental variation on reproduction and survival and on the effects of habitat change. Demographic forecasting, however, is hampered because the full suite of information is rarely available from a single population. In two Queensland populations, retrospective population viability analyses provided forecasts that were in agreement with observed population trends. Work is needed to determine whether data from one population can be applied to other populations. Models can then be developed to make projections at a multipopulation level on the basis of local population dynamics and dispersal. Certain koala populations, because of their long history of study, offer the opportunity to test demographic models retrospectively. These tests will not only aid in fine-tuning the models for koala biology and data but will also assist with the more general process of validating the models."
1075,661,"Biology of a seahorse species, Hippocampus comes in the central Philippines","Based on 16 months of field observations on tagged seahorses Hippocampus comes in the Philippines, adults were found to be nocturnal, to maintain small home ranges, and to live mostly among corals. Prolonged pair associations suggested that H. comes, like many other seahorse species, were probably monogamous, a conclusion consistent with their low density and sparse distribution. Site and mate fidelity suggest that H. comes populations may fare poorly under current high levels of exploitation. "
1076,3793,Population density of Geoffroy's cat in scrublands of central Argentina,"We studied the density of a Geoffroy's cat Leopardus geoffroyi population in a semiarid scrubland of Argentina, by comparing density estimates obtained during camera-trapping surveys in a national park and in nearby cattle ranches in 2006 and 20072008. Overall, we obtained 247 pictures of Geoffroy's cats. The density (mean ±se) of the species at the park ranged from 1.2 ± 0.3 to 2.9 ± 1.4 individuals km?2, depending on the buffer applied, whereas density estimates at ranches were on average 32% lower. Only 11% of the Geoffroy's cats identified in 2006 could still be detected in the area 2 years later, indicating that there was a high turnover of individuals in this population. The sex ratio (M:F) estimated during both surveys at the park was 1:1.4, whereas at the ranches it was 1:0.8. The capture success of sympatric pampas cats Leopardus colocolo and jaguarundis Puma yagouaroundi was <0.3 records per 100 trap-days, and no evidence of these species was found in the ranches. Geoffroy's cats seem to be tolerant to some degree of habitat alteration produced by livestock management, and the numerical response of this species in ranches could be largely the result of human persecution and the effects of livestock management on the habitat structure and prey base."
1077,3921,Numerical and spatial response of Geoffroy's car (Oncifelis geoffroyi) to prey decline in Argentina,"We examined the numerical and spatial responses of Geoffroys cats (Oncifelis geoffroyi) to a prey decline in central Argentina between April 2002 and November 2003. The 2nd year of the study coincided with a severe drought. Relative abundance of brown hares (Lepus europaeus) declined from 5.6 individuals/10 km during the predrought period to about 0.6 individuals/10 km during the drought. Small-rodent biomass also showed the lowest level for the study area during the drought of 20022003 (134.5 g/ha). During the predrought and drought periods, 3 male and 1 female, and 1 male and 9 female Geoffroys cats, respectively, were radiotagged and monitored. Home ranges for males of the predrought period averaged 202.8 ha 6 156.8 SD and that of the single female was 27.3 ha. During the drought period, 4 females occupied an average home range of 254.9 6 254.1 ha, and the home-range size of the single predrought female increased by a factor of 2. No obvious change in mean daily distance traveled between the 2 periods was observed. Geoffroys cats predominantly used habitats of dense cover during the predrought period, but they became more habitat generalists during the drought. Recruitment of juveniles was only recorded during the predrought period, and all monitored Geoffroys cats dispersed or died of starvation after the prey decline. Consequently, density of Geoffroys cats dropped from 2.9 individuals/10 km2 before the drought to 0.3 individuals/10 km2, probably because of food scarcity. This is the 1st study to examine the spatial ecology of a small wild cat species under nutritional (energetic) stress in South America."
1078,2426,Status of American coot Fulica americana (Gruiformes: Rallidae) wintering in Mexico,"We determined population trends and important sites for American coot (Fulica americana) wintering in Mexico, for which population information in the country is practically inexistent. The long-term (1960-2000) distribution of the population wintering in the country was: Gulf of Mexico coast (68%), upper Pacific coast (20%), central highlands (7%), northern highlands (3%), lower Pacific coast (2%). The short-term (1991-2000) distribution was 53%, 30%, 8%, 5% and 3%, respectively. Numbers decreased from 1981 until 1997, but no significant long-term or short-term linear trends were detected in the overall national population. The national short-term average of around 210,000 American coot was 52% below (P < 0.05) the long-term average of around 450,000. In the Gulf of Mexico coast, a significant decline was detected (-2.4% per year, P < 0.05). Other regions showed no significant trends. American coots are widespread throughout the country, but large concentrations occur only on a few locations. During 1991-2000, American coot were recorded in 76% of the count sites, but six sites alone held 71% of the national total (Tamesi and Panuco river deltas 17.8%, Ensenada Pabellon 15.6%, Topolobampo 9.1%, Campeche-Yucatan lagoons 17.8%, Tabasco lagoons 6.7%, Laguna Madre 3.8%). The former three sites qualify as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, by having on average more than 20,000 American coot. The cause for decreasing numbers, especially in the Gulf Coast, the extent of resident populations, and the role of the species as an indicator of wetland health should be subject to further investigation."
1079,701,"Wildfowl population trends in Mexico, 1961-2000: a basis for conservation planning","We analysed population trends of 24 wildfowl species in Mexico. Wildfowl numbers peaked during the early 1980s; lowest counts were recorded in 1997. Total wildfowl numbers (all species combined) and duck numbers (duck species combined) showed significant short-term (1981-2000) declines, while geese (goose species combined) showed a significant long-term (1961-2000) increase. Six wildfowl species suffered significant long-term declines, while four showed increases. During 1981-2000, 11 species declined, but none had significant increases. Redhead (Aythya americana), Mexican duck (Anas diazi), northern pintail (A. acuta) and black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) should be given high conservation priority because of the high proportions of their North American populations in Mexico. Declining numbers of the later two species should trigger further investigation into the possibility of assigning them legal protection status. Other species with apparent declines in numbers should also be more closely monitored. For setting hunting limits in the country, the population status of each species should be accounted for, as well as the condition of breeding populations the previous spring. Other species with poor data or combined counts should be targeted for basic population studies. We suggest that the mid-winter counts be expanded to cover non-surveyed areas and conducted every year to more precisely detect wildfowl population change. Integrated to a site-selection analysis, the information presented here can provide the basis for a wildfowl conservation strategy in Mexico. "
1080,3826,Effects of nature-based tourism and environmental drivers on the demography of a small dolphin population,"Many marine top predators are experiencing significant declines due to anthropogenic impacts, and therefore reliable monitoring is essential to understand their population dynamics.Weused Pollock's robust design capturerecapture modelling to assess the influence of oceanographic variables, artisanal fisheries and human disturbance on several demographic parameters (abundance, temporary emigration and survival) of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), using long-term data on marked individuals from East Africa. Photoidentification data was collected over 551 boat-based surveys between 2006 and 2009, with 137 individuals identified. Our best fitting model indicated that exposure to tourism (represented by the number of tourist boats) increased the probability of dolphins seasonally emigrating from the study area. The return rate of temporary emigrants was negatively linked to the seasonal sea surface temperature, probably associated with food availability. That model supported the existence of heterogeneity in annual local survival estimates, with transient dolphins showing a lower value than resident individuals (0.78 and 0.98, respectively). Furthermore, abundance estimates showed a small population size ranging from 19 individuals (95% CI: 1133) to a maximum of 104 dolphins (95% CI: 78139). This small population, together with their high site fidelity and coastal distribution, might be particularly vulnerable to human disturbances. This study highlights the influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors on dolphin demography and population dynamics and the need to integrate these drivers to provide robust evidences for conservation stakeholders in an adaptive management framework."
1081,4407,Combined bottom-up and top-down pressures drive catastrophic population declines of Arctic skuas in Scotland," Understanding drivers of population change is critical for effective species conservation. In the northeast Atlantic Ocean, recent changes amongst seabird communities are linked to human and climate change impacts on food webs. Many species have declined severely, with food shortages, and increased predation reducing productivity. Arctic skua Stercorarius parasiticus, a kleptoparasite of other seabirds, is one such species. The aim of the study was to determine relative effects of bottom-up and top-down pressures on Arctic skuas across multiple colonies in a rapidly declining national population. Long-term monitoring data were used to quantify changes in population size and productivity of Arctic skuas, their hosts (black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, common guillemot Uria aalge, Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica, Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea) and an apex predator (great skua Stercorarius skua) over 24 years (19922015) in Scotland. We used digital mapping and statistical models to determine relative effects of bottom-up (host productivity) and top-down (great skua density) pressures on Arctic skuas across 33 colonies, and assess variation between three colony types classified by host abundance. Arctic skuas declined by 81% and their hosts by 42%92%, whereas at most colonies great skuas increased. Annual productivity declined in Arctic skuas and their hosts, and reduced Arctic skua breeding success was a driver of the species population decline. Arctic skua productivity was positively associated with annual breeding success of hosts and negatively with great skua density. Intercolony variation suggested Arctic skua trends and productivity were most sensitive to top-down pressures at smaller colonies of host species where great skuas had increased most, whereas bottom-up pressures dominated at large colonies of host species. Scotland's Arctic skua population is declining rapidly, with bottom-up and top-down pressures simultaneously reducing breeding success to unsustainably low levels. Marine food web alterations, strongly influenced by fisheries management and climate change, are driving the decline, and this study demonstrates severe vulnerability of seabirds to rapid change in human-modified ecosystems. Potential but untested conservation solutions for Arctic skuas include marine protected areas, supplementary feeding within colonies and management of great skuas."
1082,2477,A dispersal rate in a wisent population of Bieszczady Mountains,"In the western subpopulation of wisents inhabiting Bieszczady Mountains, analysed; was a tendency for the extension of a home range to the north. In studied period (20012008); the northern boundary of the home range was annually expanding on average by 2.6 km, which; is much faster comparing to first 20 years after the establishment of this population (0.7 km per; year). The total home range area of this subpopulation (between 2001  2008), grew up from; about 140 to over 300 km2. This subpopulation is not restricted by habitat limits, and potential; migration routes to the west and east are not blocked by any significant natural or man-made; barriers. Wisents migrating north, encounter increasingly altered habitats and frequent presence; of people. Probable explanation for such tendency of range extension to the north is the; occurrence of favourable climatic conditions in valleys situated at low elevations, and high; abundance of brambles in pine stands, established at former agricultural area."
1083,3050,"Aggregations of Plectropomus areolatus and Epinephelus fuscoguttatus (groupers, Serranidae) in the Komodo National Park, Indonesia: monitoring and implications for management","We identify fishery management implications from a long-term monitoring program focusing on spawning; aggregations of high valued reef fish in Komodo National Park (KNP), Eastern Indonesia. Management; objectives of KNP are not only to protect biodiversity, but also to conserve spawning stocks of high-valued; commercial species for the replenishment of surrounding fishing grounds. We monitored two sites twice; monthly over five years for two species of grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus and Plectropomus areolatus.; One site had an aggregation of both E. fuscoguttatus and P. areolatus, whereas the other site contained an; aggregation of P. areolatus only. Over the five years monitoring period, aggregations typically formed; during each full moon between September and February. Additionally, P. areolatus occasionally aggregated; during new moons between April and July. We observed spawning only once, but because formation; of aggregations were correlated to a higher incidence of behavior and signs indicative of reproduction and; because most fish present were adults, it is likely that the formation of aggregations was associated with; spawning. Over the five years monitoring period there was a reduction in mean fish size of up to 8 cm for P.; areolatus, and a reduction in numbers of aggregating E. fuscoguttatus. Despite limited protection initiated; in 2001, both sites are still heavily fished by local artisanal fishers. Because the observed reductions in size; and in numbers could be caused by fishing pressure, managers should follow the precautionary principle by; putting additional protective management in place. Since both species are relatively long-lived, at least five; years of continued monitoring may be necessary to determine the outcome of management intervention.; The variability in timing of aggregation in respect to season and moon phase in P. areolatus indicates that; long-term monitoring must cover the entire year and both moon phases."
1084,4161,Pelagic shark bycatch in the tuna- and swordfish-directed longline fishery off southern Africa,"The capture of pelagic sharks as bycatch of the South African pelagic longline fleet targeting tuna Thunnus spp. and swordfish Xiphias gladius was investigated during the period 1998-2005. In all, 26 species were caught, of which six are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as Vulnerable and one (scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini) as Endangered. Blue shark Prionace glauca and short-finned mako Isurus oxyrinchus were the most commonly caught species (69.2% and 17.2% respectively). Generalised linear models explained 70.4% of blue shark and 22.2% of short-finned mako bycatch patterns and showed that vessel name was the most important explana- tory variable. Other significant explanatory variables included month, year, area, bathymetry, bait type, moon phase and time of set. South African-flagged, swordfish-directed vessels caught more sharks (11.7 blue sharks and 1.4 short-finned mako sharks per 1 000 hooks) than Asian-flagged, tuna-directed vessels (1.8 blue sharks and 0.9 short-finned mako per 1 000 hooks). The catch per unit effort of blue sharks and short-finned mako sharks started to decrease from 2001 and 2000 respectively. This was accompanied by a decrease in average length for both species over the period 2002-2007. Three techniques for extrapolating total shark mortality were investigated. Simple extrapolation yielded an estimate of 73 500 sharks per year; if vessel flag was taken into account, the estimate decreased to 39 200 sharks per year and to 43 100 sharks if vessel flag and area (5° grid cells) were taken into account.

1085,4120,"Abundance and Size Structure of Shortnose Sturgeon in the Altamaha River, Georgia","Endangered Shortnose Sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum inhabit large tidal rivers along the Atlantic coastline of NorthAmerica, ranging from the St. John River, Canada, southward to the St. Johns River, Florida. Currently, long-term assessments of the abundance and age structure of southern populations are completely lacking. To address this information gap, we assessed recent changes in Shortnose Sturgeon abundance and age structure by sampling with anchored entanglement gear in the AltamahaRiver, Georgia, during summer in 2004–2010. To estimate abundance, we used the Huggins closed-capture model in Program MARK. We assessed size structure by interpreting the first, second, and third quartiles of the FL of individuals captured during each year. In total, we captured 1,737 Shortnose Sturgeon (72 recaptures). Total estimated abundance was variable, ranging from 1,206 individuals (95% lognormal confidence interval [CI] = 566–2,759) in 2009 to 5,551 individuals (95% CI = 2,804–11,304) in 2006. Much of the annual variation in totalabundance was attributable to wide variations in juvenile abundance, which ranged from a low of 62 individuals (95% CI = 24–181) in 2009 to a high of 3,467 individuals (95% CI = 1,744–7,095) in 2006. Annual shifts in size structure were indicative of rapid population turnover, probably resulting froma combination of mortality and permanent emigration. Although the Altamaha River Shortnose Sturgeon population shares several characteristics with northern populations (e.g., variable juvenile abundance and stable adult abundance), our results suggest that southern populations are more susceptible to decline because of their accelerated life cycle and inherently lower abundances.

1086,3431,Surveying bats for conservation: the status of cave-dwelling bats on Curaçao from 1993 to 2003,"In view of their ecological importance and the abundance of threats on a developing Caribbean island, we surveyed the bats of Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles, and examined changes in the populations of seven threatened species over a decade, using previously published data as a baseline for comparison. The most important caves for bats (in terms of species representation and reproduction) were visited yearly, and monthly in 2001. Noctilio leporinus still occurs on the island, but does not appear to be numerous (six observed in 2003). We captured Myotis nesopolus nesopolus, but its roosting sites remain unknown. Leptonycteris curasoae curasoae numbers varied greatly, even within a year, and it may travel to and from other islands and Venezuela. Overall, however, the population of this species on Curaçao seems to be declining (1000 in 1993 and 625 in 2003); the disappearance of this pollinator could have severe consequences for the Curaçao ecosystem. Mormoops megalophylla intermedia is declining as well; in 2003, we counted 403 individuals including 75 pups, from 500 to 600 adults in the 10 previous years, representing a 25-30% decline in 1 year. We estimated the population of Natalus tumidirostris to be 890 in 2003. We also found a group of 60 Pteronotus davyi in Kueba di Ratón in 2003. Glossophaga longirostris elongata (1417 individuals counted) is the only species for which our data indicate relative stability over 10 years; L. curasoae and Mor. megalophylla are declining and other species must be monitored closely. Most caves are disturbed; four major caves require attention for the conservation of the most fragile species. Without immediate attention, Mor. megalophylla, in particular, risks imminent extinction. Despite problems associated with bat counts on Curaçao, it is clear that regular surveys are crucial to understand bat populations and their fluctuations in caves, and to allow management responses to declines, particularly for areas undergoing rapid urbanization.

1087,2465,Population density and small-scale variation in habitat quality affect phenotypic quality in roe deer,"We tested for fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality in a roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) population in the Chizé reserve located in western France by measuring spatial variation in the availability and plant nitrogen content of principal and preferred plant species. There were significant differences in habitat quality within the reserve: the principal food plants in spring and summer occurred more frequently in the oak woodland in the north than in the beech woodland in the south of the reserve. Within species, plants in the north had higher nitrogen contents than in the south. There was a positive spatial covariation between habitat quality, local density and fawn body weight: animal densities and fawn body weights were highest in the north, the best habitat (i.e. the habitat with more abundant food of higher quality). These results differ from those recently obtained on red deer (Cervus elaphus). We suggest that spatial organization and foraging behaviour must be accounted for when considering the effect of habitat quality on individual fitness of ungulates."
1088,3122,Rapid population growth of Great Skuas Catharacta skua at St Kilda: implications for management and conservation,"The St Kilda archipelago is a World Heritage Site holding internationally important populations of a number of seabird species. Great Skuas first bred at St Kilda in 1963, and numbers there rose steadily until 1990. Since then, a rapid expansion has occurred, with the population size increasing on Hirta, the main island in the archipelago, at a rate of 22.1% per annum between 1994 and 1997. In total, 233 pairs were occupying territories at St Kilda in 1997. A simple model suggests that as many as 50% of the birds recruited to Hirta between 1994 and 1997 were immigrants from other colonies. Comparison of breeding data collected in different areas gave no indication that the higher nest density resulting from the recent influx was having any detrimental effect on annual productivity and it seems likely that Great Skuas will continue to increase, at least in the near future. Given the importance of seabird prey in the diet of Great Skuas at St Kilda, the continued expansion in numbers of this species gives some cause for concern. However, because immigration plays a large role in the population dynamics of Great Skuas at this site, any attempts to limit population growth by small-scale culling of adults or reduction of reproductive output is unlikely to succeed, and might result in a decline in recruitment at other colonies of this rare and vulnerable species. "
1089,510,The influence of territory density on the vulnerability of arctic skuas Stercorarius parasiticus to predation.,"Foula (Shetland) holds one of the largest and densest Arctic skua Stercorarius parasiticus colonies in the UK and the largest colony of great skuas Catharacta skua in the world. The distribution of Arctic skua territories on Foula changed markedly between 1976 and 1994, with a disproportionately large decline occurring in most of the northern half of the island. Examination of breeding data collected in recent years (1992-1994) found no effect of Arctic skua breeding density on laying date, breeding synchrony, clutch volume or fledging success. However, hatching success and short-term post-fledging survival were considerably better in high-density areas where Arctic skuas seem able to mount a stronger defence against great skua predation. This was not without some associated costs, since a negative correlation existed between chick growth and the number of near neighbours in 2 out of 3 years. A simple model of local fluctuations in numbers during the early mid-1980s suggested that spatial variation in the mortality or emigration rate of established adults may have been responsible for the changes in distribution, probably as a result of pressure from great skuas. In addition, low density areas with poorer overall productivity seem to have attracted few new Arctic skua recruits. Similar density-dependent processes may have been responsible for long-term declines and changes in distribution of Arctic skuas at other colonies which have been attributed circumstantially to predation by great skuas. This study, therefore, provides key data on the influence of breeding density on vulnerability of Arctic skuas to predation. This is particularly relevant in the light of recent concern that the impact of great skua predation on other seabirds, including Arctic skuas, is unacceptably high in Shetland, and that some degree of population management should be considered."
1090,1523,Population Trends and the Koala Conservation Debate,"A critical issue affecting the long-term management of koalas is their perceived conservation status. Koalas still occur in many areas throughout their historical range, but numbers of animals are estimated to vary from < 100,000 to at least one order of magnitude higher. Complex factors limit free-ranging koala populations, including food tree preferences, history of disturbance, and Chlamydia infection, all of which make longer-term population trends of many populations difficult to predict. Lack of consensus regarding the size and viability of remaining populations and regarding the extent of and reasons for decline, or overabundance in some instances, hinders the conservation task. A reappraisal of population trends suggests that, notwithstanding localized management issues in Victoria and South Australia, overall the species is 'vulnerable' on the basis of current World Conservation Union criteria. Recommendations for more effective conservation of koalas include (1) acknowledging the legitimacy of differing perspectives, (2) recognizing the uncertainty and assumptions inherent in population estimates and trends, (3) applying greater rigor and developing better standards for monitoring population trends, and (4) being cautious in assigning conservation status to national, state, and regional populations."
1091,3603,"The effects of protection measures on fish assemblage in the Plemmirio marine reserve (Central Mediterranean Sea, Italy): a first assessment 5 years after its establishment","This 2-year study was aimed to investigate the early effects of protection measures on fish assemblage in the Plemmirio marine reserve and to evaluate its level of enforcement. Sampling was carried out by means of underwater visual census techniques in four sampling sites within the reserve boundaries and eight outside the reserve. Results showed significant inside/outside differences in the multivariate abundance of fish assemblage. These results were confirmed and exemplified by significant univariate differences between; locations for total abundance, Species Richness and diversity of the fish assemblage; values of these metrics were higher inside the reserve than outside. Small fish size and species of low and medium fishing value did not display significant inside/outside differences in abundances whereas medium, large size fish and high value species showed abundances significantly higher inside the marine reserve. Protection effects were particularly evident for large specimens of high fishing value, most of which were exclusively found inside the reserve (Diplodus puntazzo, Epinephelus costae, Mycteroperca rubra, Scorpaena scrofa, Spondyliosoma cantharus, Sciaena umbra and Epinephelus marginatus). The present study provides evidence of a reserve effect on fish populations after only five years since its establishment. This is an extraordinary result likely due to the high level of enforcement observed inside the Plemmirio MPA."
1092,2490,"Monitoring important coastal sites for bottlenose dolphin in Cardigan Bay, UK","From 19942007 Ceredigion County Council and a network of shore-based, volunteer observers monitored levels of boat traffic and the occurrence of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus at seven sites on the coast of Cardigan Bay, Wales. We report high rates of site use and site occupancy by this species during the summer: at Mwnt for example, dolphins were recorded in >80% of 2 hours' observation periods; and at New Quay Harbour dolphins were present in >30% of all 15-minute intervals. At Mwnt and Aberporth there was a significant annual trend for increasing sighting rates; at Ynys Lochtyn a positive trend was only marginally non-significant; at New Quay Bird's Rock the trend was ambiguous but appeared stable over the seven most recent years. Although trends in site use may not reflect population trends in the wider region, these data were consistent with recent abundance estimates that indicate that the number of bottlenose dolphins using Cardigan Bay is stable or slightly increasing. Average group size at our study sites was small (<3 animals), which contrasts with observations of larger schools of the same population elsewhere in their range. The predominant behaviour in coastal Cardigan Bay is demersal foraging, often by solitary animals in shallow near-shore habitats. There was evidence that boat traffic suppressed site use by dolphins at New Quay Harbour, the busiest monitoring site: sighting rates fell when high numbers of boats were present and sighting rates were higher in 2007 than in previous years, when boat use was reduced due to poor weather during the main tourist season. This study demonstrates that networks of volunteer observers can provide a cost-effective, non-invasive means of gathering data on marine mammals for the purposes of coastal zone management. "
1093,1710,Effects of Tropical Cyclonic Storms on Flying Fox Populations on the South Pacific Islands of Samoa,"The South Pacific islands of Samoa have two extant flying fox species, Pteropus samoensis and P. tonganus. Following two severe cyclonic storms, we examined their differential behavioral responses and evaluated the effectiveness of recently established reserves in providing refugia. Although the cyclones disrupted activity patterns and foraging behavior for both species, comparisons with pre-storm data suggested that the more common, widely distributed P. tonganus experienced more severe population declines than the endemic P. samoensis. This differential mortality could be explained by a combination of ecological and behavioral factors. P. tonganus had a greater tendency to enter villages to feed on fallen cultivated fruits, making it more vulnerable to human hunting and predation by domestic animals. In addition, P. samoensis appeared to use survival strategies not observed in P. tonganus. Leaves, which were far more available than flowers or fruits in the immediate post-storm period, comprised a major part of the post-storm diet of P. samoensis. This species also fed on the fleshy bracts of a storm-resistant native liana, (Freycinetia reineckei). In contrast, a seasonally important food of P. tonganus is nectar from the delicate flowers of Syzygium inophylloides (asi), a canopy tree that is very vulnerable to wind damage and has become increasing scarce with the clearing of lowland forest. Rainforest reserves, established prior to the storms, served as adequate refugia for local P. samoensis populations, which appeared to feed relatively close to their roosts, primarily in native forest, but did not protect P. tonganus populations, which traveled outside reserves to forage in areas lacking hunting bans. Although wind damage was patchy and not consistent between storms, areas of high topographic complexity (e.g., volcanic cones and deep valleys) were the most likely to retain areas with some foliage and should be given priority in the design of future reserves."
1094,1729,"Earlier Nesting Contributes to Shorter Nesting Seasons for the Loggerhead Seaturtle, Caretta caretta","Evidence is mounting that warming air and sea temperatures are affecting nesting patterns in oviparous species by causing earlier nesting within seasons. The potential fitness consequences of nesting earlier include extended periods of offspring growth and larger clutch sizes. Additionally, the potential for nesting seasons to last longer exists, possibly allowing species that lay multiple clutches within a season to increase the number of clutches produced. To date, no studies have examined consequences of earlier nesting on duration of nesting season in oviparous vertebrates. We demonstrate that warmer sea surface temperatures are related to earlier nesting in the Loggerhead Seaturtle Caretta caretta, and that this response actually decreases, rather than increases, the length of the nesting season. In recent years (1995-2003), nesting became more evenly distributed throughout the season than in earlier years (1989-1994), and the nesting season decreased by approximately 43 days. Female turtles are unlikely to produce additional clutches within a reproductive season in response to this effect because of physiological constraints, and we cannot rule out the hypothesis that female turtles will lay fewer clutches because of a shortened nesting season, leading to reduced fecundity within seasons.

1095,4566,The legendary hump-backed mahseer Tor sp. of India’s River Cauvery: an endemic fish swimming towards extinction?,"The Western Ghats region of India is an area of exceptional freshwater biodiversity and endemism. Mahseer of the genus Tor are considered prized sport fishes of great cultural significance; nevertheless, they are threatened as a result of increasing anthropogenic stressors. In the River Cauvery, the mahseer community comprises a 'blue-finned' and an orange-finned, 'hump-backed' fish. Whilst it is not yet known whether these are distinct species or 2 different phenotypes, evidence suggests that the hump-backed phenotype is endemic to the river, whereas the blue-finned phenotype was introduced in the 1980s. Angler-catch data from a managed fishery on the River Cauvery, gathered between 1998 and 2012 and comprising 23 620 h of fishing effort, revealed that captured individuals ranged in size from 0.45 to 46.8 kg, with the blue-finned phenotype comprising 95% of all captured fish and the remainder being hump-backed. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the blue-finned phenotype significantly increased over the study period, while the mean weight of individual fish significantly declined. By contrast, the CPUE of the hump-backed phenotype declined significantly over the period, with individual mean weights significantly increasing. These data suggest a recent recruitment collapse in the hump-backed phenotype resulting in an ageing population that may be headed towards extinction. The introduced blue-finned phenotype, however, continues to recruit strongly, suggesting that the mahseer community of the River Cauvery has undergone considerable shifts in the last 30 yr."
1096,868,"Multiannual fluctuations in precipitation and population dynamics of the montane vole, Microtus montanus.","Montane vole exhibits multiannual fluctuations in population density in NW Wyoming. Multiannual fluctuations in precipitation during May were also observed. For data from the past 19 yr, there is a significant negative correlation between precipitation during May and vole population dynamics, and there was a correlation between cycle phases of May precipitation and of population density. Peak precipitation in May (1970, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1984) was correlated in the same year with the decline phase in the population cycle. A trough in the May precipitation cycle (1969, 1973, 1976, 1979, 1983, 1985) was correlated in the same year with a population peak. Spring precipitation may contribute to the population dynamics by influencing survival and reproductive success of these rodents at a critical time, the onset of the breeding season. -from Author"
1097,4162,"Reducing longline bycatch: The larger the hook, the fewer the stingrays","Chondrichthyan populations in the Mediterranean Sea have been heavily affected by the impact of fishing activities. In the last two decades, even fishing gears that were traditionally considered highly selective, such as pelagic longlines, have been revealed to be responsible for the capture of many unwanted species. The pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) is not an endangered nor a charismatic species, but it largely dominates longlines bycatch fractions. The aim of our study was to investigate the importance of three main variables, bait size, presence and type of light attractors, and hook size and shape, in the capture rate of pelagic stingrays. Ninety-seven longline experimental sets were run. Trials took place on nine vessels in the Strait of Sicily, central Mediterranean Sea, over a period of 3 years from 2005 to 2007. Results showed that the larger the J hook, the lower the stingray capture rate. Moreover, 16/0 circle hooks had a significantly lower number of stingrays captured per 1000 hooks than J hooks, up to ∼80%. Bait size, within the range of sizes assessed, and use of light attractors did not have significant effects on stingray catch rate. These results suggest that the adoption of large circle hooks by commercial and artisanal swordfish longlining may be a measure to reduce their environmental footprint. "
1098,4526,"Area usage estimation and spatiotemporal variability in distribution patterns of southern right whales, Eubalaena australis, of southern Brazil"," Southern right whalesEubalaena australis (Desmoulins, 1822)migrate seasonally from high-latitude feeding grounds to coastal breeding and calving grounds at lower latitudes such as the southern coast of Brazil. Understanding how these whales are distributed along the coast is important for monitoring their postwhaling recovery and defining management strategies. In this study, we applied Kernel density estimators to aerial survey data to determine main occurrence and concentration areas of right whales in southern Brazil and investigate inter- and intra-annual distribution patterns between 2003 and 2012. Our results show considerable variation in area usage within and among years, and changes in the general distribution pattern of right whales in the last years of the study. Intra-annually, higher concentration area tended to expand from July to September and decrease in November. Some areas stood out as high-density areas for right whales: Ribanceira/Ibiraquera, Itapirubá Sul/Sol, and from Arroio to Gaivota. Some evidences also suggest preferential areas for mothercalf pairs. The higher concentration area of right whales in southern Brazil was estimated at 52,541 km2 and the occurrence area was 682.69 km2, which is the whole study area. As right whale distribution in the region is likely expanding due to this population's current recovery, our study provides essential information for management plan of the Right Whale Environmental Protection Area."
1099,3497,Declining catch rates of reef fish in Aldabra's marine protected area,"1. Fish landings from a small-scale subsistence fishery at Aldabra, Seychelles, were monitored from late 1995 to early 2007 to describe the predominant species caught, catch per unit effort (CPUE) and patterns in yield over time. 2. During this period a total of 19.5 tons of piscivores were caught, varying between 0.99 and 2.46 tons per annum. Effort data allowing for estimation of CPUE were available for 259 fishing trips and from 1998 onwards. 3. Over the study period, and in order of importance, Lutjanus bohar, Variola louti, Lethrinus nebulosus, Epinephelus multinotatus and Epinephelus polyphekadion made up over 80% of the total catch in terms of biomass. Using a general linear model, including fishing location and season as predictor variables, it was shown that CPUE declined significantly over the study period. Annual CPUE varied between 3.0 and 5.1 kg h-1 per person. 4. Throughout the period fishing pressure was low, and largely limited to the subsistence fishery. It is argued that changing catch rates are likely to have been independent of direct anthropogenic influences but a result of reef degradation following the 1998 bleaching event. "
1100,2399,Four years of vertebrate monitoring on an upper Amazonian river,"Long-term monitoring of tropical forest animals lags far behind long-term monitoring of tropical forest plants, compromising ecologists' ability to identify parallel trends. On 257 occasions over 4 years, park guards in a newly protected lowland Amazonian forest in southeastern Peru tallied individuals of 31 reptile, bird, and mammal species sighted along a 47-km stretch of river. Each survey entailed ~3 h of observation from a motorized boat; total survey effort was 892 h and ~12,048 km. Our primary goals were descriptive: to establish baseline sighting rates for these species and to document trends over time and the influence of environmental and sampling factors on sightings. Our secondary goals were to identify the advantages and disadvantages of river-based monitoring and to assess how useful these data are for ecologists and protected areas managers. Over the 4 years of monitoring we observed 1.8 animals/km. More than 90% of recorded individuals belonged to seven common taxa: two reptiles, four birds, and one mammal. Season was the most frequent correlate of sighting frequency; sightings increased in dry season. For the majority of taxa common enough to analyze, sightings increased over the 4 years of monitoring; this is possibly a result of reduced hunting since the establishment of the protected area. Compared to forest-based surveys, river-based surveys were inefficient at recording most mammals. Results to date suggest that river-based surveys can be a valuable, inexpensive tool for monitoring some ecologically important Amazonian animals, and especially those in protected areas. "
1101,3059,Potential recovery of a declined turtle population diminished by a community shift towards more generalist species,"Models suggest that a declined turtle population may rebound if the cause of decline is remedied and adult; mortality is reduced, but recovery time will likely be slow. In 2005-2007, we reexamined a river turtle community which; included a population of Northern Map Turtles (Graptemys geographica) that had been reduced by approximately 50%; between 1969 and 1980 likely as a result of harvesting, and had failed to rebound by 2004 despite no evidence of continued; harvesting. Comparisons of population estimates for G. geographica showed no significant differences between 2005 and; 2006 (z = 1.79, P = 0.073) or between 2006 and 2007 (z = 1.07, P = 0.284). However, the population estimate for; 2007 was not significantly different from the population estimate for 1969 (z = 0.48, P = 0.629) but was significantly; higher than the population estimate for 1980 (z = 2.96, P = 0.003), suggesting the population had returned to its predecline; (1969) size. While the recovery of the G. geographica population demonstrates that a previously harvested river; turtle population may rebound if no further harvesting occurs, the recovery period will be extensive, thus confirming model; predictions. Furthermore, the turtle community composition was shifting towards a higher relative abundance of generalist; species and a lower relative abundance of specialist species  a pattern that can be expected with habitat degradation, another; threat which may present new challenges to G. geographica, a dietary specialist."
1102,2814,Reproductive synchrony in a recovering bottlenecked sea turtle population,"The assessment of species extinction risk has been well established for some time now. Assessing the potential for recovery in endangered species is however much more challenging, because complementary approaches are required to detect reliable signals of positive trends. This study combines genetics, demography and behavioural data at three different time-scales to assess historical and recent population changes and evidence of reproductive synchrony in a small population of olive ridley sea turtle Lepidochelys olivacea. Lepidochelys is considered as the most extraordinary example of reproductive synchrony in reptiles, yet to date, it has only been reported in large populations. Using Bayesian coalescent-based models on microsatellite nuclear DNA variability, we demonstrate that effective population size in olive ridleys nesting in French Guiana has dramatically declined by 99% over the last 20 centuries. This low current population size is further illustrated by the absence of genetic mitochondrial DNA diversity in the present nesting population. Yet, monitoring of nesting sites in French Guiana suggests a possible recovery of the population over the last decade. Satellite telemetry shows that over the first 14days of their 28-days inter-nesting interval, i.e. when eggs maturation is likely to occur, gravid females disperse over the continental shelf. They then gather together with a striking spatiotemporal consistency close to the nesting site, where they later emerge for their second nesting event. Our results therefore suggest that reproductive synchrony also occurs in small populations. Olive ridleys may ensure this synchrony by adjusting the duration of the second half of their inter-nesting interval prior to landing, possibly through social mediation. Such reproductive synchrony may be related to the maintenance of some species-specific strategy despite former collapse and may contribute to the present population recovery. The gregarious behaviour of reproductive individuals close to shore where human-induced perturbations occur is however a cause for conservation concern for this still poorly known species. "
1103,3794,Status of Grauer's Gorilla and Chimpanzees in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo: historical and current distribution and abundance,"This report summarises the current state of knowledge on the distribution, densities and trends in abundance of Grauer's gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri) and the eastern Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It summarises the historical knowledge about the distribution of Grauer's gorilla across its range and describes the development of a Conservation Action Plan (CAP) for these two ape species. A result og this CAP was funding from Arcus Foundation, KfW, USAID, UNESCO and US Fish and Wildlife Service to undertake an assessment of the current status of these apes across the range of Grauer's gorilla. Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and Fauna & Flora International (FFI) worked with Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN) and the Reserve managers of the Reserve des Gorilles de Punia (RGPU) and local communities to undertake surveys across the region using a variety of methods: line transects, recces along paths and patrol data collected by rangers while on patrol and entered into SMART software. ; This survey region has been characterised by insecurity and lawlessness since the start of the Congolese civil war in 1996. Many militia groups have controlled different areas and established artisanal mining camps to fund their operations. Most of these mining camps rely on access to bushmeat; militia groups have controlled different areas and established artisanal mining camps to fund their operations. Most of these mining camps rely on access to bushmeat for the miners to survive and great apes are among the more highly prised species because of their relatively large size. "
1104,2523,"DIURNAL BIRDS OF PREY (AVES) FROM LETEA FOREST (THE DANUBE DELTA BIOSPHERE RESERVATION, ROMANIA)","Letea Forest has always represented a favorable place for the nesting of preying birds. In the past 3 decades, in Letea Forest, as well as in the entire Danube Delta, the number of species of birds of prey has fallen dramatically. In the current paperwork we tried to analyze the situation of the species of diurnal birds of prey identified in Letea Forest. During the study, that took place between November 2003 until September 2009, there were 24 species of preying birds observed, from which 6 are nesting species (Circus aeruginosus, Haliaeetus albicilla, Falco vespertinus, F. subbuteo, F. tinnunculus, Buteo buteo and Pernis apivorus), and the rest are winter guests, passing species and species with accidental presence in the study area."
1105,2128,Long-term fish and macro-crustacean community variation in a Mediterranean lagoon,"The fish and macro-crustacean community of the Vaccarès lagoon (Rhône River delta, South France) was sampled monthly from 1993 to 2002. The lagoon salinity shifted from 15 in 1993 to 5 in 1994-1997 and went back to 15 in 1999-2002. Connections with the sea also varied during the study period with larger openings in 1996-1997. During the study period, the community changed to revert in 2002 to a state similar to 1993. These changes consisted of a sequence of increased and decreased patterns of freshwater species and some marine species. Typical lagoon species tended to resist to salinity changes. Freshwater species colonised the lagoon when the salinity was low. Marine species may have varied both in relation to connections with the sea and to indirect effects of freshwater outflow. This study shows that community changes following environmental variations can be delayed in time, and emphasises the need for long-term studies. "
1106,2210,Thirteen years of the corncrake Crex crex census at Lake Cerknica (Slovenia). Trinajst let popisov kosca Crex crex na Cerkniskem jezeru (Slovenija),"Between 1992 and 2004, annual censuses of Corncrakes Crex crex were carried gout at Lake Cerknica, mainly during the first weekend in June. Calling males were counted during the night from 23:00 to 03:00 hours. In the 13 years, a total of 91 ornithologists contributed their voluntary work. The 26 km2 large Lake Cerknica was divided into six areas, which were separately investigated by smaller groups of ornithologists who mapped every singing male. The lowest number of calling Corncrakes, i.e. 42, was registered in 1997, the highest, i.e. 101, in 1993. On the basis of the carried out study, the 60 to 90 calling males are stated as an average calling male population at Lake Cerknica. The number of calling birds changed significantly during the study period. The high water level in some years proved to be in statistically significant negative correlation and seems to be one of the reasons for oscillations. During the mapping, the distribution of Corncrakes at Lake Cerknica and the habitat preference was established. The most suitable habitat for Lake Cerknica's Corncrakes is a mixture of wet meadows, particularly the communities Deschampsio-Plantaginetum altissimae with occasionally mowed sedges Magnocaricion. Some areas, where Corncrakes were present in the early 1990s, are no longer suitable for breeding due to the cessation of mowing. Nevertheless, the population of Corncrakes at Lake Cerknica seems to be stable at the moment."
1107,2553,"Increases in the relative abundance of mid-trophic level fishes concurrent with declines in apex predators in the subtropical north Pacific, 1996-2006","Catch rates for the 13 most abundant species caught in the deep-set Hawaii-based longline fishery over the past decade (1996[long dash]2006) provide evidence of a change among the top North Pacific subtropical predators. Catch rates for apex predators such as blue shark (Prionace glauca), bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and albacore (Thunnus alalunga) tunas, shortbill spearfish (Tetrapturus angustirostris), and striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax) declined by 3% to 9% per year and catch rates for four midtrophic species, mahimahi (Coryphaena hippurus), sickle pomfret (Taractichthys steindachneri), escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum), and snake mackerel (Gempylus serpens), increased by 6% to 18% per year. The mean trophic level of the catch for these 13 species declined 5%, from 3.85 to 3.66. A shift in the ecosystem to an increase in midtrophic-level, fast- growing and short-lived species is indicated by the decline in apex predators in the catch (from 70% to 40%) and the increase in species with production to biomass values of 1.0 or larger in the catch (from 20% to 40%). This altered ecosystem may exhibit more temporal variation in response to climate variability."

1109,4435,"Recent trends in numbers of wandering (Diomedea exulans), black-browed (Thalassarche melanophris) and grey-headed (T. chrysostoma) albatrosses breeding at South Georgia","South Georgia supports globally important populations of seabirds, including the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophris and grey-headed albatross T. chrysostoma, currently classified by the world Conservation Union (IUCN) as vulnerable, near threatened and endangered, respectively. Surveys of these species at South Georgia were conducted during the incubation stage in November 2014 to January 2015, repeating previous surveys conducted in the 2003/2004 season. Numbers of wandering albatrosses breeding annually at South Georgia decreased by 18% (1.8% per year) from 1553 pairs in 2003/2004 to an estimated 1278 pairs in 2014/2015. Over the same period, black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses decreased by 19% (1.9% per year) and 43% (5% per year), respectively. These represent a continuation of negative trends at South Georgia since the 1970s and are in contrast to some populations elsewhere, which have shown signs of recent recovery. Given the importance of South Georgia for these species, the ongoing population declines, and in the case of grey-headed albatrosses, an acceleration of the decline is of major conservation concern. Incidental fisheries mortality (bycatch) is currently considered to be the main threat. Although seabird bycatch has been reduced to negligible levels in the fisheries operating around South Georgia, wider implementation of effective seabird bycatch mitigation measures is required to improve the conservation status of the South Georgia populations of wandering, black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses. In addition, more research is required to investigate the respective roles of bycatch and climate change in driving these population trends."
1110,2890,The decline and recovery of four predatory fishes from the Southern California Bight,"What to do about fisheries collapse and the decline of large fishes in marine ecosystems is a critical debate on a global scale. To address one aspect of this debate, a major fisheries management action, the removal of gill nets in 1994 from the nearshore arena in the Southern California Bight ( 34[degree] 26' 30'' N, 120[degree]27' 09'' W to 33[degree]32'03'' N, 117 07[degree] 28'' W) was analyzed. First, the impetus for the gill net ban was the crash of the commercial fishery for white seabass ( Atractoscion nobilis; Sciaenidae) in the early 1980s. From 1982 to 1997 catch remained at a historically low level ( 47.8 [plus or minus] 3.0 mt) when compared to landings from 1936 - 1981, but increased significantly from 1995 - 2004 ( r = 0.89, P 0.01) to within the 95% confidence limit of the historic California landings. After the white seabass fishery crashed in the early 1980s, landings of soupfin ( Galeorhinus galeus; Triakidae) and leopard shark ( Triakis semifasciata; Triakidae) also significantly declined ( r = 0.95, P 0.01 and r = 0.91, P 0.01, respectively) until the gill net closure. After the closure both soupfin and leopard shark significantly increased in CPUE ( r = 0.72, P = 0.02 and r = 0.87, P 0.01, respectively). Finally, giant sea bass ( Stereolepis gigas; Polyprionidae) the apex predatory fish in this ecosystem, which was protected from commercial and recreational fishing in 1981, were not observed in a quarterly scientific SCUBA monitoring program from 1974 to 2001 but reappeared in 2002 2004. In addition, CPUE of giant seabass increased significantly from 1995 to 2004 ( r = 0.82, P 0.01) in the gill net monitoring program. The trends in abundance of these fishes return were not correlated with sea surface temperature ( SST), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO) or the El Nino/ Southern Oscillation ( ENSO). All four species increased significantly in either commercial catch, CPUE, or in the SCUBA monitoring program after the 1994 gill net closure, whereas they had declined significantly, crashed, or were absent prior to this action. This suggests that removing gill nets from coastal ecosystems has a positive impact on large marine fishes."
1111,3678,Standardization of CPUE of loggerhead sea turtle ( Caretta caretta) caught by pelagic longliners in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean,"The population abundance estimates used in stock assessments or required to establish management measures, depend on the sampling of the entire demographic spectrum of a population resident in a given area. However, for sea turtles, most population estimates are based mainly on nesting beach survey data and only consider a fraction of the population. The Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWA) is an important foraging and development area for juveniles of the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta where reproductive stocks from various nesting beaches mix. Declines in C. caretta populations have been observed in many parts of the world and bycatch rates of this species in the SWA are among the highest worldwide. This study standardizes the catch rates of loggerheads caught by pelagic longline fisheries in the region, using data collected by observer programs from Brazil and Uruguay. Generalized linear models (GLM) with a delta lognormal approximation were used. The variables used in the model take into account spatial and temporal variations as well as the characteristics of the fleet. In total, 6 272 344 hooks were observed between 1998 and 2007, with minimum effort registered in 2000 (12 010 hooks) and maximum effort in 2005 (1 989 431 hooks). During this period 3778 loggerheads were incidentally captured. The catch rates of loggerheads by the Uruguayan and Brazilian pelagic longline fisheries show oscillations through the years without a clear tendency; however, a low negative trend was observed from 1998 to 2005 with an increase in the last two years (2006 and 2007). The capture per unit of effort (CPUE) values varied between 0.38 to 1.78 ind/1000 hooks in 2005 and 2007, respectively. Distinct zones with differential catch rates were identified, with the higher CPUE values over the continental slope of Uruguay and adjacent waters. The incidental catch rates of this species are influenced, not only by fishing area, but also by year, season, sea surface temperature and gear type. In consequence, these variables and other potential ones should be considered in bycatch estimates by different fisheries because the loggerhead sea turtles are not uniformly distributed. This study intends to contribute not only to the general knowledge of loggerhead sea turtles in the SWA but to a future assessment of their populations at a global scale. "
1112,3369,Winter diet of marten during a Snowshoe hare decline,"We examined the winter diet of marten (Martes americana) from northern (65-67°N) and southern (60-62°N) regions of the western Northwest Territories from 1988-1989 to 1993-1994 during a decline in snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) abundance that started in 1990. We used 4256 marten carcasses collected from trappers to examine changes in diet, productivity, age and sex structure of the harvest, and body and reproductive indices. Arvicoline rodents formed the greatest proportion (41-95% occurrence of total prey items) of the annual winter diet in both regions and snowshoe hares constituted 1-39% of prey items. Snowshoe hares constituted 3-64% of the diet when expressed as biomass. Dietary proportions of arvicolines increased and snowshoe hares decreased with time in the northern region but not in the southern region. Female marten took proportionately more arvicolines and males took more snowshoe hares. Juvenile marten took proportionately more snowshoe hares, while adults took more arvicolines. The proportion of juvenile marten in the harvest declined in both regions between 1991-1992 and 1993-1994. The ratio of juveniles to adult females in the harvest also declined with time in the southern region but not in the northern region. The amount of omental fat declined with time for most age and sex classes. Ovulation rates (as determined by counts of corpora lutea) declined with time among yearlings, and among adults from the southern region but not in the northern region. In utero litter size did not change. We suggest that the snowshoe hare population cycle has a significant impact on marten populations in the northern boreal forest."
1113,751,Suitability of a young deciduous-dominated forest for American marten and the effects of forest removal,"American marten (Martes americana (Turton, 1806)) are generally considered to be reliant upon and most successful in continuous late-successional coniferous forests. By contrast, young seral forests and deciduous-dominated forests are assumed to provide low-quality marten habitat, primarily as a result of insufficient structure, overhead cover, and prey. This study examined a moderate-density population of marten in northeastern British Columbia in what appeared to be comparatively low-quality, deciduous-dominated habitat, overgrown agricultural land primarily consisting of 30- to 40-year-old stands of regenerating trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). Over 4 years, we monitored 52 radio-collared marten. The population appeared to be stable, as indicated by large numbers of adults, relatively constant densities, long-term residency of many individuals, low mortality rates, and older age structure. Relatively small home ranges (males, 3.3 km2; females, 2.0 km 2) implied good habitat quality and prey availability. Shearing (removal of immature forest cover) of 17% of the study area resulted in home range shifts at the individual level but no detectable impact at the population level. Categorically, marten avoided nonforested cover types and preferred mature coniferous (>25% conifer) stands (7% of the study area) but otherwise appeared to use all forested stands relative to their availability, including extensive use of deciduous-dominated stands and deciduous stands <40 years of age. Thus, these young deciduous forests appeared to have sufficient structure, overhead cover, and prey to maintain moderate densities of resident marten on a long-term basis."
1114,2027,Distribution and abundance of emus Dromaius novaehollandiae in relation to the environment in the South Australian pastoral zone,"The distribution and abundance of Emus in the South Australian pastoral zone between 1978 and 1989 was determined by winter aerial surveys. The average number of Emu groups present ranged from a low of 0.02 km-2 in 1983 to 0.08 km-2 in 1980, 1981 and 1988. Between 1984 and 1989, average size of these groups was found to range from 2.22 to 4.55 Emus. Although the distribution varied from year to year, Emu density was generally highest in the northeast of the pastoral zone and lowest in the more arid northwest. The northeast of the pastoral zone is a relatively productive area, containing a mixture of land systems, particularly 'run-on' areas. The low open woodlands and tall shrublands of the northwest and south of the pastoral zone supported low densities of Emus. Areas of high Emus density were generally dominated by more intensive sheep grazing, by fans and/or hills, by red duplex soils, and by low shrublands of predominantly bluebush. Rainfall during summer and autumn was considered an important determinant of Emu density, with this period being important in terms of egg production."
1115,3677,Population Structure of Podocnemis expansa (Testudines: Podocnemididae) in Southern Brazilian Amazon,"Detailed studies of the population structure of most species of turtles in the Amazon Basin are lacking throughout their range. We estimated sex ratio, size structure, relative abundance, and recapture index for the Giant South American River Turtle (Podocnemis expansa) in Javaés River, southern Brazilian Amazon. Field work was conducted between 2004 and 2009, and comprised a total sampling effort of 368 hours in 92 sampling days. Turtles were captured by diving and seining. A total of 645 individuals (156 adult males, 109 adult females, and 380 juveniles) were captured and marked, but only five were recaptured. Carapace length showed a unimodal pattern for males, but no clear pattern for females. The population consisted predominantly of adult males and young females, with a sex ratio of 1.4:1 (M:F). Relative abundance varied from 0-5.5 animals/h depending on the capture method employed. Most animals (73.7%) were concentrated in a single location on the river (1 km out of 40 km sampled) during the study period. Population monitoring on a long-term basis will be necessary to identify the real population structure, evaluate poaching pressure, and to support the conservation project which has been ongoing since 1985 in the area."
1116,1635,"Long-term Changes in Recruitment to the Breeding Group, and the Quality of Recruits at a Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla Colony","The number of recruits to the North Shields kittiwake colony in NE England increased from 1954-1967, but the proportion of first breeders decreased during that time. Increased mortality of the breeding birds or the provision of more sites increased recruitment. This implied that there was a pool of potential recruits from which the new recruits needed could be drawn. In most years there appeared to be a non-breeding reservoir. About 11% of each cohort returned to breed in their natal colony. Immatures did not suffer the same variations in mortality as did adults; this finding is consistent with the premise that increased adult mortality associated with the decline in numbers in the late 1960s occurred prior to the breeding season. Age of first breeding fell from 5 to 4 yr in response to high adult mortality in the early 1970s; body weights and wing-lengths of male and female recruits diminished, but the body weights of male and female prospectors fluctuated little. A model of colony growth is based on the relationship between colony size and rate of increase in expanding colonies of British kittiwakes. Small colonies grow faster than large ones, and are more attractive to recruits. Small colonies cannot produce enough young during the first 70 yr and are sustained by immigration. The North Shields colony is not a closed system and is not currently growing; it is supported by immigration. There is a positive relationship between colony size and nesting density; colony growth appeared to be limited by the number of attractive sites in the dense centre of the colony. -from Authors"
1117,1408,"The invasive red swamp crayfish as a predictor of Eurasian bittern density in the Camargue, France","Few data exist on the relationships between food levels and breeding density of the Eurasian bittern Botaurus stellaris, a vulnerable species of high-priority concern in Europe. Concurrent data were obtained on male bittern density and relative food abundance over a 3-year period in two wetlands totalling 2500 ha of Mediterranean reed marsh enclosing 25% of the French bittern population. Food abundance was estimated by sampling up to 25 hydrological units using a beach seine in early June of 2002, 2003 and 2004. The density of booming males in each hydrological unit was obtained by point counts and acoustic triangulation in May of the same years. The impact of food abundance on male bittern density was assessed by general regression models using a forward stepwise procedure with mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, carp Cyprinus carpio, other fish species, amphibians, red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii and other invertebrates as prey groups. Of these, only to crayfish abundance was bittern density related, contributing to 45% of the variance observed. When the impact of water level was taken into account, the relative abundance of crayfish explained 56% of the inter-annual differences in bittern density. Because crayfish are rich in calcium and well adapted to fluctuating hydroperiods alternating with drought intervals, they provide a good food source for the bitterns throughout the breeding season at the study sites. The loss of diversity and degradation reported from macrophyte-dominated marshes following crayfish invasion does not seem to apply to reed-dominated wetlands. It is further suggested that the recent increase in bittern numbers in the Camargue, while other French populations were decreasing, could in part be related to red swamp crayfish abundance. "
1118,1358,A new estimate of the population size of the Critically Endangered Rodrigues fruit bat Pteropus rodricensis,"The Rodrigues fruit bat Pteropus rodricensis is endemic to Rodrigues Island, the smallest of the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. The species is categorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. A study between February 2001 and February 2002 identified 10 roosts, four previously unrecorded. Roost sites were located in the north and south of the island, all within forested valleys. Sixteen counts of each roost site, evenly spaced throughout the study period, showed dramatic changes in individual colony numbers, suggest-ing movement between roosts. Simultaneous counts of all colonies resulted in a minimum population estimate of 5,076, which is substantially higher than previous estimates of the species. This is believed to be due to a population increase since the last count, newly identified roosts and the movement of bats into different areas, allowing more accurate counts to be made. "
1119,3457,Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion,"This study documented temporal variation in the abundance of butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae) at Trunk Reef, on the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia, from May 2000 to March 2005. During this period, live coral cover declined by >90%, mostly due to severe coral bleaching. There were no short-term changes (within 4 months) in the abundance of butterflyfishes following initial declines in live coral cover. Surveys conducted in 2005, however, revealed significant declines in the abundance of Chaetodon baronessa, Chaetodon lunulatus, Chaetodon trifascialis, Chaetodon plebeius and Chaetodon rainfordi, all of which are obligate hard-coral feeders. In contrast, there was no significant change in the abundance of Chaetodon auriga, Chaetodon aureofasciatus, Chaetodon citrinellus, Chaetodon melannotus or Chaetodon vagabundus, which are much less reliant on scleractinian coral for food. Clearly, extensive coral depletion, such as that caused by severe coral bleaching, can have a major effect on the abundance of butterflyfishes. Specific responses of butterflyfishes varied according to their reliance on hard corals for food and their ability to utilize alternate prey types. "
1120,4457,"Cutting trees in a secondary forest to increase gaur Bos gaurus numbers in Khao Phaeng Ma Reforestation area, Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Thailand","The value of tourism for gaur Bos gaurus in the Khao Phang Ma reforestation area, which borders Khao Yai  Dong Phaya Yen World Heritage Site, decreased when a large number of gaurs moved away from the watching area of the former grassland in the middle of the secondary forest. A major cause appeared to be an increase in the number and size of pioneer trees Macaranga siamensis that overshadowed gaurs food patches. We constructed a 5.7 ha pilot plot where 407 pioneer trees were cut down in an attempt to attract gaurs back to the area. Since tree cutting was a controversial practice, especially with local people, we engaged with, and were supported by, a local non-governmental organization throughout the process. We monitored the density of gaurs using the total counts of dung piles. The estimated density of gaurs was significantly higher in the pilot plot compared with an adjacent control plot (8.62 individuals/km2/day versus 3.95 individuals/km2/day), demonstrating a positive impact of tree felling in attracting this species back to an area."
1121,659,"Distribution, abundance and conservation status of dugongs and dolphins in the southern and western Arabian Gulf","The marine mammals of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were censussed by three strip-transect aerial surveys. The Arabian Gulf supports a population of ca. 5800 dugongs (Dugong dugon), which is the largest known outside Australia. The most important habitats occur (1) around Murawah Island (UAE), (2) between Qatar and Bahrain and (3) between Qatar and the UAE. Surveys of the UAE were repeated 13 years apart. The two estimates of the dugong population were not significantly different, suggesting a stable population of ca. 3000 between 1986 and 1999. In the region between Kuwait and Oman, the Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) is the most common cetacean (71% of groups and individuals), followed by the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis; 27%) and finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides; 2%). The estimates of cetacean abundance in the UAE differed significantly between 1986 and 1999 and indicate a population decline of 71%. At least two die-offs of marine mammals occurred between these surveys. The countries of the southern Gulf are developed and affluent and are well positioned to take a lead in marine conservation in the region. A coordinated series of protected areas could greatly enhance the long-term prospects for marine mammals and other components of biodiversity in the region. "
1122,2625,"Effects of more frequent and prolonged El Nino events on life-history parameters of the degu, a long-lived and slow-reproducing rodent","Global climate change (GCC) can have profound effects on species whose ecology is governed primarily by climatic factors. The ecology of small mammals inhabiting semiarid Chile is strongly affected by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During La Nina events in this area, dry conditions prevail and species may disappear from the thorn-scrub habitat. Conversely, El Nino events bring high rainfall, and associated pulses of food trigger small-mammal population increases. We used capture-mark-recapture to study responses of the degu (Octodon degus), a dominant small mammal, to variation in rainfall over 18 years. In response to a recent trend toward wetter conditions, degus reached record-high densities and maintained more stable numbers in the area. Underlying mechanisms involved variation in adult survival, juvenile persistence, and fecundity linked to rainfall changes during consecutive years (i.e., rainfall phases). During prolonged droughts, degus had low survival and produced fewer offspring, with low persistence. Following high rainfall, these parameters reversed; consecutive wet years resulted in further increases. Weak declines in fecundity and adult survival and high persistence of juveniles explained delayed responses to deteriorating conditions in initial dry years. If GCC leads to increased frequency of El Nino events, we anticipate greater numerical dominance of degus in semiarid Chile and possible range expansion. Furthermore, degus have strong impacts on other small mammal and some plant species, are important prey species, and are agricultural pests and disease reservoirs. Hence, GCC has the potential to dramatically influence their ecology in northern Chile and to have cascading effects on other components of this system."
1123,4553,Survival and growth of tuatara Sphenodon punctatus following translocation from the Cook Strait to warmer locations in their historic range,"Post-translocation monitoring is fundamental for assessing translocation success and identifying potential threats. We measured outcomes for four cohorts of tuatara Sphenodon punctatus translocated to warmer climates outside of their ecological region, to understand effects of climate warming. Translocation sites were on average 2-4 °C warmer than the source site. We used three short-term measures of success: survival, growth and reproduction. Data on recaptures, morphometric measurements, and reproduction were gathered over 2.5 years following release. Although decades of monitoring will be required to determine long-term translocation success in this species, we provide an interim measure of population progress and translocation site suitability. We found favourable recapture numbers, growth of founders and evidence of reproduction at most sites, with greater increases in body mass observed at warmer, less densely populated sites. Variable growth in the adult population at one translocation site suggested that higher population density, intraspecific competition, and lower water availability could be responsible for substantial weight loss in multiple individuals, and we make management recommendations to reduce population density. Overall, we found that sites with warmer climates and lower population densities were potentially beneficial to translocated tuatara, probably because of enhanced temperature-dependent and density-dependent growth rates. We conclude that tuatara could benefit from translocations to warmer sites in the short term, but further monitoring of this long-lived species is required to determine longer-term population viability following translocation. Future vulnerability to rising air temperatures, associated water availability, and community and ecosystem changes beyond the scope of this study must be considered."
1124,1537,Decline and recovery in otter Lutra lutra populations in Italy,"1. Changes in otter Lutra lutra distribution in Italy were examined by analysing geographical, historical and survey data. 2. As in other European countries, otters declined sharply in Italy during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. Between 1985 and 2004 the species became extinct, except for some reintroductions, in northern and most of central Italy while the species appears to have substantially recovered in its southern range. This recovery of the otter population is apparently not due to increased research effort, but reflects a real expansion of range. 3. Differences in the degree of range reduction during the second half of the 20th century and in the availability of suitable habitats are probably the major factors that have determined the two opposite trends shown by otter populations in the last 20 years. 4. Better knowledge of otter status and distribution is needed for effective conservation management. We suggest that a national survey of the Italian otter population that employs genetic approaches should represent a first step of the national action plan for otter conservation. "
1125,3057,"A 13-year study of a northern population of Twinspotted rattlesnakes (Crotalus pricei): growth, reproduction, survival, and conservation","We conducted a 13-yr study of Crotalus pricei in Arizonas Chiricahua Mountains, capturing 306 individual snakes and recapturing snakes on 155 occasions. Juveniles shed and fed more frequently and grew more quickly than adults. Spiny lizard (Sceloporus) scales were found in 78% of fecal samples, making Sceloporus the most common prey item for both juveniles and adults. Males became larger than females at 5 yr of age, a year or two after females reached reproductive size. Although 45% of adult females were gravid, reproduction was not typically biennial and larger snakes were more likely to be gravid than smaller adult snakes. Survival rate (mean +/- SE) at our most-studied site was 0.707 +/- 0.0334 and detectability was 0.309 +/- 0.0386; detectability was positively correlated with number of search hours and negatively correlated with dry weather. Mean population size at this site was 67 snakes, and there was no evidence of a population decline over the course of the study. However, age class structure was skewed toward younger snakes at the site, probably due to illegal collection of snakes for the pet trade."
1126,2522,Der Seeadler (Haliaeetus albicilla) in Österreich: Das WWF Österreich Seeadlerprojekt,"The paper deals with the development of the White-tailed Eagle population since the 1990s in Austria. It outlines the; White-tailed Eagle project of the WWF Austria that has been implemented with numerous partners. Basic data are archived in; a White-tailed Eagle database (>1.000 observations from >100 reporters), additionally a nest catalogue (under seal) as well as; compilations of White-tailed Eagles in captivity (N = 15) and in public collections (N = 88) exist. Due to the topographic fea-; tures, White-tailed Eagles occur almost exclusively in the eastern lowland areas of Austria. In core areas (Neusiedler See ; Seewinkel  Hanság, Parndorfer Platte  Leithaniederung, Danube floodplains to Linz and east of Vienna as well as in the Morava-; Dyje region), synchronous counts of wintering eagles have been conducted since 2001. In Austria and its border areas, overall; 100150 White-tailed Eagles are present in mid-winter. Currently, 710 White-tailed Eagle pairs breed in the federal territory.; After decades of absence, the species returned as a successful breeding bird in 2001. The breeding population spreads across; the federal states Styria, Burgenland and Lower Austria. In the period 20012008, 38 young eagles fledged from 7 eyries. The rate; of successful breeding pairs (percentage of successful broods) was 67,6%, total nest success (number of young per breeding pair); was 1,1 chicks and brood size (number of young per successful breeding pair) was 1,7. At present, 60% of the eagles breed in artificial,; 40% in self-built nests. There are 13 recoveries, almost exclusively from a northeasterly direction. White-tailed Eagles; from the Baltic States, Scandinavia and north-west Russia reach Austria regularly. That White-tailed Eagles are versatile hunters; (birds, fish, mammals, carrion as well as kleptoparasitism) could also be ascertained in Austria. However, regional as well as seasonal; differences exist (e.g. geese prevailing in the Seewinkel region are entirely absent in the Waldviertel). Since 2007, Austria; participates in the International Colour-ringing Programme; 8 young have been ringed so far. There is a wide range of risk and; mortality factors, with persecution (esp. carbofuran poisoning, but also illegal shooting) being still of particular importance in; Austria. Nest losses (esp. due to forestry work) as well as collisions (with wires, railways etc.) regularly occur. The WWF Austria"
1127,2938,Density of red and roe deer and their distribution in relation to different habitat characteristics in a floodplain forest,"Density and distribution of red deer (Cervus elaphus L., 1758) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L., 1758) in relation to habitat structure and distribution of food sources was studied using simple faeces transects and monitoring plots during winter in a floodplain forest along the Morava River. Deer densities detected on monitoring plots and parallel simple faeces transects were comparable, so we used the faeces transects, thus enabling us to gather data from a larger part of study area. Densities of both species were relatively high (red and roe deer; 9.6 and 7.0 ind./km2 respectively). Red deer preferred forest stands with dense (60-80 %) cover and a diversified shrub layer (more than three tree species). Roe deer mainly used old stands of age 50-99 years with a high cover of canopy layer and conversely low cover of herb layer, dominated by bramble. A positive relationship between the distributions of both species was detected. Inter-specific spatial interference was not observed, despite their high densities in the study area."
1128,1387,The Contribution to Long-Term Research at Gombe National Park to Chimpanzee Conservation,"Long-term research projects can provide important conservation benefits, not only through research specifically focused on conservation problems, but also from various incidental benefits, such as increased intensity of monitoring and building support for the protection of an area. At Gombe National Park, Tanzania, long-term research has provided at least four distinct benefits to wildlife conservation. (1) Jane Goodall's groundbreaking discoveries of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) tool use, hunting, and complex social relationships in what was then a game reserve drew attention to the area and created support for upgrading Gombe to national park status in 1968. (2) The highly publicized findings have earned Gombe and Tanzania the attention of a worldwide public that includes tourists and donors that provide financial support for Gombe, other parks in Tanzania, and chimpanzee conservation in general. (3) Crucial information on social structure and habitat use has been gathered that is essential for effective conservation of chimpanzees at Gombe and elsewhere. (4) A clear picture of Gombe's chimpanzee population over the past 40 years has been determined, and this has helped identify the greatest threats to the viability of this population, namely disease and habitat loss outside the park. These threats are severe and because of the small size of the population it is extremely vulnerable. Research at Gombe has led to the establishment of conservation education and development projects around Gombe, which are needed to build local support for the park and its chimpanzees, but saving these famous chimpanzees will take a larger integrated effort on the part of park managers, researchers, and the local community with financial help from international donors.

1129,4611,Fish assemblage dynamics in an intermittent river of the northern Australian wet-dry tropics,"Intermittent rivers make up a large portion of the global river network and are the dominant river type in northern Australia. Increased pressure is being placed on such systems, and a better understanding of their ecology is needed. We examined, over a 7-year period, the fish fauna of the intermittent Fergusson River, a major tributary of the Daly River of the northern Australia. Changes in habitat structure with the onset of the dry season involved contraction of the riffle/run/pool habitat to a single refugial pool, the size of which was determined by antecedent wet season hydrology. The fishes present comprised a subset of species present within the Daly River main channel and consisted of the most widely distributed of northern Australia's freshwater fishes. The Fergusson River provides suitable spawning habitat for species during the wet season (e.g. Hephaestus fuliginosus, Leiopotherapon unicolor and Neosilurus catfishes) and during the dry season for a different set of species (e.g. Amniataba percoides, Melanotaenia australis and Glossogobius aureus). Little year-to-year variation in assemblage structure was observed early in the dry season, whereas interannual variation in late dry season assemblages was substantial. Dry season recruitment imparted some of the interannual variability in assemblage structure recorded between late dry season samples. Piscivorous fishes were an important, but temporally variable, component of the assemblage present in the late dry season refugial habitat, and predation was potentially another important source of variation in assemblage structure."
1130,2244,Census of the nesting aquatic avifauna of the Massaciuccoli lake marsh (Lucca-Pisa),"During the reproductive seasons of 1992-1999, a census was carried out on the numbers and distribution of water fowl nesting in the marsh of the Massaciuccoli lake. The resulting observations have highlighted that of the 24 reproductive species present 19 are regular. The quantitive estimate has shown a notable increase in the number of pairs up to 1997 (2811-3199 in 1992; 3517-3840 in 1997) but a slight drop in 1998 and 1999. On the basis of this data, Massaciuccoli can be considered the most important wetland in Tuscany for the reproduction of waterfowl, with a great number of Rails and Warblers. Noteworty mention must be made of the numbers of Botaurus stellaris, Ardea purpurea. Circus aeruginosus, Rallus aquaticus and Acrocephalus melanopogon in the area that are of regional and national importance."
1131,3822,Spatial Variation in Density and Total Size Estimates in Fragmented Primate Populations: The Golden-Crowned Sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli),"The golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli) is an endangered lemur species found only in the Daraina region, a very restricted area in north-eastern Madagascar. Its forest habitat is highly fragmented and expected to suffer from significant changes in the near future. The species is poorly known and only one census study, carried out in 2000, has ever been published. It is thus crucial to update the conservation status of the golden-crowned sifaka before major anthropogenic environmental changes take place. Using the line-transect approach, we estimated the species density in the main forest fragments located in both the peripheral and central parts of the distribution range, including both protected and unprotected areas. In parallel, we tried to determine whether an edge effect could be detected by comparing densities at different distances from the forest edges. We found important variation of sifaka densities among forest fragments. The total species abundance is thus difficult to determine, but we estimated that it is likely to be over 18,000, two to three times higher than previously thought. However, our data also suggested that most P. tattersalli live in forests located in the central part of the distribution range and that the estimated densities in the central part were high (480 individuals/km2). Two forest fragments, found to host a large part of the total population, are currently outside the managed area and their incorporation to the managed area is strongly recommended. Lastly, as expected for a folivorous and not heavily hunted species, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that this species does not experience a clear edge effect, at least during the first half of the dry season. This could be due to a high resiliency to habitat fragmentation or to the fact that; fragmentation has been going on for some time."
1132,3952,"Introduced mammals coexist with seabirds at New Island, Falkland Islands: abundance, habitat preferences, and stable isotope analysis of diet","The largest known colony of Thin-billed prions; Pachyptila belcheri has been coexisting with introduced; mammals for more than 100 years. Three of the introduced; mammals are potential predators of adults, eggs and chicks,; namely ship rats Rattus rattus, house mice Mus musculus; and feral cats Felis catus. We here determine habitat preferences; over three seasons and dietary patterns of the unique; set of introduced predators at New Island, Falkland Islands,; with emphasis on the ship rats. Our study highlights spatial; and temporal diVerences in the levels of interaction; between predators and native seabirds. Rats and mice had a; preference for areas providing cover in the form of the; native tussac grass Parodiochloa Xabellata or introduced; gorse Ulex europaeus. Their diet diVered markedly; between areas, over the season and between age groups in; rats. During the incubation period of the prions in November; December, ship rats had mixed diets, composed mainly; of plants and mammals, while only 3% of rats had ingested; birds. The proportion of ingested birds, including scavenged,; increased in the prion chick-rearing period, when; 60% of the rats consumed prions. We used 13C and 15N; to compare the importance of marine-derived food between; mammal species and individuals, and found that rats in all; but one area took diet of partly marine origin, prions being; the most frequently encountered marine food. Most house; mice at New Island mainly had terrestrial diet. The stable; isotope analysis of tissues with diVerent turnover times; indicated that individual rats and mice were consistent in; their diet over weeks, but opportunistic in the short term.; Some individuals (12% of rats and 7% of mice) were highly; specialized in marine-derived food. According to the isotope; ratios in a small sample of cat faeces, rodents and rabbits; were the chief prey of cats at New Island. Although; some individuals of all three predators supplement their terrestrial; diet with marine-derived food, the current impact of; predation by mammals on the large population of Thinbilled; prions at New Island appears small due to a number; of factors, including the small size of rodent populations; and restriction mainly to small areas providing cover."
1133,2609,"Breeding dynamics of a Gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua population at Cierva Point, Antarctic Peninsula","Aspects of the breeding biology of the Gentoo Penguin Pygoscelis papua were studied at Cierva Point, Antarctic Peninsula (64°09'S, 60°57'W). From a breeding population of 1044 pairs (85% with two eggs), 83% raised at least one chick to fledging. Survival in different subcolonies was neither correlated with perimeter-area ratio nor with distance to the sea. Chick mortality at the end of January 1993 was 23.9%, whereas for the 1991/92 breeding season it was 14.0%; for 1993/94, 23.9%; for 1994/95, 33.0% and for 1995/96 24.3%. By 17 February 1993, chick mortality was 32.3%. Chick survival was regressed against time for nine selected subcolonies, showing a high correlation between them. Covariance analysis among the regression line slopes showed a non-significant result (F = 0.42, P > 0.05). No significant differences were also observed when Tuckey's multiple contrasts test was performed on the proportions of surviving chicks in-between weeks (P > 0.05), showing a gradual mortality of chicks from egg-laying to créching. These results show that the Gentoo Penguin colony at Cierva Point contains a higher proportion of pairs rearing two chicks and a lower mortality rate than does the species at other maritime Antarctic sites. Average annual growth of the colony increased by 5.7% from 1991 to 1996, in contrast to the period 1954-1958 when the colony decreased by -2.3%. The low impact of the Argentinean station near the study area could account for this fact."
1134,3820,Status of the Madagascar Fish Eagle Haliaeetus vociferoides in 1995,"Surveys for the Madagascar Fish Eagle Haliaeetus vociferoides were conducted each breeding season (May through October) from 199 1 through 1995 between Morondava and Antsiranana, western to northwestern Madagascar, to estimate the population size of this endangered species. Suitable habitat including lakes, rivers, estuaries, mangroves, and marine islands was searched and at least 222 adult Madagascar Fish Eagles were observed including 63 breeding pairs, 36 probable pairs, 24 single adults and 18 immature birds. Assuming that all probable pairs were breeding, we estimated the Madagascar Fish Eagle breeding population was 99 pairs (95% confidence interval = 78 to 120) in the area searched. This estimate is about twice the number previously estimated in the period 1980-1985, due mainly, we believe, to our greater search effort, although we cannot discount an increase in the breeding population. The number of breeding pairs has declined since 1985 in some localities, suggesting a population decline or movement of pairs away from these sites. We recommend annual monitoring of a random sample of known breeding pairs until causes for the species rarity have been limited and no evidence of population decline is detected, followed by monitoring at least every five years until the species can be removed from the endangered list.

1135,2740,Contest versus scramble competition for mates: The composition and spatial structure of a population of gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) in North-west Madagascar,"The modes of intrasexual competition interacting in many dispersed societies of nocturnal solitary foragers are still poorly understood. In this study we investigate the spatial structure within a free-living population of gray mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) in order to test for the first time the predictions from two contrasting models of male intrasexual competition on the population level. The contest competition model predicts an uneven distribution of the sexes in a population nucleus with a female biased sex ratio in the center and a male biased sex ratio in the periphery. In contrast the scramble competition model predicts males and females being distributed evenly throughout their habitat with a constant sex ratio. Nine capture/recapture periods within three consecutive mating seasons revealed a continuous male biased sex ratio in the adult population with even trapping rates for the sexes. The male biased sex ratio could either be explained with postnatal female biased mortality or with a male biased natal sex ratio. This male biased sex ratio was apparent in all parts of the study site, indicating that the population was not subdivided into a female biased core and a male biased periphery. Furthermore, the majority of adult males have been captured at the same as or in vicinity to females. Consequently, a large proportion of males had spatial access to females during the mating season. No signs of monopolization of females by certain dominant males could be detected. These data support the predictions from the scramble competition model and the concept of a promiscuous mating system for this species."
1136,2513,"Population size, distribution and habitat selection of the white-tailed eagle &lt;i&gt;Haliaeetus albicilla&lt;/i&gt; in the alluvial wetlands of Croatia","From 2003-2006, research on the breeding distribution of the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) was conducted in Croatia in order to assess the size of the national population. In 125 locations, clear signs of breeding activity were found. An additional 10 presumably active territories were detected but it was not possible to locate the exact position of the nests and confirm the breeding. Based on this, it is concluded that the national breeding population is not less than 135 breeding pairs. The present distribution can be compared with previous reports with the exception of the area along the Ilova and Lonja rivers that have never been reported as an important breeding site. Analysis of the characteristics of 138 nest positions as well as preferences/avoidance of specific structural features were performed. The results showed that white-tailed eagles prefer to build their nests on pedunculate oaks, narrow-leafed ash and white poplars with the greatest preference for mature trees with a diameter above 92.5 cm. The minimal distance between two active pairs was 348 meters. More than 50% of the national population breed less than two km from a large water area and 95% of the population less than four km. More than 95% of the population breed at altitudes lower than 140 m above sea level and are further than one km away from the nearest human settlement, regardless of the availability of forests. According to several parameters (distance to a large water area, elevation, forest presence, distance to the nearest settlement, distance to highways and railways) geographic information system (GIS) helped to determine potential white-tailed eagle breeding areas.

1137,3041,"Possible decline of an American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) population on Turneffe Atoll, Belize","Surveys of the American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) in Turneffe Atoll, Belize; over the last decade have suggested that populations remain stable but are increasingly threatened; by habitat loss, particularly human development of critical nesting beaches. In May, June and July; 2008 we used a combination of spotlight surveys and nest counts to evaluate the current status of; C. acutus populations in Turneffe Atoll. A total of 23 C. acutus was observed along 46.6 Km of; survey route (0.49 crocodiles/Km) during spotlight surveys in May, and 8 crocodiles were observed; along 45.3 Km of survey route (0.18 crocodiles/Km) during late June-early July, yielding an overall; 2008 encounter rate of 0.34 crocodiles/Km. This encounter rate was significantly lower than that; reported for surveys conducted in 2002. Two recently hatched nests, both on the same beach, were; found during nest counts; no nests were found on other beaches known to have routinely yielded; nests in the past. The number of nests found in this study is 4- to 10-fold lower than those reported; from 1994 to 2004, suggesting a reduction in breeding females in the Turneffe Atoll crocodile; population. Development of two important nesting beaches on Blackbird Cay since 2004 has likely; rendered these habitats unsuitable for future nesting. The combination of low crocodile encounter; rates, reduced nesting activity and human alteration of known nesting beaches observed in this; study suggests a possible decline in the C. acutus population in Turneffe Atoll. Continued population; assessments will be essential in monitoring the status of C. acutus in Turneffe Atoll, and immediate; management and conservation efforts should be made to protect beaches on Blackbird, Calabash,; and Northern Cays to provide critical nesting habitat for crocodiles."

1139,3970,"What drives current population trends in forest birds - forest quantity, quality or climate? A large-scale analysis from northern Europe","Changes in forestry practices and on-going climate change may both have large impacts on forest bird; populations. However, large-scale analyses of the effects of temporal changes in forest structure on forest; bird numbers are largely lacking. We compared temporal trends from two Swedish nationwide long-term; monitoring schemes, the Swedish Bird Survey (19982015) and the Swedish National Forestry Inventory; (19832014), giving representative values for both forest and bird changes over an area of 35 million ha.; Since 1998 the total area of middle-aged and mature forest increased by 6.4%. In parallel, several forest; structures potentially beneficial to birds (dead wood, retention trees on clear cuts, multi-layer forests, old; forest and broadleaved forest) increased somewhat in abundance, most likely as a result of legislation; changes and increasing areas under forest certification schemes. Summer temperatures also increased,; with warm summers dominating since 2002. In 19982015, the population sizes of 58 forest bird species; on average increased, as did the number of species observed per route, with no general difference; between forest specialists (16 species) and generalists (42 species). However, from around 2005, the positive; trends in bird numbers and many forest structures have levelled out. An analysis of species population; trends in relation to a measure of climate sensitivity (Species Temperature Index, STI) suggested; that forest birds, just like Swedish birds in general, have indeed been affected by a warming climate.; But given their STI, forest birds on average had more positive trends than non-forest birds, suggesting; that other factors than climate have affected them positively. Strong candidate factors are the documented; changes in forest quality and quantity. Whereas our data and analyses are correlational, and; no firm conclusions on causality therefore can be drawn, it is reasonable to assume that the recent; increases in forest quantity, forest quality, and summer temperatures, all have contributed to the general; increase in forest bird numbers in Sweden. But the relative contribution of these driving forces remains to; be determined. When it comes to the potentially positive effects of improving forest quality in terms of; increases in old forest, stratification, retention trees and dead wood, it is noteworthy that many of the; positive trends in forest structures since the mid-1990s seem to have ceased recently."
1140,4605,Drought Facilitates Species Invasions in an Urban Stream: Results From a Long-Term Study of Tropical Island Fish Assemblage Structure,"The natural flow regime is a key regulator of the dynamics of stream communities and ecosystem processes. Native fish assemblages are evolutionarily adapted to their local flow regime. In the Caribbean, streams are vulnerable to changes in climate that will alter their flow regimes. We assessed long-term patterns in fish assemblages (2008-2016) in an urban stream in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We hypothesized that drought periods would result in negative effects on native fish species and positive effects on introduced species. Fish assemblages were sampled annually from 2008 to 2016 by backpack electrofishing, with additional sampling during 2015, which was a drought year. Cumulative dry season discharge was consistently over 300 m3/s from 2008 to 2013, except from 2014 to 2016 when it dropped below 170 m3/s. Thirteen species were found, including most native species reported for Puerto Rico and introduced species (e.g., Cichlids, Poeciliids, and Loracariids). Native species were dominant in abundance during most years, except during drought and post-drought sampling events when introduced species became dominant. Introduced species increased in richness with time from less than two species between 2008 and 2013 to seven in 2015. The increase in introduced species was mostly attributed to the appearance of several species of cichlids toward the end of the study. Cluster analysis divided the data set in two groups: drought and non-drought sampling events. Introduced cichlids and the native A. monticola accounted for more than 60% of assemblage dissimilarity. Fish assemblage abundance and richness were negatively related to several components of stream hydrology (e.g., cumulative daily stream discharge, the number of major floods). A significant change in size over time was found for the native A. monticola, which decreased in size during the drought period. Overall, our study documents drought-facilitated invasions by several aggressive and highly ecologically competitive species, highlights the importance of the natural flow regime as a source of environmental resilience to invasions in tropical island streams, and provides an example of how climate change has and will likely continue to alter Caribbean stream fish assemblages."
1141,1527,Influence of local and large-scale weather events and timing of breeding on tropical roseate tern reproductive parameters,"We analysed the effects of local- (sea-surface temperature [SST] and windspeed) and large- (multivariate El Niño index) scale weather conditions and timing of breeding on reproductive parameters of tropical roseate terns Sterna dougallii on Aride Island, Seychelles, using up to 17 years of data. The size of the breeding population and initiation of breeding were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with both SST and the multivariate El Niño index for the laying season (May-June). It is the first time that an El Ninño index obtained for the Pacific Ocean is shown to be correlated with reproductive parameters of seabirds in the Indian Ocean. Hatching success decreased significantly with later initiation of breeding. Virtually no chicks fledged when breeding started in June (40% of the years monitored). We suggest that oceanographic conditions over a relatively large scale have an influence on tern arrival date to the breeding grounds and that SST around the breeding colony influences the number of birds that attempt to breed. Despite the influence of factors such as predatory fish on food availability, this influence appears to be overridden by the importance of weather events and oceanographic conditions, which are likely to determine marine productivity. This study suggests that ecosystem-level phenomena appear to be important in shaping the population dynamics of tropical roseate terns."
1142,3384,Long-term responses of ecosystem components to stand thinning in young lodgepole pine forest. I. Population dynamics of Northern flying squirrels and Red squirrels,"A new paradigm in forest management is managing second-growth forests to accelerate development of structural characteristics associated with late-seral forests. A key uncertainty is whether those wildlife species associated with these structural characteristics will respond positively to their development in thinned young seral forests. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that population dynamics (abundance, breeding condition, and survival) of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) would be maintained at levels recorded in old-growth forests by large-scale pre-commercial thinning of young (17-27 years old) lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests. Replicated study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three young pine stands thinned to densities of ∼500 (low), ∼1000 (medium), and ∼2000 (high) stems/ha, with unthinned (4300-7600 stems/ha) and old-growth stands for comparison. Populations of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus were sampled intensively from 2000 to 2002 corresponding to 12-14 years after thinning. Abundance of G. sabrinus was significantly higher in the high-density stand and lowest in the low-density and unthinned stands. Intermediate densities were found in the medium-density and old-growth stands. Adult male body mass was significantly greater in old-growth than high-density stands. We failed to detect significant differences among treatments for recruitment, movement, and survival for G. sabrinus and all parameters measured for T. hudsonicus. Survival increased significantly in 2002 from previous years for G. sabrinus, while survival decreased significantly for T. hudsonicus during this period. Our results support the hypothesis that population dynamics of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus would be maintained at levels recorded in old-growth forests by large-scale pre-commercial thinning of young lodgepole pine forests. Abundance of G. sabrinus in high-density stands exceeded levels recorded in old-growth stands. "
1143,3228,Effects of food and den-site supplementation on populations of Glaucomys sabrinus and Tamiasciurus douglasii,"We examined effects of food and den site supplementation on population dynamics of Glaucomys sabrinus and Tamiasciurus douglasii in mature second-growth forests in British Columbia, Canada. We tested the hypothesis that populations of these squirrels were limited by abundance of food, not den sites. Populations were sampled intensively from June 1996 to March 1999 on controls and grids supplemented with food, food and nest boxes, and nest boxes. Analysis of variance revealed no differences in movement, abundance, recruitment, body mass of males, and percentage of males breeding among treatments for G. sabrinus or T. douglasii. Survival of G. sabrinus was not significantly different during pretreatment, but was significantly higher on grids supplemented with food during posttreatment. Occupancy rate of nest boxes in stands supplemented with nest boxes and food was 6- to 12-fold higher than in stands supplemented with nest boxes only. G. sabrinus occupied the majority of the nest boxes. We concluded that G. sabrinus used nest boxes readily but their populations were not limited by availability of den sites; availability of food appeared to have a significant effect on their populations. T. douglasii was not limited by availability of food or den sites during our study."
1144,3596,"Relationships between adult population size, recruitment and year-class strength in a labrid fish in the Mediterranean Sea","The influence of distinct demographic factors on determining population size in a littoral nesting fish (Symphodus roissali) was studied. Differences in the overall abundances were studied at three sites in the NW Mediterranean Sea for three years, to examine whether: 1) the adult population determined the number of successful nests; 2) the number of successful nests determined recruitment levels; 3) recruitment levels were subsequently related to the number of young of the year (YOY) joining the population after the recruitment period; and 4) the YOY value determined the size of the year class 1 cohort in the following year's adult reproductive population. The results show that there was a significant relationship between the number of spawners and the number of successful nests. However, the number of successful nests does not always correlate well with recruitment level. Furthermore, recruitment levels are not good indicators of the Young of the Year (measured three months after settlement) in number joining the populations, though YOY in number was related to the strength of the year class joining the adult reproductive population the following year. Therefore, the magnitude of the recruitment and probably the size of the adult population did not determine the year-class strength in S. roissali. "
1145,3747,"Species-specific population trends detected for penguins, gulls and cormorants over 20 years in sub-Antarctic Fuegian Archipelago","Understanding the dynamics and causes of population trends are essential for seabird conservation. Long-term studies of seabirds at high-latitude (Antarctic, sub-Antarctic and Arctic) regions have shown contrasting species-specific trends in population size in response to climate change and anthropogenic pressures. We have studied for the last 20 years (1992-2012) the population trends of seven seabird species that breed in the Beagle Channel, south-eastern Tierra del Fuego and at Staten Island, a sub-Antarctic region in southern Argentina. The numbers of Magellanic and Gentoo Penguins increased significantly since 1992 (by >15 % year-1). In comparison, the populations of Imperial Cormorants, Dolphin Gulls and Kelp Gulls increased at slower rates (<5 % year-1), while the Rock Cormorant population even decreased by 1.3 % year-1. At Staten Island, the numbers of Rockhopper Penguins decreased by 24 % between the censuses of 1998 and 2010, whereas the population of Magellanic Penguins increased by 227 % during the same period. Over the study period, air and sea-surface temperatures remained stable in our study area, suggesting that the detected population changes are not driven by the climate. This finding contrasts with the detected links between increasing temperature trends and seabird population changes reported from Antarctic and Arctic regions. The level of tourism and size of the permanent human population has increased in the Beagle Channel area during the last 20 years and could be responsible for the increase of gull populations. The seabird species that received the highest number of visitors (Imperial Cormorants and penguin species) seem to be adapted or at least indifferent to pressures exerted by tourism, as their populations increased during the study period. In addition, increasing numbers of seabirds in the area may generally be leading to higher abundances of scavenging species (e.g. gulls). "
1146,1273,"Effects of a Clearcut on a Population of the Mole Salamander, Ambystoma talpoideum, in an Adjacent Unaltered Forest.","A study was performed to analyze the impact of clearcutting on adjacent site on a population pond of mole salamanders (Ambystoma talpoideum) in northwestern Louisiana were conducted. A comparison was made between the number of adults immigrating from the west side that immigrating from the east side of the pond. Chi-square 2 × 3 and 2 × 2 contingency tables were used to determine if the clearcut had any affect on their population. Overall, the clearcut near the study pond affected the population of salamanders by lowering the survival of adults immigrating from the clearcut side of the pond, and displacing adults to the terrestrial habitat on the east side of the pond."
1147,2858,Booming during a bust: Asynchronous population responses of arid zone lizards to climatic variables,"The productivity of arid environments and the reproductive success of vertebrates in these systems, are typically thought to be primarily influenced by rainfall patterns. Data from our 15 year study at an Australian arid zone site reveals asynchronous demographic responses to rainfall and other climatic variables among different lizard species. We show that, in addition to precipitation, key demographic rates (fecundity, recruitment and survival) are correlated strongly with temporal variability in temperature, during and prior to the breeding season, and also to the density of sympatric lizard species. There were nine-fold fluctuations through time in the relative abundance of two similar-sized Ctenotus species, and asynchronous recruitment success and survival among other species, despite the absence of direct anthropogenic affects Understanding the drivers and magnitude of the substantial natural variability in arid-zone lizard assemblages is integral to predicting and interpreting their responses to future land use or climate-change scenarios.

1148,1294,"Breeding Pond Fidelity in the Common Toad, Bufo-Bufo","Two independent studies of adult common toad, Bufo bufo, movements between different spawning ponds/populations both within and between years were made in England and Sweden during the spring breeding periods of1987–1990. The results of the two studies were subsequently combined since they were found to be complementary. In addition, in England during 1984 and 1985, large numbers of ‘toadlets’ were marked so that they could be identified if recaptured as breeding adults. The degree of relocation between ponds was negatively correlated to the distance between ponds. The proportion of both males and females that moved between ponds within a particular year was significantly less than the proportion relocating between years. In any year, between 79% and 96% of adults that survived to breed the following year, returned to the original pond. Similarly, of the toadlets marked during1984–85, 81% of the males that subsequently returned as breeding adults were captured in their pond of origin. Isolation, in relation to both population dynamics and population genetics, is defined and its implications for the management of common toad populatins discussed. "
1149,2353,Are snake populations in widespread decline?,"Long-term studies have revealed population declines in fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. In birds, and particularly amphibians, these declines are a global phenomenon whose causes are often unclear. Among reptiles, snakes are top predators and therefore a decline in their numbers may have serious consequences for the functioning of many ecosystems. Our results show that, of 17 snake populations (eight species) from the UK, France, Italy, Nigeria and Australia, 11 have declined sharply over the same relatively short period of time with five remaining stable and one showing signs of a marginal increase. Although the causes of these declines are currently unknown, we suspect that they are multi-faceted (such as habitat quality deterioration, prey availability), and with a common cause, e.g. global climate change, at their root."
1150,4252,The Response of Anolis Lizards to Hurricane-Induced Habitat Changes in a Puerto Rican Rain Forest,"The abundance and distribution of anoline lizards were investigated in tabonuco forest in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico before and for 13 mo following Hurricane Hugo. The drastic reduction in canopy structure immediately following the hurricane confined anole activity to the lower few meters of the forest. Anolis stratulus, a canopy species, responded to changes in the distribution of suitable habitat structure while A. gundlachi, a forest interior species, apparently responded to changes in microclimate. One year posthurricane, A. stratulus had begun reinvasion of the forest canopy, and relative abundances of species at ground level proceeded toward prehurricane values. One year posthurricane, the total anoline minimum density at ground level was still substantially lower than prehurricane levels."
1151,982,Demography and conservation of western European Bonelli's eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus populations,"The basic demographic parameters of six Bonelli's eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus populations in Spain and France were calculated from field data obtained in the last 15 years. Average annual productivity ranged from 0.36 to 1.24 young/pair and average annual adult survival from 84% to 96%. Preadult survival (from fledging to recruitment) was estimated at 10%. All the populations were declining at annual rates ranging from -7.3 to -1.1%. Although no statistically significant disagreement was observed between the predictions of a Leslie matrix model fitted to the population parameters and the real trends, some populations declined faster and others more slowly than expected. These differences were interpreted as a result of differential emigration, recruitment rates or preadult survival not accounted for by the model. Since the intrinsic population growth rate was about four times less sensitive to changes in preadult survival than to changes in adult survival, and about ten times less sensitive to changes in fecundity and predispersal survival, conservation efforts must be primarily directed towards increasing adult and preadult survival. Power line casualties and direct persecution must be eliminated in order to reduce mortality. Priorities on research should address dispersal, mortality and habitat relationships involving these two parameters. Monitoring should be extended to other populations."
1152,2848,Recovery of the Endangered giant otter Pteronura brasiliensis on the Yavari-Mirin and Yavari Rivers: a success story for CITES,"The giant otter Pteronura brasiliensis was hunted almost to extinction in the Peruvian Amazon during a period of professional trade in wild animal skins during 1920-1973. In 1973 the Department of Agriculture of Peru (INRENA) prohibited commercial hunting in the Peruvian Amazon, and the giant otter was included in Appendix I of CITES. From 1973 to 2004 giant otter populations experienced a slow recovery in numerous rivers of the Peruvian Amazon. Here, we report the population growth of the giant otter on the Yavari-Mirin and Yavari Rivers in northeast Peru. The first evaluations of giant otter populations in these rivers, in which no individuals were sighted, were in 1992-1993. During surveys in 1996 and 1997 two individuals were sighted. In 2001, 19 individuals were sighted and in 2003 and 2004, 41 individuals were observed. This increase demonstrates a slow recovery and shows that the population has not yet reached its carrying capacity. The prohibition of international trade in otter skins by CITES, supported by INRENA, helped the population recover and was important in the conservation of this species."
1153,1400,"Biases in estimating population size from an aerial census: A case study in the Kruger National Park, South Africa.","In the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, aerial census data for approximately 15 herbivore species were collected from 1981 to 1993 using a total area count, strip transect method. No estimates of bias or precision error were obtained for the census data. Visibility bias, however, has been shown to be a primary source of error in aerial census data collected using methods similar to the KNP's. Starfield argues that a pragmatic modelling approach can be used to understand the importance of uncollected data and improve data collection strategies. Following this pragmatic approach, we develop a simple, deterministic model to estimate the potential range of bias in the KNP census data. Sources of visibility bias considered in our model include undercounting detected herds and failing to detect small herds. We apply the model to data collected for impala, zebra, wildebeest and waterbuck, because these species represent a range of potential censusing challenges. The model suggests that visibility bias represents a major source of error in the KNP census data. In particular, the model indicates that visibility bias may confound comparisons among species or comparisons of a particular species' abundance among years, under different environmental conditions, or in different habitat types."
1154,3322,"Patterns of distribution and abundance of Greater snow geese on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada 1983-1998","To monitor the numbers and distribution of Greater Snow Geese at the largest breeding colony in the eastern Canadian High Arctic, surveys were conducted on Bylot Island at five year intervals from 1983 to 1998. The surveys were conducted during the brood-rearing period using a stratified sampling procedure and aerial photography. The total number of adult geese increased from 25,500 (SE 2582) in 1983 to 69,500 (SE 8645) in 1993 (a year of exceptionally high breeding effort and breeding success) before dropping slightly in 1998. The number of goslings also increased from 26,500 (SE 2320) in 1983 to 86,500 (SE 8147) in 1993, and also dropped slightly in 1998. In years of high breeding success (1983 and 1993) the adult population on Bylot Island represented 14% of the entire world population of Greater Snow Geese. The adult population on Bylot Island between 1983 and 1998 showed an average annual rate of increase of 7%, similar to the 9% increase recorded for the entire population. Brood densities varied from a low of 0.8 broods km-2 in the poorest quality habitats in 1983 to 29.9 broods km-2 in the best habitats in 1993, but an increasing trend was evident in all habitat strata over the course of the study. A large proportion (63%) of the surface area of the colony accommodated only very low brood densities in 1983, but by 1993 the proportion occupied by such low densities had been reduced to 29%. It is concluded that the increase in goose numbers and the spread of higher brood densities over a larger portion of the colony are indications that the carrying capacity of the Island has not yet been reached."
1155,4164,Analysis of bycatch in the South African midwater trawl fishery for horse mackerel Trachurus capensis based on observer data,"The South African midwater trawl fishery targets adult horse mackerel Trachurus capensis. The bulk of the catch is taken by a single freezer-trawler, the biggest fishing vessel operating in South African waters. As fishing takes place off the south coast in ecologically sensitive areas, there are concerns about the potential impacts of this fishing operation on non-target species. Fishing behaviour and bycatch of this fishery from 2004 to 2014 were investigated by analysing observer records with regard to catch composition, volume and temporal and spatial patterns. The midwater trawl fishery was estimated to have caught 25 415 tonnes annually, with a bycatch of 6.9% of the total catch, by weight. There are species overlaps with various fisheries, namely the demersal trawl, small-pelagic, line, shark longline and squid fisheries, yet the total bycatch estimates from this fishery are generally small relative to catches taken in the target fisheries. Bycatch species with the highest average annual catches were chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, redeye roundherring Etrumeus whiteheadi, ribbonfish Lepidopus caudatus and hake Merluccius spp. Large-fauna bycatch species included sunfish Mola mola as well as a number of CITES II- and IUCN-listed species, such as Cape fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus, dusky shark Carcharhinus obscurus, smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena and thresher sharks Alopias spp. The 97.9% observer coverage is high and the 6.9% bycatch rate low compared to other South African fisheries; however, due to the large size of the individual hauls (average of 46.3 t), the average sampling rate of 1.56% is low. Our analyses suggest that bycatch in the South African midwater trawl fishery has been lower than in other South African fisheries and similar fisheries elsewhere, but due to the combination of high catch volumes and low sampling rates, estimation errors for rare species are high and there is a substantial risk of incidental unmonitored bycatch of rare large fauna and aggregations of small fauna. This could be mitigated by spatio-temporal management of this fishery, to avoid fishing in high-risk areas, and the introduction of an electronic monitoring programme."
1156,783,"Population status and structure of mountain nyala in the Bale Mountains National Park, Ethiopia","The study on the population status and structure of mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni) was carried out in the Bale Mountains National Park, Ethiopia during the wet and dry seasons of 2000/2001. Total counts were carried out in an area of 13.1 km2. The count ranged between 682 and 732 individuals. Females comprised 62.9% while males 27.4%.The calf ratio was 9.7%. The group structure of the animals varied with season. Large herds were frequently observed during the wet season and smaller groups during the dry season. Group size changed seasonally. In both seasons, 7-12 individuals were the frequent group size formation. The maximum group (62) was observed during the wet season. The population trend of the animal from 1975 to 1990 indicated a recovery and increase. But between 1990 and 1995 the population showed a continuous and steep decline. However, between 1995 and 2000 the population trend showed a better condition when compared with the previous years."
1157,3374,Effects of earlier sea ice breakup on survival and population size of Polar bears in Western Hudson Bay,"Some of the most pronounced ecological responses to climatic warming are expected to occur in polar marine regions, where temperature increases have been the greatest and sea ice provides a sensitive mechanism by which climatic conditions affect sympagic (i.e., with ice) species. Population-level effects of climatic change, however, remain difficult to quantify. We used a flexible extension of Cormack-Jolly-Seber capture-recapture models to estimate population size and survival for polar bears (Ursus maritimus), one of the most ice-dependent of Arctic marine mammals. We analyzed data for polar bears captured from 1984 to 2004 along the western coast of Hudson Bay and in the community of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. The Western Hudson Bay polar bear population declined from 1,194 (95% CI = 1,020-1,368) in 1987 to 935 (95% CI = 794-1,076) in 2004. Total apparent survival of prime-adult polar bears (5-19 yr) was stable for females (0.93; 95% CI = 0.91-0.94) and males (0.90; 95% CI = 0.88-0.91). Survival of juvenile, subadult, and senescent-adult polar bears was correlated with spring sea ice breakup date, which was variable among years and occurred approximately 3 weeks earlier in 2004 than in 1984. We propose that this correlation provides evidence for a causal association between earlier sea ice breakup (due to climatic warming) and decreased polar bear survival. It may also explain why Churchill, like other communities along the western coast of Hudson Bay, has experienced an increase in human-polar bear interactions in recent years. Earlier sea ice breakup may have resulted in a larger number of nutritionally stressed polar bears, which are encroaching on human habitations in search of supplemental food. Because western Hudson Bay is near the southern limit of the species' range, our findings may foreshadow the demographic responses and management challenges that more northerly polar bear populations will experience if climatic warming in the Arctic continues as projected."
1158,3393,Relative importance of human activities and climate driving Common murre population trends in the Northwest Atlantic,"Seabird populations are affected by environmental and anthropogenic influences on a global scale. Many population-level responses to climate change have been shown, yet few studies have addressed the additive and/or relative impact of environmental and anthropogenic influences on seabird populations. Using a mixed model approach, we analyzed the trends in plot counts of common murres (Uria aalge) from a Low Arctic colony at Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland, across 26 years (1980-2006). We tested for associations between population change and various environmental and anthropogenic covariates: water temperature, winter North Atlantic Oscillation, hunting mortality, oil pollution, by-catch in fishing gear, and visitor disturbance. The number of murres occupying central plots decreased from 1980 to 1989 and increased from 1990 to 2006. Annual changes in the population were negatively associated with the estimated number of murres killed in the Newfoundland murre hunt and the high numbers killed in the early 1980s likely caused the observed population decline. The large number of gillnets set in Newfoundland waters during the 1980s, and associated incidence of drowning through by-catch, probably also contributed to the observed decline. Though a centennially significant cold-water perturbation in 1991 forced a regime shift in pelagic food webs, the effect of ocean climate variability on the population was not obvious. We conclude that management efforts should focus on assessing and mitigating the effects of human-induced influences and consider the potential additive effects of climate change. "
1159,4165,"Decadal trends in shark catches and effort from the New South Wales, Australia, Shark Meshing Program 1950–2010","The New South Wales (NSW) government has operated a program of netting beaches for the protection of swimmers and surfers against shark attack since 1937 in Sydney, and since 1949 in Newcastle and Wollongong. The scope and directives of the Shark Meshing Program have remained constant since its inception, with operational modifications in net specifications in 1972, changes in spatial deployment in 1972, 1987 and 1992, and the elimination of winter netting since 1989. This markedly increased meshing effort in 1972, and again in 1987. In the present study, we examine the trends in catch and effort for the period from 19501951 to 20092010 over this 200-km section of the NSW coast. Significant temporal trends in species, size and sex composition are described herein. Catches were consistently dominated by three shark taxa, hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna spp.), whaler sharks (Carcharhinus spp.) and Australian angel sharks (Squatina australis), although their relative contributions to catches varied over time. Catch per unit effort has significantly declined for five of the most abundant shark taxa over the study period, increasing only for a single taxon, the sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). Catches of larger, potentially dangerous white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) saw fewer large animals being caught over time. This pattern was not observed across other taxa. Four different monthly trends were observed in landings of the most abundant eight taxa, reflecting differences in the biology of the catch species. The current study also provides useful information on catches and sizes of grey nurse (Carcharias taurus) and white sharks before and after their protection in NSW waters in 1984 and 1998, respectively."
1160,3079,"Continuing decline of Eastern Curlew, Numenius madagascariensis, in Tasmania","Regular counts of Eastern Curlew, Numenius madagascariensis, in Tasmania indicate that they have declined by over 65% in Tasmania since the 1950s. The declines have been noted at many of the sites regularly used in Tasmania, and there is no indication of the birds moving to areas interstate. The reasons for the decline are not known; however, they may include habitat destruction and disturbance in Tasmania or on the migration routes, or hunting pressure in their breeding grounds or migration routes. There is an urgent need to protect the species' roosting and foraging grounds in Tasmania and throughout its migration routes."
1161,1571,"Management and conservation of the Harbour seal, Phoca vitulina, population in the international Wadden sea area","A population assessment of the harbour seal in the international Wadden Sea area was carried out. The results show that the populations in the different areas must be considered as one entity. Therefore management and conservation measurements should be placed in an international context. Because of the low pup production in the Dutch area the survival of a harbour seal population in the Dutch Wadden Sea depends on migration from the adjacent areas as long as adverse environmental factors, i.e. pollution and disturbance, are not under control. "
1162,2799,Population development of Harbour seals Phoca vitulina in the Wadden Sea after the 1988 virus epizootic,"The mortality as a result of the 1988 virus epizootic amongst harbour seals Phoca vitulina in the North and Baltic Seas is estimated at 60% in the entire Wadden Sea. In the years 1989-1994, a prosperous recovery of the population has been observed which is reflected in a high post-epizootic rate of increase. The average annual rate of increase for the entire area was 16%, highest in The Netherlands (average 21%) and lowest in Denmark (average 10%). This rate of increase is significantly higher than in the pre-epizootic period 1976-1987, when the population increased at a rate of around 9% per year. The difference is partly attributed to a considerably lower initial juvenile mortality after the epizootic. The present first-year mortality is statistically significantly lower than in the 1970s. It is about equal in all regions and estimated at approximately 40%, whereas it was approximately 65% in the 1970s. The post-epizootic reproductive rate in The Netherlands is significantly higher: 21% on average, against 13% before 1988; it is also higher in Niedersachsen (21 vs. 16%), but lower in Schleswig-Holstein (19 vs. 23%), while in Denmark it has not changed (both 17%). It is hypothesised that the improved reproductive rate in The Netherlands might be a result of selective mortality during the epidemic, which within the adult female segment would have predominantly affected those not reproducing. It is emphasised that though the population is recovering well, its size of almost 8800 animals in 1994 is still only one quarter of an estimated reference figure of 37000 seals around 1900. How long the recovery will continue at its present rate depends on environmental conditions in the area, such as pollution, disturbance and food resources; nor can a recurrent flickering of the epidemic be excluded."
1163,3295,"Arctic foxes, lemmings and Canada goose nest survival at Cape Churchill, Manitoba","We examined factors influencing Canada Goose (Branta canadensis interior) annual nest success, including the relative abundance of collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx richardsoni), arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) den occupancy, nest density, and spring phenology using data collected during annual Canada Goose breeding area surveys at Cape Churchill, Manitoba. Nest density and arctic fox den occupancy strongly influenced Canada Goose nest success. High nest density resulted in higher nest success and high den occupancy reduced nest success. Nest success was not influenced by lemming abundance in the current or previous year as predicted by the ""bird-lemming"" hypothesis. Reducing arctic fox abundance through targeted management increased nest survival of Canada Geese; a result that further emphasizes the importance of arctic fox as nest predators in this system. The spatial distribution of nest predators, at least for dispersed-nesting geese, may be most important for nest survival, regardless of the abundance of small mammals in the local ecosystem. Further understanding of the factors influencing the magnitude and variance in arctic fox abundance in this region, and the spatial scale at which these factors are realized, is necessary to fully explain predator-prey-alternative prey dynamics in this system.

1164,4380,"Status, distribution and long-term changes in the waterbird community wintering in Doñana, south–west Spain","The Guadalquivir Marshes or Doñana wetland complex is the most important wintering site for migratory waterbirds in the Mediterranean region. However, there is a lack of previous information on the status of different species in this area. Using monthly aerial counts conducted from 1978 to 2005, we analysed the size of wintering populations of 21 waterbird species, their distribution within the Guadalquivir Marshes, and their long-term population trends. We used Underhill indices to replace missing values and to correct for flocks of unidentified ducks. Based on long-term means, we identified 16 species whose populations at Doñana exceed 1% of the biogeographical flyway population. For at least 1 month of the year, mean counts were around 10% of the flyway population for six species. The natural, temporary marshes of Doñana National Park were particularly important for Anatidae, ricefields for gulls, white storks and grey herons, fish ponds for flamingos, cormorants and avocets, and salt pans for shelduck. Four Anatidae species have undergone long-term declines and eight non-Anatidae have undergone long-term increases. Population trends were related with trophic guild, migratory status and habitat use. Winter visitors and herbivorous species showed more negative trends than resident, omnivorous-carnivorous species. Those species concentrated in strictly-protected natural marshes have tended to decline. The surface area of ricefields and fish ponds has increased over the study period, and bird species concentrated in these artificial wetlands have tended to increase. This raises questions about the value of waterbirds as flagship or umbrella species for wetland conservation. "
1165,2952,Protected areas host important remnants of marine turtle nesting stocks in the Dominican Republic,"Nesting by marine turtles in the Caribbean has declined considerably, mainly because of human exploitation, but there has previously been no monitoring in the Dominican Republic. We present the first detailed assessment of the status of marine turtle nesting in the country, based on surveys during 2006-2010. Nesting populations of hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata and leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea are of regional importance and the green turtle Chelonia mydas is still present, although nesting in low numbers. The two main nesting sites are within protected areas: the Jaragua National Park in the south-west, important for leatherback turtles (mean of 126 nests per season), and Del Este National Park on Saona Island in the south-east, principally for hawksbill turtles (mean of 100 nests per season). Comparison with historical data suggests all rookeries are profoundly reduced in size. Although the main nesting beaches are within protected areas, illegal egg-take and meat consumption continues there, and also elsewhere in the country. "
1166,3748,Population Trends of a Mixed-Species Colony of Humboldt and Magellanic Penguins in Southern Chile after Establishing a Protected Area,"Worldwide marine protected areas (MPAs) have been designated to protect marine resources, including top predators such as seabirds. There is no conclusive information on whether protected areas can improve population trends of seabirds when these are further exploited as tourist attractions, an activity that has increased in past decades. Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) and Magellanic Penguins (S. magellanicus) breed sympatrically on Pu&#241;ihuil Islets, two small coastal islands off the west coast of Chilo&#233; Island (41&#176; S) in southern Chile that are subject to exploitation for tourism. Our goal was to compare the population size of the mixed colony of Humboldt and Magellanic Penguins before and after protection from unregulated tourism and freely roaming goats in 1997. For this purpose, two censuses were conducted in 2004 and 2008, and the numbers compared with those obtained in 1997 by other authors. The proportion of occupied, unoccupied, and collapsed/flooded burrows changed between years; there were 68% and 34% fewer collapsed burrows in 2004 and 2008, respectively, than in 1997. For the total number of burrows of both species, we counted 48% and 63% more burrows in 2004 and 2008, respectively, than in 1997. We counted 13% more burrows of Humboldt Penguins in 2008 than in 1997, and for Magellanic Penguins, we estimated a 64% increase in burrows in 2008. Presumably, this was as a result of habitat improvement attributable to the exclusion of tourists and the removal of goats from the islets. Although tourist visits to the islets are prohibited, tourism activities around the colonies are prevalent and need to be taken into account to promote appropriate management."
1167,2897,Influence of space use on fitness and the reintroduction success of the Laysan teal,"Translocation is an important tool for wildlife conservation and biodiversity restoration, but an inefficient one because of the unpredictability of success. Predictors of success such as habitat quality of the release site and number of individuals released have been identified, but the dynamics of successful translocations remain poorly understood. In particular, little is known about the relationship of individual post-release movements to population establishment. In 2004, Laysan teal Anas laysanensis were reintroduced by translocating 20 wild birds from Laysan Island to Midway Atoll. Twenty-two additional wild founders were brought the next year. We monitored the survival, reproductive success and movements of the 42 translocated individuals and their offspring for 4 years. Additionally, we monitored population size from 2004 to 2010. Unlike most translocations, we did not observe elevated post-release mortality despite flight-feather trimming to prevent immediate dispersal off-island: first year survival was >90% and survival rates until 2009 were 0.65±0.08 for founding adults. Laysan teal flew between the two main islands of Midway Atoll, and offspring had significantly larger maximum movement distances than founders. We monitored 84 nests and observed a significant, negative relationship of home range size to productivity for founding females. Flightless founders did not show fidelity to their release sites, but had strong fidelity to annual home ranges after attaining flight. Although we observed a component Allee effect on mate-finding, this did not translate into a demographic Allee effect, and generally, the high fitness of founders contributed substantially to successful population establishment. Laysan teal abundance increased linearly until 2009, but showed evidence of population regulation afterwards. The population estimate was 473 (95% confidence interval 439-508) in 2010. On the much larger main Hawaiian Islands, we expect greater post-release movement, a stronger component Allee effect, lower survival and lower reproductive rates because of predation to preclude successful reintroductions of this species to sites without predator management.

1168,1383,"The Chimpanzees of the Budongo Forest: Ecology, Behaviour, and Conservation.","Chimpanzees have never been more threatened with extinction than they are today. This book focuses on one chimpanzee group, the Sonso community, living in a tropical rain forest, the Budongo Forest in western Uganda. The book builds up a detailed picture of the forest environment of these apes, their social and behavioural adaptations, and the range of threats they face at the present time. The facts presented in the book summarize the author's own work and that of the many students and colleagues who have worked with the Budongo Forest Project, which the author founded, over the years from 1990 to the present day. Comparisons are made with other chimpanzee field studies. A picture is built up to show the Sonso community living in a complex environment to which it has adapted well. The diet, culture, social behaviour, and social organization of the chimpanzees are described in detail. Focus then shifts to the various dangers they face in the modern context of increasing pressure from local hunters who put snares in the forest, and from a local agribusiness which threatens to engulf the forest. A careful appraisal of the future for these animals is made, ending with a note of hope for their survival if the national organizations that exist to protect them can become more effective."
1169,108,"Habitat, Population Dynamics, and Conservation of the Nilgiri tahr, Hemitragus hylocrius.","In Eravikulam National Park, India, Nilgiri tahr Hemitragus hylocrius frequent the fringes of the grass-covered plateau. The two main types of grassland utilised by tahr were dominated by Eulalia phaeothrix and Andropogon polyptichus. The total wild population of Nilgiri tahr is about 2200. Available evidence suggests that the three largest populations have remained approximately stable in recent years. Annual mortality at Eravikulam NP was estimated to be 44-52% for young, 31-37% for yearlings, and 17-24% for adults. Life expectancy at birth was estimated at 3-3·5 years. There was evidence for mortality incurred by predation, disease, accidents, injury during intraspecific combat, and thermal stress. Relevant to conservation are the short life expectancy of Nilgiri tahr; the need for comparable information on size and structure of all extant populations; and the effect of weather patterns on the temporal distribution of births and census results.

1170,2813,"Eighteen years of saturation tagging data reveal a significant increase in nesting hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) on Long Island, Antigua","Hawksbill sea turtle Eretmochelys imbricata nesting on Long Island, Antigua, West Indies (also known as Jumby Bay) has been monitored since 1987. Although the numbers of nesting females remained relatively constant for the first 11 survey seasons (1987-1997), inclusion of more recent data (1998-2004) in the analysis reveals a statistically significant upward trend. In particular, neophytes have shown a significant upturn in numbers, whereas the remigrant subpopulation has remained stationary. This indicates that recruitment is driving the upward trend in the total number of nesters. Predictive models based on the Poisson distribution suggest that the neophyte subpopulation will continue to grow in size by an average of 10% per annum. Model-based predictions and their limitations are discussed. The Jumby Bay Hawksbill Project, which has monitored and protected nesting hawksbills and their eggs since the project's onset, is one among several factors that may contribute to the recent increase in nesting females."

1172,3282,"The influx of redpolls into Western Europe, 1995/96","Winter 1995/96 saw a huge influx of Common Redpolls Carduelis flammea and Arctic Redpolls C. hornemanni into Britain and Western Europe. Two forms of redpoll were involved, the nominate race of Common Redpoll C.f.flammea ('Mealy Redpoll') and the Eurasian race of Arctic Redpoll C. h. exilipes, and there is no evidence of any arrivals from other than northern Eurasian populations. Three main influxes were recorded in the north and east of Britain. The first two, in early and mid November, were immediately preceded by or coincided with substantial movements through Utsira in southwest Norway, Heligoland off the northwest coast of Germany, and Falsterbo in southern Sweden; the last of the three arrivals occurred in early December and was associated with the onset of very cold weather, but not with large movements farther north and east. On the British east coast, numbers were the largest since 1975. The irruption was absorbed in Britain, and no significant movements were recorded through bird observatories on southern and western coasts. Return spring migration was heavy through southern North Sea sites (which experienced little of the autumn arrival), but was much less apparent farther north."
1173,4166,"Analysis of whale shark Rhincodon typus aggregations near South Ari Atoll, Maldives Archipelago",": We made surveys for whale sharks <i>Rhincodon typus</i> on a total of 99 d from April through June each year from 2006 to 2008 along the southern fringe of the South Ari Atoll, Maldives Archipelago. We recorded the length and sex of each shark observed and made photographs to facilitate repeated identification from their spot patterns using pattern-recognition software. We identified 64 whale sharks from digital photographs taken during 220 sightings over 3 yr. Approx. 87% of those sharks were immature males. The average length of recognisable sharks was 5.98 m (range 2.5 to 10.5 m), significantly shorter than that reported for whale sharks in other aggregations in the Indian Ocean. Our findings suggest that these sharks are either a small proportion of a local population or perhaps an even smaller component of a regional population in the western Indian Ocean. We applied a Lincoln-Petersen closed-population mark-recapture model and a Jolly-Seber open-population model to estimate population size, but found that neither model provided reliable results because key assumptions of each were not met."
1174,1468,Effects of changes in sandeel availability on the reproductive output of seabirds.,"The lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus is a key prey species for many marine birds in the North Sea. This fish is currently the target of the largest single species fishery in the area, and this has led to concern about the potential impact of the fishery on seabirds. There are 2 critical issues: does the breeding success of seabirds depend on sandeel availability and does the fishery reduce sandeel availability to a level at which avian reproductive output is affected? This paper investigates the first question in detail and briefly touches on the second by testing for correlations between productivity, breeding effort and diet in 3 species of seabird with contrasting foraging and dietary characteristics (common guillemot Uria aalge, black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, and European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and an index of availability of 1 group and older sandeels derived from catch per unit effort statistics from the Danish sandeel fishery. Breeding success in all 3 species was significantly reduced when sandeel availability to the fishery in June was low. There was also evidence that the timing of peak sandeel availability influenced reproductive output such that success was lower when availability peaked early. We speculate that these effects are linked to annual variations in sandeel life history events and, in particular, to the onset of burying behaviour of 1+ group fish and the arrival of 0 group sandeels on the seabirds' feeding grounds. Although the timing of these events is unlikely to be directly influenced by the sandeel fishery, since most catches are taken in June, it is possible that the fishery could exacerbate a difficult situation for seabirds by further reducing the biomass of available 1+ group fish. We suggest that this may have occurred in one of the years of the study."
1175,1361,"Demographic Characteristics of Extinction in a Small, Insular Population of House Sparrows in Northern Norway","In conservation ecology there is an urgent need for indicators that can be used to predict the risk of extinction of populations. Identifying extinction-prone populations has been difficult because few data sets on the demographic characteristics of the final stage to extinction are available and because of problems in separating out stochastic effects from changes in the expected dynamics. We documented the demographic changes that occurred during the period prior to extinction of a small island population of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) after the end of permanent human settlement. A mark-recapture analysis revealed that this decline to extinction was mainly due to increased mortality after closure of the last farm that resulted in a negative long-term-specific growth rate. No change occurred in either the structural composition (breeding sex ratio and age distribution) of the population or in female recruitment. No male, however, recruits were produced on the island after the farm closure. Based on a simple, stochastic, density-dependent model we constructed a population prediction interval (PPI) to estimate the time to extinction. The 95% PPI slightly overestimated the time to extinction with large uncertainty in predictions, especially due to the influence of demographic stochasticity and parameter drift. Our results strongly emphasize the importance of access to data on temporal variation that can be used to parameterize simple population models that allow estimation of critical parameters for credible prediction of time to extinction.

1176,2855,Combined impacts of longline fisheries and climate on the persistence of the Amsterdam Albatross Diomedia amsterdamensis,"Incidental capture of seabirds in longline fishing gear is a central issue in the conservation of many long-lived marine species. Despite growing evidence of climate-induced effects on population trends of long-lived species, climate change remains generally overlooked in most risk assessments of seabirds. Because variation in climate may interact with the detrimental effects of bycatch, considering climate is of great importance, especially in the context of ongoing global warming. This paper examines the combined effects of bycatch and climate change on the persistence of one of the world's rarest birds, the Amsterdam Albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis, which has a single population in the upland plateau of Amsterdam Island (Southeast Indian Ocean). Using continuous monitoring from 1983 onwards, we first estimated the relationship between climate and the species' demographic parameters. We then built a stochastic matrix population model to estimate the population growth rate and the probability that the population declines below the level recorded in 1983 of nine breeding pairs under different scenarios involving the joint effects of additional mortality caused by longline fisheries and climate change. The results suggest that the demography of the Amsterdam Albatross is influenced by climate in both breeding and wintering grounds and that these relationships may to some extent compensate for the impact of additive bycatch mortality. However, these compensatory effects would be negligible if the annual additional mortality exceeds around six individuals per year, suggesting that the resumption of longline fishery in the foraging range of the Amsterdam Albatross would rapidly put this species at risk of extinction.

1177,1498,Decline of the Tucuman parrot Amazona tucumana in Argentina: present status and conservation needs,"The Tucumán parrot Amazona tucumana is a rare, Near Threatened species on CITES Appendix I with a restricted range in the tropical and subtropical montane forests of Argentina and Bolivia. We assessed the conservation status of the species in Argentina based on a detailed review of available information and an extensive survey throughout its range. A total of 6,015 individuals were detected in 14 sites, eight of which are new localities. The total number recorded in this study represents less than a third of the number exported from Argentina between 1985 and 1989 (18,641), indicating a significant reduction in population size. Research needs to be extended to additional sites, especially in Bolivia, to assess further the global status of the species, and high priority given to the creation of state and private reserves for the species.

1178,2174,"Temporal and geographic variation in fish communities of lower Cook Inlet, Alaska","Nearshore and shelf fish communities were studied in three areas of lower Cook Inlet, Alaska: the Barren Islands (oceanic and well-mixed waters), Kachemak Bay (mixed oceanic waters with significant freshwater runoff), and Chisik Island (estuarine waters). Fish were sampled with beach seines (n=413 sets) and midwater trawls (n=39 sets). We found that lower Cook Inlet supported a diverse nearshore fish community of at least 52 species. Fifty of these species were caught in Kachemak Bay, 24 at Chisik Island, and 12 at the Barren Islands. Pacific sand lance dominated Barren Islands and Kachemak Bay nearshore habitats, comprising 99% and 71% of total individuals, respectively. The nearshore Chisik Island fish community was not dominated by any one species; instead it exhibited higher diversity. These spatial differences appeared linked to local oceanographic regimes and sediment influx. Analysis of historical data revealed that the nearshore Kachemak Bay fish community changed significantly between 1976 and 1996, showing increased diversity and abundance in several taxa, notably gadids, salmonids, pleuronectids, and sculpins. Decadal differences appeared to be related to large-scale climate changes in the North Pacific. Catches of most taxa peaked in May-August, and were low during other months of the year. Several species were present for only part of the summer. Species composition of seine catches differed significantly between consecutive high and low tides, but not between consecutive sets or years. Midwater trawls took 26 species, 14 of which were present in Kachemak Bay, 19 near Chisik Island, and 7 at the Barren Islands. Community structures in shelf and nearshore waters were similar: diversity was high and abundance low at Chisik Island, whereas a few abundant species dominated at both Kachemak Bay and the Barren Islands. In addition, the low fish abundance near Chisik Island appeared to be related to declining seabird numbers at this colony."
1179,2958,Increases in surgeonfish populations after mass mortality of the sea urchin Diadema antillarum in Panama indicate food limitation,"In 1983/1984, Diadema antillarum suffered mass mortalities throughout its West Atlantic range. Its populations were reduced by 95% and subsequently have failed to recover. These die-offs led to sustained increases in the abundance of soft algae, including types eaten by herbivorous reef fishes. I monitored adult populations of three herbivorous surgeonfishes (Acanthurus coeruleus, A. chirurugus and A. bahianus) between 1978 and 1990, and the recruitment of their pelagic juveniles between 1979 and 1989, on six patch reefs in Panamá. Adult populations of A. coeruleus and A. chirurgus, which largely restrict their feeding to reef substrata, increased by averages of 250 and 160%, respectively, after the die-off of D. antillarum in 1983. No increases occurred in the adult populations of A. bahianus, which often feeds in off-reef habitats unaffected by D. antillarum. Average annual levels of juvenile recruitment of all three surgeonfishes did not differ before and after the die-off. These results support the hypothesis that adult populations of two herbivorous fishes that are strongly reliant on reef algae for food previously were limited by competition with D. antillarum. "
1180,770,Cougar predation and population growth of sympatric mule deer and white-tailed deer,"Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations throughout the west appear to be declining, whereas white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations are increasing. We compared abundance, number of fetuses per female (maternity rate), recruitment, and cause-specific adult (≥1 year old) mortality rate for sympatric mule deer and white-tailed deer in south-central British Columbia to assess population growth for each species. White-tailed deer were three times more abundant (908 ± 152) than mule deer (336 ± 122) (mean ± 1 SE). Fetal rates of white-tailed deer (1.83) were similar to those of mule deer (1.78). There was no statistically significant difference in recruitment of white-tailed deer (56 fawns:100 does) and mule deer (38 fawns:100 does). The annual survival rate for adult white-tailed deer (SWT = 0.81) was significantly higher than that for mule deer (SMD = 0.72). The main cause of mortality in both populations was cougar predation. The lower mule deer survival rate could be directly linked to a higher predation rate (0.17) than for white-tailed deer (0.09). The finite growth rate (λ) was 0.88 for mule deer and 1.02 for white-tailed deer. The disparate survival and predation rates are consistent with the apparent-competition hypothesis."
1181,3651,Namibian and North American sand-diving lizards,"Although similar in physical characteristics, dune ecosystems of the Namibian and North American Deserts have distinctive geological ages, regional climates and microenvironments. Specialist sand-diving lizards have evolved in each system albeit at different tempos and modes of speciation. Meroles anchietae (Lacertidae), and Gerrhosaurus skoogi (Gerrhosauridae) of the Namib Desert, and six taxa of Uma (Phrynosomatidae) inhabiting isolated dune systems across the North American Deserts have separately evolved convergent external morphologies, but differ in body mass, reproductive cycles, number and size of progeny, metabolic physiology and behavior. All are omnivores consuming variable proportions of vegetation including seeds along with insects that are part of detritus-based food webs. Populations of M. anchietae and Uma undergo dramatic density changes depending on annual surpluses or deficits of energy and water, mediated through unpredictable rainfall and prey availability. Unlike Namib lizards, which inhabit large contiguous dune landscapes, several species of Uma are seriously threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation from development and recreational activities. Harsh conditions common to all desert dune environments present similar challenges to species that live there, but differences in their age, climate and geographic extent offer exceptional opportunities for understanding evolution and ecosystem structure and function.

1182,1953,"A potential recovery of a population of the sand lizard Liolaemus lutzae Mertens, 1938 in an area within its range: a lizard endemic and threatened with extinction","The endemic and threatened lizard Liolaemus lutzae has a relatively small geographic range restricted to only 200 km of along the coast of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, which are habitats under intensive anthropic disturbance. At the Barra da Tijuca beach, in Rio de Janeiro city an estimate of the population abundance made in 1991, compared to a previous estimate made in 1984, showed a considerable decrease (about 65%). Most of the decrease was attributed to anthropic disturbances that locally affected the beach vegetation, the species habitat. In this study we present estimates made in 2002 and in 2006 at the same area and compare them with the estimates of 1984 and 1991, using the same methodology in order to make comparable the data from different samplings years and to evaluate the present status of the local population. The estimated indexes of L. lutzae abundance in 2002 and in 2006 were higher than that of 1991. There was a significant increase in the mean number of recorded lizards in 2002 compared to 1991, but the mean number of lizards sighted in 2006 remained stable when compared with that of 2002. Our data based on the index of abundance recorded suggested that the number of L. lutzae at Barra da Tijuca beach recorded increased, which can be indicative of a potential recovery of the local population."
1183,4269,"Density dependence, climate and fires determine population fluctuations of the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca","Population fluctuations are driven by a combination of multiple factors, which can; be classified into endogenous and exogenous.

Several studies have reported the effects of endogenous and; exogenous factors using exponential population models in mammals, birds or; insects, but few works have explored the effects on reptiles, specifically in tortoises.; In this study, we developed logistic population growth models to decipher; the role of these factors on the population dynamics of the spur-thighed tortoise; Testudo graeca. The role of environmental drivers in the distribution, movement,; survival, reproduction or individual growth has been described for this species in; previous works, but no studies have examined the effects of both endogenous and; exogenous factors in population growth rates. Using long-term data of T. graeca in; southeastern Iberian Peninsula (19992013), we fitted non-linear logistic models; with endogenous and exogenous effects. The results showed that endogenous processes; are important drivers of the population dynamics of this species, and that; exogenous factors, such as freezing hours in winter, also directly affect the population; growth rate.

1184,4539,"Demography of a semelparous, high-elevation population of Sceloporus bicanthalis (Lacertilia: Phrynosomatidae) from the Nevado de Toluca Volcano, Mexico","We studied demography of a population of viviparous lizard, Sceloporus bicanthalis, from Nevado de Toluca Volcano, Mexico, using mark-recapture methods. Age structure of this population varied seasonally due to an increase in number of juveniles over summer, although neonates were observed in every month. Estimated average density was 304 individuals/ha. Snout-vent length at sexual maturity in viviparous S. bicanthalis was 31 mm in males and 32 mm in females. Males survived longer than females, with an expected lifespan of 15 months, compared to 8 months for females. Net reproductive rate of this population was 1, suggesting it was at equilibrium, while generation time was 7 months. This high-elevation population has a semelparous life cycle."
1185,757,"Aggregative response of Harlequin Ducks to herring spawning in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia","We determined the scale of aggregative response of Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) to seasonally and locally superabundant prey at Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) spawning sites in the northern Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, in 1995-2002. Aggregations of 3400-5500 birds gathered at a small number of sites along the same 8-km stretch of shoreline each year that spawn was available there. Aggregations occurred in only a small fraction of the habitat area where spawn was available. Duration of stay at spawning sites averaged 2-3 weeks and many birds returned to their wintering grounds afterwards. Birds moving to spawning sites represented 55-87% of the total wintering population. The proportion of local wintering populations that moved to spawning sites was negatively related to the distance they had to travel, and few birds travelled farther than 80 km. The decline in proportions moving with increasing distance suggests that more distant individuals may be constrained by a lack of information or that there are tradeoffs between the benefits of exploiting spawn and the costs of movement. This raises a conservation concern because the temporal and geographic range of herring spawning in British Columbia is contracting and some wintering waterbird populations may be losing access to this important late-winter food.

1186,4167,Trends in sightings and environmental influences on a coastal aggregation of manta rays and whale sharks,": Sightings of planktivorous elasmobranchs at their coastal aggregation sites are often linked to biological, environmental and temporal variables. Many large planktivorous elasmobranchs are also globally threatened species, so it is necessary to try and separate population trends from environmentally driven, short-term fluctuations. We investigated the influence of environmental variables on sightings of 3 species of planktivorous elasmobranchs off Praia do Tofo, Mozambique: the reef manta ray <i>Manta alfredi</i>, giant manta ray <i>M. birostris</i> and whale shark <i>Rhincodon typus</i>. We used 8- (2003 to 2011) and 6-yr (2005 to 2011) logbook data for manta rays and whale sharks, respectively, and constructed a generalised linear model with animal sightings as the response. Predictors included temporal (year, month, time of day), biological (plankton categories), oceanographic (water temperature, time from high tide, current direction and strength and wave height) and celestial (moon illumination) indices. These predictors best fitted reef manta ray sightings, a coastal species with high residency, but less so for the wider-ranging giant manta rays and whale sharks. We found a significant decline in the standardised sightings time series for the reef manta ray (88%) and whale shark (79%), but not for the giant manta ray."

1188,1660,Combined effects of fisheries and climate on a migratory long-lived marine predator,"1. The impact of climate on marine ecosystems is now well documented, but remains complex. Climate change may interact with human activities to effect population dynamics. In addition, in migratory species conditions are different between the breeding and wintering grounds, resulting in more complex dynamics. All these possible effects should be considered to predict the future of endangered species, but very few studies have investigated such combined interactions. 2. As a case study, we assessed the relative impact of fisheries and of oceanographic conditions in breeding and wintering sites on adult survival and breeding success of a population of the endangered black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys in the Kerguelen Islands, Southern Indian Ocean. This study was based on long-term monitoring of individually marked individuals (1979-2005) and identification by tracking studies and band recoveries of the oceanic feeding zones used during breeding and non-breeding seasons. 3. Breeding success was variable until 1997 and then declined gradually, from 0.88 to 0.48 chicks per egg laid. It was favoured by positive sea-surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) and trawl fishery during the breeding period, whereas it was negatively affected by positive SSTA around Tasmania, where the species winters. Adult survival was 0.918 ± 0.004 on average and increased with SSTA during incubation, but decreased significantly with high tuna longlining effort in the wintering zone. 4. Our analyses show that demographic parameters were influenced by both climate and fisheries in both breeding and wintering grounds, but with different effect size. Black-browed albatross breeding success was more favoured by trawlers' offal and discards than by any of the seasonally/spatially oceanographic conditions, whereas their survival was equally affected by tuna longline fishery through incidental by-catch and spring SSTA. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our work underlines that a comprehensive knowledge of the life history of a species in all the habitats used is important to disentangle the respective roles of environmental conditions and human factors on population dynamics. Identification of these effects is required when proposing effective conservation measures, because the conservation of threatened species may depend on their wintering country's exclusive economic zones.

1189,3488,Relative influence of fisheries and climate on the demography of four albatross species,"Worldwide ecosystems are modified by human activities and climate change. To be able to predict future changes, it is necessary to understand their respective role on population dynamics. Among the most threatened species are top predators because of their position in the food web. Albatross populations are potentially affected by both human activities, especially longline fisheries, and climatic fluctuations. Based on long-term data (1985-2006), we conducted through a comparative approach a demographic analysis (adult survival and breeding success) on four albatross species breeding on the Indian Ocean sub-Antarctic Islands to assess the relative impact of climate and fisheries during and outside the breeding season. The study revealed that adult survival of almost all species was not affected by climate, and therefore probably canalized against climatic variations, but was negatively affected by tuna longlining effort in three species. Breeding success was affected by climate, with contrasted effects between species, with Southern Oscillation Index having an impact on all species but one. Differences in demographic responses depended on the foraging zone and season. In order to predict population trajectories of seabirds such as albatrosses, our results show the importance of assessing the relative influence of fishing and climate impacts on demography. "
1190,3966,Nonvolant mammalian populations in primary and secondary Central American rainforests as revealed by transect surveys,"Secondary forests are now prominent features in Neotropical landscapes, yet little is known about their conservation value for nonvolant mammalian communities. We performed a 20-month study using transect walks to survey the nonvolant mammal fauna in primary and secondary forests at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica. We found that secondary forests can hold complex mammalian communities and no species exhibited habitat preferences between primary and secondary forests. With few exceptions, behavioral and group dynamic characteristics of mammal species were similar between forest types. Our research allows us to address methodological questions and assess the effectiveness of transect sampling. Monthly detection rates vary widely by species and likely reflect short-term changes in behavior rather than population fluctuations. Air temperature and rainfall are the factors most associated with monthly detection rates for various species. Small-scale areas of higher and lower use are evident for several species. Neither time of morning for surveys nor number of observers per trail affects detection rate. We report current abundances for the most commonly observed species and note generally lower densities in the Caribbean lowlands than elsewhere in the Neotropics. This research highlights that in less seasonal, evergreen forests climatic factors can still affect mammalian behavior. Overall, we find that secondary forests are of high conservation value and that transect walks are an effective methodology to sample many nonvolant mammal species, and we present recommendations on how to sample properly to conduct rigorous and long-term studies."
1191,3031,"The effects of natural disturbances, reef state, and herbivorous fish densities on ciguatera poisoning in Rarotonga, southern Cook Islands","Ciguatera poisoning is a critical public-health issue among Pacific island nations. Accurately predicting ciguatera outbreaks has become a priority, particularly in Rarotonga in the  outhern Cook Islands, which has reported the highest incidence of ciguatera poisoning globally. Since 2006, however, cases of ciguatera poisoning have declined, and in 2011 iguatera cases were the lowest in nearly 20 years. Here we examined the relationships between cases of ciguatera poisoning, from 1994 to 2011, and: (i) coral cover, used as a proxy of reef state, (ii) the densities of herbivorous fishes, and (iii) reef disturbances. We found that coral cover was not a good predictor of cases of ciguatera poisoning, but high densities of the herbivorous fish Ctenochaetus striatus and reef disturbances were both strong predictors of ciguatera poisoning. Yet these two predictors were correlated, because the densities of C. striatus increased only after major cyclones had disturbed the reefs. Since 2006, the number of cyclones has decreased considerably in Rarotonga, because of the climatic shift toward the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We suggest that fewer cyclones have led to decreases in both the densities of C. striatus and of the number of reported cases of ciguatera poisoning in Rarotonga."
1192,1266,Increased nest predation in a declining and threatened Temminck's Stint Calidris temminckii population,"We measured nesting success of the Temminck's Stint Calidris temminckii along the Finnish Bothnian Bay coast during 19 breeding seasons (1983-2001) and conducted a population census (1999-2002). We found 105 pairs, showing a marked decline from the previous survey (170 pairs 1987-95). Of the 424 'known-fate' nests, 47% hatched. Depredation caused 79.9% of the nest losses. Nesting failures increased from 1983-91 to 1992-2001 owing to a rise in nest predation. The proportion of failed nests that failed because of predation rose from 48.9 to 87.7%. When only depredated nests were considered as losses, Mayfield nest survival probability over the incubation period dropped from 69 to 31% (461 nests). This pattern emerged both in man-made and in natural habitats. Survival probability was independent of habitat type (natural vs. man-made). In an experiment involving videotaping of dummy nests, Common Gull Larus canus and Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres were found to be the most important egg predators. "
1193,3377,"Density, movements, and survival of raccoons in Ontario, Canada: implications for disease spread and management","During 19942007 a total of 156,416 raccoons was live-captured in Ontario, Canada, as part of markrecapture studies to estimate raccoon density during rabies-control operations. Mean density in southern Ontario ranged between 3.4 and 13.6 raccoons/km2 when density in northern Ontario was <1.5 raccoons/km2. Raccoon density also was significantly higher in mixed cropland and deciduous habitats than in large tracts of deciduous forest in southern Ontario. Raccoons generally travelled <5 km between years during 19941997 markrecapture movement studies in Niagara; however, movements as great as 45 km and among-year differences in movements were observed. Raccoons in rural habitats also moved more extensively than those in urban areas in 1994. Mean home range (minimum convex polygon) for raccoons in eastern Ontario during 20032007 was 3.9 km2 for very-high-frequencycollared raccoons and 3.4 km2 for global positioning systemcollared raccoons. Mean movement from the release site by collared raccoons over the study period was 1.5 km with the longest movement being 10.3 km. No single habitat was used more or less by collared raccoons than expected. Survival of radiocollared raccoons over the course of the study was 0.62 with survival of raccoons initially captured and released as juveniles and adults being an average of 964 and 786 days. Knowledge of the ecology of raccoons should be used during planning for disease management, and was critical to evaluating the success of rabies-control programs in Ontario, Canada. "
1194,2154,Population dynamics and distribution patterns of longfin smelt in the San Francisco estuary,"The San Francisco Estuary supports several endemic species of fish and the southernmost populations of other species. Many of these native species and populations are imperiled or have experienced recent population declines that indicate a general decline in the estuary's capacity to support pelagic fish species. We studied the distribution and abundance of one of the estuary's native species, longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys, using data from three long-term aquatic sampling programs. Each of the sampling programs we studied revealed a substantial reduction in the abundance of longfin smelt. These trends support the idea that the estuary's capacity to support pelagic fish species has been significantly reduced over the past three decades. Longfin smelt in the estuary displayed consistent patterns in relative abundance and distribution during their life cycle. We also found significant, but weak, spatial autocorrelation among sampling stations. These patterns in distribution reveal differential habitat use and migratory behavior. Managers can use these insights into longfin smelt distribution patterns to improve interpretation of sampling program results. "
1195,1711,"Changes in the Status of Lophura Pheasants in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand: A Response to Warming Climate?","Long-term bird population changes in response to natural or anthropogenic factors have been relatively well documented in the temperate zone, but rarely in the tropics, where there are few long-term data sets. Here, we analyze a 25-yr sequence of records of two species of Lophura pheasants, Siamese Fireback L. diardi and Silver Pheasant L. nycthemera in Khao Yai, Thailand's oldest national park. These data suggest that the number and proportion of detections of the lowlands-inhabiting L. diardi have increased significantly in relation to those of the higher elevation inhabitant L. nycthemera. Environmental factors mediated by changing climate are the most plausible explanation for the changing proportions of sightings of the two species. Further work is needed to explore in detail microhabitat selection of these birds and whether changes in microsite conditions on the forest floor or other factors are driving the observed distribution. Long-term monitoring of the avifauna along an elevational gradient is also recommended in tandem with increased monitoring of local climatic conditions. "
1196,2610,"Growth Rate and Recovery of a King Penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, Population after Exploitation","Counts of king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus. in a colony at Lusitania Bay, Macquarie I. (54°30'S.,158°55'E.) have demonstrated a 78-fold increase in the number of chicks produced annually between 1930 and 1980. The observed rate of growth of chick production in the colony (r = 0.097) was constant over that period. The minimum estimated size of the population increased from 3400 birds in 1930 to 218 000 birds in 1980, after the original population was decimated in the nineteenth century. The colony now supports the third largest population of king penguins in the world and contains at least 70 000 breeding pairs and possibly as many as 100 000 breeding pairs. The site of the colony has been fully reoccupied, probably since 1975 when a second, new colony began to form elsewhere on the island."
1197,4111,Primates Decline Rapidly in Unprotected Forests: Evidence from a Monitoring Program with Data Constraints,"Growing threats to primates in tropical forests make robust and long-term population abundance; assessments increasingly important for conservation. Concomitantly, monitoring becomes; particularly relevant in countries with primate habitat. Yet monitoring schemes in; these countries often suffer from logistic constraints and/or poor rigor in data collection, and; a lack of consideration of sources of bias in analysis. To address the need for feasible monitoring; schemes and flexible analytical tools for robust trend estimates, we analyzed data; collected by local technicians on abundance of three species of arboreal monkey in the; Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania (two Colobus species and one Cercopithecus), an area; of international importance for primate endemism and conservation. We counted primate; social groups along eight line transects in two forest blocks in the area, one protected and; one unprotected, over a span of 11 years. We applied a recently proposed open metapopulation; model to estimate abundance trends while controlling for confounding effects of observer,; site, and season. Primate populations were stable in the protected forest, while the; colobines, including the endemic Udzungwa red colobus, declined severely in the unprotected; forest. Targeted hunting pressure at this second site is the most plausible explanation; for the trend observed. The unexplained variability in detection probability among; transects was greater than the variability due to observers, indicating consistency in data; collection among observers. There were no significant differences in both primate abundance; and detectability between wet and dry seasons, supporting the choice of sampling; during the dry season only based on minimizing practical constraints. Results show that; simple monitoring routines implemented by trained local technicians can effectively detect; changes in primate populations in tropical countries. The hierarchical Bayesian model formulation; adopted provides a flexible tool to determine temporal trends with full account for; any imbalance in the data set and for imperfect detection."
1198,4249,Dramatic declines in neotropical salamander populations are an important part of the global amphibian crisis,"We document major declines of many species of salamanders at several sites in Central America and Mexico, with emphasis on the San Marcos region of Guatemala, one of the best studied and most diverse salamander communities in the Neotropics. Profound declines of several formerly abundant species, including 2 apparent extinctions, are revealed. Terrestrial microhabitat specialists at mid- to high elevations have declined more than microhabitat generalists. These terrestrial microhabitat specialists have largely disappeared from multiple sites in western Guatemala, including in well-protected areas, suggesting that the phenomenon cannot be explained solely by localized habitat destruction. Major declines in southern Mexican plethodontid salamanders occurred in the late 1970s to early 1980s, concurrent with or preceding many reported frog declines. The species in decline comprise several major evolutionary lineages of tropical salamanders, underscoring that significant portions of the phylogenetic diversity of Neotropical salamanders are at risk. Our results highlight the urgent need to document and understand Neotropical salamander declines as part of the larger effort to conserve global amphibian diversity."
1199,4191,Aerial survey as a tool to estimate whale shark abundance trends,"Aerial surveys have been used to estimate population abundance of both terrestrial and marine species; in the marine environment this has largely been used for air-breathing species that spend time regularly at the surface. Whale sharks spend a large proportion of their time close to the surface and so are amenable to aerial survey techniques. This study presents the results of six years of synoptic aerial belt-surveys done nearly daily during the peak whale shark season around the island of Mahe, Seychelles. A total of 580 survey flights were flown providing 699.7 hours of survey record. A seasonal peak of shark sightings per hour was recorded in September or October in most years with the maximum on a single survey of 28.4 h- 1 in October 2006. The aerial survey data were used to generate an estimate of relative population abundance indicating that highest mean annual relative population estimate was also in 2006, with an estimate of 38, while the lowest mean estimate was 11 in 2004. These estimates were then compared to weekly capture-mark-recapture estimates of abundance based on unique individual identification data. The results indicate that the use of aerial survey data alone may give an acceptable indication of instantaneous relative population abundance but further refinement is necessary to estimate absolute regional abundance.

1200,2775,Present status of gulls and terns nesting in the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve,"The status of the breeding gulls and terns in the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve, South Ukraine was studied from 1984 to 1993. The populations of all species have recently decreased with the sole exception of Yellow-legged Gull which has increased. The main limiting factors are anthropogenic and interspecific relations."
1201,1492,Demographic Changes over Thirty Years in a Red Howler Population in Venezuela,"During a 30-year span (1969-1999) the annual growth rate of a Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus) population fluctuated irregularly, but its size increased, remained stable for a short while, and finally declined sharply. The increase took place in three stages, and began as an increase in the size of established groups. The next two stages of population increase were due to the formation of new groups and their subsequent increases in size. These two stages likely occurred because of habitat regeneration, which increased the areas where newly formed groups could establish home ranges. The population decline of 74% was most likely due to disease. However, new groups died out more rapidly than established groups, indicating that food shortages, especially in recently regenerated areas, may also have contributed to the population crash. The food shortages could have been caused by unpredictable periods of drought, which may explain the irregular size fluctuations of the study population. Since many howler species show irregular size fluctuations and sharp declines, their demographic features may reflect adaptations to unpredictable events like droughts and disease epidemics. On this premise we explain the preponderance of unimale groups and female-biased birth sex ratios at low densities and the dispersal of both sexes as adaptations for increasing a population rapidly after a decline. Within the population, mortality of small juvenile females was higher in multimale than in unimale groups, though medium juvenile and older immature females were better represented in multimale than in unimale groups. These results may be explained in terms of group composition and the mating systems in red howlers."
1202,3613,,"The gulf corvina (Cynoscion othonopterus), is an endemic species of the Gulf of California, and its fishery is one of the most important in the Upper Gulf of California. Two dynamic biomass models (Schaefer & Pella-Tomlinson), were used to assess the state of the stock due to the lack of enough age data for a reliable full age-structured stock assessment. The models required an historical annual time-series of the abundance index (from 1993 to 2010), derived from the commercial catch and effort data. The Akaike information criterion indicates that the best model was the Schaefer model. The maximum sustainable yield (MSY), estimated with the Schaefer model was 3.100 ton, with a maximum surplus biomass (BMSY) that will allow the capture of 8.200 ton, and a fishing effort (fMSY) of 457 boats. The fishing mortality (F = 0.43) was 26% higher than the fishing mortality at the biological reference point (F0.1 = 0.34). The average biomass from 2006 to 2010 was 52% of the optimum level of the fishery (Est2006-2010 < 1). In 1999 an increase of the fishing effort accelerated the decrease of the biomass. These results indicate that the stock has not been healthy, in spite of the Biosphere Reserve decree, because the core zone has not been respected as a prohibited zone for fishing, and because of the increased fishing effort."
1203,4186,"A fishery-independent survey of juvenile shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) and blue (Prionace glauca) sharks in the Southern California Bight, 1994–2013","A fishery-independent abundance survey was initiated by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) in 1994 to track the relative abundance and size of juvenile shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) and blue (Prionace glauca) sharks in the Southern California Bight (SCB). The survey was designed based on data from an experimental commercial shark longline fishery that operated in the SCB during 19881991. Survey sets were conducted annually during the summer months within seven 10×10min spatial blocks in the SCB close to the California Channel Islands. Between 1994 and 2013, survey effort totaled 460 sets. The standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of shortfin mako showed a generally declining trend from 1994 through 2010 with increases during the final years to a level similar to those of the mid-1990s. For blue sharks, the standardized CPUE showed a generally declining trend throughout the time series with the lowest values in 2012 and 2013, and an anomalously high CPUE in 2000. Catch rates varied across the survey area with fewer, larger sharks caught in the more northern blocks of the survey. Sharks of age classes 02 represented the majority of those caught in the survey (approximately 81% of blue sharks and 58% of makos), yet there was variability in the sizes of blue and mako sharks caught by year. The sex ratio of age-0 sharks caught was not different from 1:1 for shortfin makos, but skewed toward females for blue sharks. Although the survey area is relatively small and results show interannual and spatial variability in CPUE that is not fully understood, these data represent the first and only fishery-independent survey that has targeted these shark species in the SCB. The results of the survey and associated data provide useful information regarding regional relative abundance, size- and sex-compositions, and spatial distributions of shortfin mako and blue sharks, all of which are essential for stock assessments and fisheries management."
1204,1485,Fish Abundance in the Wilderness and Swartvlei lake systems: changes relative to environmental factors,"Fish communities throughout the Wilderness and Swartvlei lake systems were sampled in the winters of 1991 and 1993 using gill and seine nets. Gill net catches indicated substantial increases in the abundance of large juveniles and adults of the majority of marine fish species in both systems. Seine net catches indicated increases in the abundance of juvenile Liza richardsonii, but a decline in the abundance of other fish species. The recruitment of most fish is unlikely to have been negatively affected by the recorded fluctuations in salinity or turbidity. The senescence of macrophytes, however, may have increased exposure of recruiting Monodactylus falciformis and Rhabdosargus holubi to piscivorous birds and fish. The artificial breaching of estuaries during optimum fish recruitment periods in 1991 and 1992 may have contributed to the recorded increases in the abundance of fish in 1993. A longer duration tidal phase in the Swartvlei system during 1992 and 1993, compared to the Wilderness lake system, did not result in greater abundance offish sampled. There appears to be no justification for the artificial maintenance of permanently tidal conditions in the Swartvlei and Touw River estuaries on the grounds of benefit for the maintenance of viable fish communities."
1205,3092,"Coping with the cold: An ecological context for the abundance and distribution of rock sandpipers during winter in Upper Cook Inlet, Alaska","Shorebirds are conspicuous and abundant at high northern latitudes during spring and summer, but as seasonal conditions deteriorate, few remain during winter. To the best of our knowledge, Cook Inlet, Alaska (60.6? N, 151.6? W), is the worlds coldest site that regularly supports wintering populations of shorebirds, and it is also the most northerly nonbreeding location for shorebirds in the Pacific Basin. During the winters of 1997  2012, we conducted aerial surveys of upper Cook Inlet to document the spatial and temporal distribution and number of Rock Sandpipers (Calidris ptilocnemis) using the inlet. The average survey total was 8191 ± 6143 SD birds, and the average of each winter seasons highest single-day count was 13 603 ± 4948 SD birds. We detected only Rock Sandpipers during our surveys, essentially all of which were individuals of the nominate subspecies (C. p. ptilocnemis). Survey totals in some winters closely matched the population estimate for this subspecies, demonstrating the regions importance as a nonbreeding resource to the subspecies. Birds were most often found at only a handful of sites in upper Cook Inlet, but shifted their distribution to more southerly locations in the inlet during periods of extreme cold. Two environmental factors allow Rock Sandpipers to inhabit Cook Inlet during winter: 1) an abundant bivalve (Macoma balthica) food source and 2) current and tidal dynamics that keep foraging substrates accessible during all but extreme periods of cold and ice accretion. C. p. ptilocnemis is a subspecies of high conservation concern for which annual winter surveys may serve as a relatively inexpensive population-monitoring tool that will also provide insight into adaptations that allow these birds to exploit high-latitude environments in winter."
1206,1705,"Severe declines of Eastern Imperial Eagle Aquila heliaca populations in the Baikal region, Russia: a modern and historical perspective","The Eastern Imperial Eagle (Aquila heliaca), a vulnerable and declining species, is widely but sparsely distributed throughout its range. Because much of that range extends through the Russian-speaking world, relatively little on the species has been published in English. The world's easternmost population of Eastern Imperial Eagles, at Lake Baikal, Russia, is particularly well studied and, because of recent rapid population declines, is of great conservation concern. Here, using a data set covering more than 20 years evaluated in the context of historical accounts published in Russian, we assess recent severe declines in this population and the subsequent changes in its conservation status. In intensively surveyed areas near Lake Baikal, numbers of territories occupied by eagles have declined by 80-100% in the past 20-40 years. Likewise, throughout the entire region, the average number of known occupied and breeding territories were both more than 40% lower in 1998-1999 than they were in 1982-1983. These data suggest severe long-term declines in the population of Baikal's Imperial Eagles. Because we observed only limited decreases in reproductive output, our interpretation of the patterns in these data is that mortality of non-breeding birds (wintering adults and all pre-adults) is the most likely cause for this decline. Addressing the causes of this decline is critical to protect this severely threatened population from extirpation. "
1207,2667,Irrawaddy dolphin demography in the Mekong River: an application of mark-resight models,"Riverine Irrawaddy dolphin populations are critically endangered and much uncertainty exists over the population status in the Mekong River of northeast Cambodia and southern Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). We conducted 11 surveys over three years to estimate abundance at each survey as well as survival and the probability of individuals becoming unavailable for detection between surveys. We utilized novel mark-resight estimators to account for the detection process in estimating these parameters. Annual survival was 0.977 (0.040 SE) and movement in (0.060) and out (0.018) of an observable state was low. We estimated abundance at 84.5 (95% CI=77.9-91.2) with little change over our surveys. We also estimated recruitment and population growth rate for the marked, and presumably older, individuals by estimating seniority using a reverse-time model. Seniority was estimated at 0.999 (0.028 SE), recruitment at 0.001 and population growth rate at 0.978. Although the population size appears to be stable, we believe this represents the slow disappearance of a long-lived animal with no recruitment. Along with the isolated nature of the population and reduced population size as compared to historical estimates, we believe this population is in serious threat of extirpation. We believe there may be as few as 7 or 8 animals in Lao PDR and that the species is at risk of extinction there in the short-term. Although recent management actions (e.g., outlawing of explosive fishing and some restriction on the use of gill-nets) have likely been beneficial we believe identifying population goals to work towards, identifying additional management actions to improve recruitment, and designing the survey methods to best estimate the success of these actions is needed. "
1208,1703,The conservation status of the spectacled petrel Procellaria conspicillata,"The spectacled petrel Procellaria conspicillata is listed as critically endangered due to its small population size and ongoing mortality on long-lines. Spectacled petrels were counted in 2004, repeating a census made in 1999 at their sole breeding locality, Inaccessible Island. The 2004 survey took place earlier in the breeding season than the previous count, allowing for more robust estimates of burrow occupancy. During early incubation, birds responded to call playback at 69% of burrow entrances, but birds in at least 8% of burrows remained silent. Birds in shallow burrows were less likely to respond to playback than were those in deep burrows. Two repeat trials at 100 marked nests showed that at least 61% of apparently 'unoccupied' burrows were occupied on subsequent checks, resulting in an overall occupancy estimate of 91%. Occupancy was equally high in peripheral colonies. The apparent spatial extent of colonies increased slightly from 1999, and the estimate of total burrow numbers increased by 50%, from 5900 burrows in 1999 to 8900 in 2004. Validation surveys indicated that burrow numbers were underestimated (84 ± 3%) to the same extent as that in 1999 (85 ± 4%), and repeat checks of one colony where all nests were marked showed that even careful counts underestimated actual numbers of burrows by up to 10%. This suggests there are some 11-12,000 burrows, and assuming 90% occupancy, the adult population is likely to be at least 20,000 birds. The population has increased over the last five years, continuing the apparent recovery from a very small population size in the early 20th century. Despite this increase, demographic models indicate that the population remains at risk from relatively small increases in mortality, if mortality is determined primarily by fishing effort. Mitigation of long-line mortality remains the key conservation goal for this species. "
1209,4427,Recent population estimates and trends in numbers of albatrosses and giant petrels breeding at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands,"The second mid-summer survey of surface-nesting seabirds at the Prince Edward Island group (Marion and Prince Edward islands) was conducted during December 2008, seven years after the initial mid-summer survey. Wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans may have decreased slightly at Prince Edward Island, mirroring a decrease of roughly 2% per year at Marion Island from 1998 to 2005, a decline that has since reversed. Numbers of grey-headed albatrosses Thalassarche chrysostoma on Marion Island have remained stable, whereas the population on Prince Edward Island decreased by 20% from 2001 to 2008 (3% per year). The estimate of Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses T. carteri at Prince Edward Island was similar in 2001 and 2008. Counts of both sooty albatrosses Phoebetria spp. were substantially higher at Prince Edward Island in 2008, possibly as a result of better coverage compared to 2001. Dark-mantled sooty albatrosses P. fusca on Marion Island have decreased by almost 2% per year since 1996, continuing a negative trend from the early 1980s, whereas light-mantled sooty albatrosses P. palpebrata have increased by almost 6% per year at Marion Island since 1996. Counts of both giant petrels increased at Prince Edward Island (northern Macronectes halli by 44%; southern M. giganteus by 28%), whereas their numbers have remained stable at Marion Island. Current best estimates for annual breeding populations (pairs) at the two islands are 3 650 wandering albatrosses, 9 500 grey-headed albatrosses, 7 000 Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses, 2 900 dark-mantled sooty albatrosses, 800 lightmantled sooty albatrosses, 750 northern giant petrels and 2 800 southern giant petrels, confirming the global importance of the Prince Edward Islands for these seven species. Apart from the dark-mantled sooty albatross, their populations are reasonably healthy despite fishing mortality. "
1210,4169,"Spatial and seasonal patterns in sighting rate and life-history composition of the white shark Carcharodon carcharias at Mossel Bay, South Africa","White sharks Carcharodon carcharias aggregate at specific times of the year at localities along the South African coast. At Mossel Bay, on the southern Cape coast, four sites were sampled (Seal Island, Hartenbos, Kleinbrak and Grootbrak) to investigate spatial and seasonal patterns in relative abundance and life-history composition. These are known aggregation sites within the bay, each having particular physical and/or biological characteristics. Sightings-per-unit-effort data were collected from February to December 2008–2010. Sighting rates demonstrated significant seasonal and interannual variation at the four sites. The highest mean sighting rate was recorded at Seal Island and the lowest at Hartenbos, which might be a consequence of differences in prey availability. The greatest interannual variability was recorded at Kleinbrak, followed by Seal Island, with little variability at Grootbrak and Hartenbos. White sharks appeared to concentrate at Grootbrak and Kleinbrak in summer and autumn, at Seal Island in winter, and at Hartenbos and Seal Island in spring. All life-history stages were present year-round but their occurrence was influenced significantly by season (p < 0.05), although not site. Few adults (325–424 cm total length) were seen, with the highest frequency being in spring, whereas that of young-of-the-year (≤174 cm) was in autumn. Juveniles (175–324 cm) constituted 78% of the animals sighted, indicating that Mossel Bay is an important aggregation site for this life-history stage."
1211,3098,Population trends of the Dotterel Charadrius morinellus in Finland during the past 150 years,"The population trends of the Finnish Dotterel were studied for the past 150 years. A comprehensive study of Finnish ornithological literature was undertaken, the main bird archives were worked through and additional data were gathered through personal correspondence. Thus an almost complete coverage of the published observations was obtained,  augmented by many previously unpublished records. The number of observations was fairly stable up to the mid-twentieth century, the slight apparent increase being mostly due to an increase in the numbers of bird-watchers. In reality the numbers probably decreased. The peak abundance was most likely in the 1880s. The main reason for the subsequent decline was obviously overhunting. In the 1950s the Dotterel was still fairly numerous; a decrease probably started sometimes during the 1950s-1960s, although little published information is available. At the main Finnish study area (Värriötunturi fells) the number of breeding pairs has dropped dramatically since the early 1970s. The main reason for the recent decline is probably the use of pesticides in the wintering area . During the Finnish ornithological history the number of Dotterel have decreased to 1-10% of the original, perhaps even more. As no exact data were available for the Dotterel it was not included in the ""Red Data Book"" of Finland. The data presented in this report suggests that it would belong at least to the  category ""in need of monitoring"". The Dotterel is listed in the EC Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (Directive 79/409/EEC)."
1212,4448,Assessing the environmental status of the short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) in North-western Spanish waters using abundance trends and safe removal limits,"Monitoring and assessment of the status of marine mammal populations is a requirement of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Due to the difficulty of collecting data in the marine environment and because many populations of these highly mobile species inhabit waters of several Member States, monitoring of marine mammals is particularly challenging. In the present work we have used a 10-year time-series of data collected from multidisciplinary research surveys to estimate common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) abundance and trends in continental shelf waters of the northwest Spanish sub-region. We argue that this approach provides a valuable addition to large-scale dedicated surveys, offering a shorter interval between surveys and hence offering the possibility to track abundance changes at a regional scale. Trends in the number of dolphins present in the study area over the last 10years show a mean increase of about 9.6% per year, which results in an evaluation of Good Environmental Status for the species in the area using the abundance indicator adopted in the framework of the MSFD. Data obtained from dedicated dual-platform surveys have been used to correct the detection bias in our data collected using single-platforms (attraction toward the observation platform and animals missed on the track-line), to obtain absolute abundance estimates for calculating bycatch limits. The average abundance over the study period was 12,831 dolphins [CI 95%; 9025, 18,242] calculated with the conventional distance sampling methodology, 4747 [3307, 6816] corrected for attraction and missed animals on the track-line, and 22,510 [15,776, 32,120] corrected only for missed animals on the track-line. The estimated safe bycatch limit for this area calculated from these abundance values were 218 [153, 310], 81 [56, 115] and 383 [268, 546] per year, respectively. Comparing these figures with estimates based on different sources, the percentage of dolphins that die in this study area is higher than the maximum limit allowable under the OSPAR criteria for population mortality adopted asan indicator for the MSFD."
1213,2471,Stochastic population dynamics of an introduced Swiss population of the ibex,"Using a long-term data set on the fluctuations of a reintroduced Swiss population of ibex we estimated the parameters in a stochastic population model with theta-logistic density regulation, and how the environmental stochasticity was related to different climate variables. Our aim was to examine quantitatively the relative effects of variation in parameters describing the expected dynamics and the environmental stochasticity as well as the uncertainties in them for the development of reliable population projections. The specific growth rate r1 was 0.14. Density regulation mainly happened close to the carrying capacity K, indicating that the commonly used assumption in population ecology of loglinear density regulation is not always valid. Annual variation in the point estimates of the environmental stochasticity was correlated with winter climate. Uncertainties in parameter estimates were high, especially in the estimates of density regulation and r1. In order to examine the dynamical consequences of the estimates as well as the uncertainties in them, we constructed Population Prediction Intervals (PPI). A PPI is the stochastic interval that includes the unknown population size with probability (1 - α). Analyses of factors affecting the width of the PPI showed that the form of the density regulation as well as uncertainties in model parameters should be estimated when making projections of future fluctuations of introduced populations."
1214,2722,Management strategies for the wolverine in Scandinavia,"The use of Population Viability Analysis has recently been criticized mainly because uncertainties in population predictions are often ignored. We analyzed the viability of Scandinavian wolverine Gulo gulo populations that allow for the inclusion of uncertainties in parameter estimates and stochastic effects on population dynamics. We used the insight gained from analyses of stochastic population models to quantitatively analyze different management options for the wolverine. These management options were based on data from an individual-based demographic study in the Sarek National Park, Sweden, and data from monitoring schemes in Norway and Sweden. Stochastic components in population dynamics of the wolverine were large. Strong density regulation occurred around the carrying capacity. According to the World Conservation Union (2001), the carrying capacity of populations must exceed 46 sexually mature (≥3-yr-old) females to be considered not vulnerable. Continuation of the current levels of offtake in Norway will lead to extinction of the wolverine over large parts of the country. Hence, current rates of mortality of female wolverine make the northern population endangered, whereas the southern population is classified as vulnerable. Management plans allowing harvest of individuals should be based on a proportional threshold harvest strategy. Only 40-60% of the surplus individuals exceeding a certain threshold for harvesting should be removed. Our analyses emphasized the importance of including estimates of precision in parameter estimates, including stochastic factors in recommendations based on Population Viability Analysis, and examining the robustness of the conclusions against variation in crucial parameters by sensitivity analyses."
1215,2501,"Climate and spatio-temporal variation in the population dynamics of a long distance migrant, the white stork","1. A central question in ecology is to separate the relative contribution of density dependence and stochastic influences to annual fluctuations in population size. Here we estimate the deterministic and stochastic components of the dynamics of different European populations of white stork Ciconia ciconia. We then examined whether annual changes in population size was related to the climate during the breeding period (the 'tap hypothesis'sensu Sæther, Sutherland & Engen (2004, Advances in Ecological Research, 35, 185-209) or during the nonbreeding period, especially in the winter areas in Africa (the 'tube hypothesis'). 2. A general characteristic of the population dynamics of this long-distance migrant is small environmental stochasticity and strong density regulation around the carrying capacity with short return times to equilibrium. 3. Annual changes in the size of the eastern European populations were correlated by rainfall in the wintering areas in Africa as well as local weather in the breeding areas just before arrival and in the later part of the breeding season and regional climate variation (North Atlantic Oscillation). This indicates that weather influences the population fluctuations of white storks through losses of sexually mature individuals as well as through an effect on the number of individuals that manages to establish themselves in the breeding population. Thus, both the tap and tube hypothesis explains climate influences on white stork population dynamics. 4. The spatial scale of environmental noise after accounting for the local dynamics was 67 km, suggesting that the strong density dependence reduces the synchronizing effects of climate variation on the population dynamics of white stork. 5. Several climate variables reduced the synchrony of the residual variation in population size after accounting for density dependence and demographic stochasticity, indicating that these climate variables had a synchronizing effect on the population fluctuations. In contrast, other climatic variables acted as desynchronizing agents. 6. Our results illustrate that evaluating the effects of common environmental variables on the spatio-temporal variation in population dynamics require estimates and modelling of their influence on the local dynamics. "
1216,2476,"Predicting fluctuations of reintroduced ibex populations: the importance of density dependence, environmental stochasticity and uncertain population estimates","Development of population projections requires estimates of observation error, parameters characterizing expected dynamics such as the specific population growth rate and the form of density regulation, the influence of stochastic factors on population dynamics, and quantification of the uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Here we construct a Population Prediction Interval (PPI) based on Bayesian state space modelling of future population growth of 28 reintroduced ibex populations in Switzerland that have been censused for up to 68 years. Our aim is to examine whether the interpopulation variation in the precision of the population projections is related to differences in the parameters characterizing the expected dynamics, in the effects of environmental stochasticity, in the magnitude of uncertainty in the population parameters, or in the observation error. The error in the population censuses was small. The median coefficient of variation in the estimates across populations was 5.1%. Significant density regulation was present in 53.6% of the populations, but was in general weak. The width of the PPI calculated for a period of 5 years showed large variation among populations, and was explained by differences in the impact of environmental stochasticity on population dynamics. In spite of the high accuracy in population estimates, the uncertainty in the parameter estimates was still large. This uncertainty affected the precision in the population predictions, but it decreased with increasing length of study period, mainly due to higher precision in the estimates of the environmental variance in the longer time-series. These analyses reveal that predictions of future population fluctuations of weakly density-regulated populations such as the ibex often become uncertain. Credible population predictions require that this uncertainty is properly quantified. "
1217,2028,Increases in the numbers of breeding pairs in two populations of Buller's Albatross (Thalassarche bulleri bulleri),"The abundance and distribution of the southern subspecies of Buller's Albatross (Thalassarche b. bulleri) breeding on the Solander and Snares Islands were investigated during February-March 2002. At the Solander Islands, a total of 4912 breeding pairs was estimated from aerial and ground counts. This total compares to an adjusted total of 4147 breeding pairs estimated during February 1996 using the same methods, and indicates average annual increases of 3.1% during the period 1996-2002, compared with relatively stable numbers estimated for the period 1985-96. At the Snares Islands, a total of 8165 breeding pairs was counted on North East Island and associated islets from ground and vantage-point counts, and 8713 breeding pairs were estimated for the Snares Islands as a whole. Analysis of annual counts of breeding pairs on the North Promontory of North East Island showed an estimated increase in the breeding population of 3.2% per year. In 2002, the estimated total breeding population of Buller's Albatross at the Snares and Solander Islands was 13 625 pairs."
1218,889,Compatibility of brown bear Ursus arctos and free-ranging sheep in Norway,"In 1992, the Norwegian Parliament adopted a plan for brown bear Ursus arctos management. The main goal of the plan was two-fold: (1) ensure viable bear populations within five core areas along the border of neighbouring countries; and (2) limit the damage caused by bear on sheep Ovis aries grazing on open rangeland, which has increased over the last few years. In this study we have examined the possibility of attaining both these political aims. Sheep losses in two study areas within bear core areas rose considerably during the period 1981-1993, when the Scandinavian bear population increased by 1.5% a year. We found a significant correlation between the estimated number of bears and the loss of grazing ewes in both areas. No such relationship was found in the control areas (considered to be without bears) adjacent to the study area. We found no relationship between number of ewes lost and number of ewes grazing. Shooting of bears that presumably killed sheep had no effect on the number of ewes lost during the following season, probably because the number of bears killed in Norway was less than the number of bears immigrating from Sweden. Killing more bears is not compatible with the political aims of the management plan. It is difficult to reach all the political goals under the current situation. The loss of sheep will probably continue to increase unless changes are made in sheep husbandry methods in the core areas. Alternatively, sheep must be moved out of the areas set aside for the re-establishment of bears."
1219,2463,What shapes intra-specific variation in home range size? A case study of female roe deer,"Spatial distribution in mammals, and thereby home range size, is influenced by many different factors including body size, sex, age, reproductive status, season, availability of forage, availability of water, fragmentation of landscape, trophic level and intra- and inter-specific competition. Using linear mixed models, we looked for factors shaping the variation in size of spring-summer and winter home ranges for 51 radio-collared adult female roe deer at Trois Fontaines forest, Champagne-Ardenne, France (1996-2005). Home range size of females was larger in winter than in spring-summer, decreased with age, and decreased with increasing quality. Females in low quality areas adjusted the size of their home range to include more patches of habitat so that all female deer obtained similar amounts of food resources (total biomass of 6.73±2.34 tons (mean±SE) for each home range). Such adjustments of home range size in response to patchiness of resources led to marked between-female variation in home range size. Our results demonstrate that roe deer females have different tactics of habitat use according to spatial variations in habitat quality so that females get similar food resources in highly productive environments such as the Trois Fontaines forest."
1220,832,"A Time-Series and Geographical Analysis of Population-Dynamics of the Red-Backed Vole in Hokkaido, Japan","A time series and geographical analysis of the long term (25-years and 16-years) census data of the red-backed vole, Clethrionomys rufocanus bedfordiae, populations in Hokkaido, Japan was carried out. Eighty seven populations from all over Hokkaido were grouped into the following 4 types according to their flucturation patterns: type A: low density-constant type; type B: medium density-gradual increase type; type C: medium density-wavy change type; type D: high density-large amplitude type. The border between type B and type C was not clear. Although the distribution of the fluctuation types did not show any geographical cline, the high density type (type D) occurred in limited areas where the winter was severe and spring came later and almost all the populations in the Oshima peninsula were the low density type (type A). The most common type of population in Hokkaido, type C, greatly fluctuated from year to year with the maximum density level/the minimum one being over 10. The periodicity of the peak years was not statistically significant, although peaks often occurred at 3 or 4 year intervals. The population grew from spring to autumn in almost all years so that the pattern of the seasonal change was qualitatively constant. The population density levels in spring were not significantly different between peak years and others, while those in autumn were greatly different between them, so that the population growth rates from spring to autumn were variable from year to year. This differential pattern was also found between high and low density areas. "
1221,800,Density dependence in fluctuating grey-sided vole populations,"1. The presence of direct and delayed (1 year) density dependence in fluctuating grey-sided vole populations (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in Hokkaido, Japan, were tested using 90 time series spanning 31 years (1962-92). 2. The autocorrelation test of Bulmer, the randomization test of Pollard, Lakhani and Rothery, and the bootstrap test of Dennis and Taper using two different models (Ricker and Gompertz) detected direct density dependence in most of the time series (90-0 100%) at the 5% level (one-tailed test). 3. Plotting population growth rates as functions of abundance suggested that the Gompertz model is more appropriate than the Ricker model for the studied populations. The tests for direct density dependence using the Gompertz model also rejected the null hypothesis of density-independent growth more frequently than the tests using the Ricker model. 4. We extended the randomization and the bootstrap methods to investigate delayed density dependence by using partial correlation and partial regression, respectively. The extended tests detected delayed density dependence in 8-15 time series (8.9%- 16.7%) at the 5% level (two-tailed test). 5. The high incidence of direct density dependence and the low, but significant, incidence of delayed density dependence in these vole populations are discussed. Delayed maturation at high densities by social interference and a rich generalist fauna are thought to represent plausible mechanisms generating direct density dependence. As a candidate mechanism for delayed density dependence, specialist predator and climate conditions (affecting the exposure to predators) are discussed."
1222,3721,Seasonal pulses of migratory prey and annual variation in small mammal abundance affect abundance and reproduction by arctic foxes,"We examined how large seasonal influxes of migratory prey influenced population dynamics of arctic foxes and how this varied with fluctuations in small mammal (lemming and vole) abundancethe main prey of arctic foxes throughout most of their range. Specifically, we compared how arctic fox abundance, breeding density and litter size varied inside and outside a large goose colony and in relation to annual variation in small mammal abundance. Information-theoretic model selection showed that (1) breeding density and fox abundance were 23 times higher inside the colony than they were outside the colony and (2) litter size, breeding density and annual variation in fox abundance in the colony tracked fluctuations in lemming abundance. The influence of lemming abundance on reproduction and abundance of arctic foxes outside the colony was inconclusive, largely because fox densities outside the colony were low, which made it difficult to detect such relationships. Lemming abundance was, thus, the main factor governing reproduction and abundance of arctic foxes in the colony, whereas seasonal influxes of geese and their eggs provided foxes with external subsidies that elevated breeding density and fox abundance above that which lemmings could support. This study highlights (1) the relative importance of migratory prey and other foods on the abundance and reproduction by local consumers and (2) how migratory animals function as vectors of nutrient transfer between distant ecosystems such as Arctic environments and wintering areas by geese thousands of kilometres to the south."
1223,3720,"Productivity of lesser snow geese on Banks Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, in 1995-1998","We estimated that 264 000452 000 Lesser Snow Geese Chen caerulescens caerulescens nested at Egg River on Banks Island, Northwest Territories, in 19951998. This was about twice as many geese as was reported nesting there in the 1980s, and we estimated that the nesting population grew by 4.2% per year from 1953 to 1998. The number of nesting geese varied considerably among years and was lower in years when nesting was delayed by late snowmelt (called late years hereafter). Late years were also characterized by large numbers of nonbreeding geese in the brood-rearing areas, suggesting that timing of snowmelt had a greater effect on the proportion of geese attempting to breed at Egg River each year than it had on the number of geese arriving at Banks Island. Clutch size and nesting success at Egg River ranged between 3.5 and 3.8 eggs and between 45% and 86%, respectively, in 19951998. Both clutch size and nesting success were lower in years when nesting was delayed by late snowmelt, which suggests that depletion of body reserves while waiting for snow to melt was a key factor affecting breeding performance at Egg River. Clutch size and nesting success at Egg River were comparable to those of Lesser Snow Geese at other colonies of similar latitude. Lesser Snow Geese at Egg River laid more eggs outside of nest bowls in late years. We estimated that about 14% of the nesting population died at Egg River from 1996 to 1998 (goose mortality was not monitored accurately in 1995). There appeared to be more geese dying in late years, which suggests that deaths were related to the nutritional status of geese. There were likely several causes of death, but avian cholera was confi rmed in about half of the dead geese examined in all years. Avian cholera was, thus, an important factor affecting Lesser Snow Geese nesting on Banks Island in all years. We estimated that 441 000644 000 adult Lesser Snow Geese were dispersed throughout Banks Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary No. 1 during the brood-rearing season in 19961998 (the area was not completely surveyed in 1995, so we were unable to estimate the total number of geese in that year). The highest densities of brood-rearing geese were found in the river valleys closest to Egg River, whereas failed and nonbreeding geese moved farther and were found in the highest density in the delta of Bernard River about 125 km north of Egg River. Even though densities were generally lower on the uplands between river valleys, the vast area of the uplands (80% of the study area) meant that most geese were associated with ponds, lakes, creeks, and small rivers on the uplands. Gosling survival ranged between 27% and 44% during the fi rst 23 weeks after hatch in 19961998 and was similar to, or perhaps somewhat lower than, gosling survival of Lesser Snow Geese at other colonies. Goose use had a strong negative impact on the availability of graminoid plants (i.e., grasses and sedges) in the brood-rearing areas of Banks Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary No. 1. However, we did not observe any evidence of permanent destruction of habitats, even though there were indications that areas with high use by geese were heavily grazed, particularly in the colony itself."
1224,2044,Prolonging the Arctic pulse: long-term exploitation of cached eggs by Arctic foxes when lemmings are scarce,"1. Many ecosystems are characterized by pulses of dramatically higher than normal levels of foods (pulsed resources) to which animals often respond by caching foods for future use. However, the extent to which animals use cached foods and how this varies in relation to fluctuations in other foods is poorly understood in most animals. 2. Arctic foxes Alopex lagopus (L.) cache thousands of eggs annually at large goose colonies where eggs are often superabundant during the nesting period by geese. We estimated the contribution of cached eggs to arctic fox diets in spring and autumn, when geese were not present in the study area, by comparing stable isotope ratios ([delta]13C and [delta]15N) of fox tissues with those of their foods using a multisource mixing model in Program IsoSource. 3. The contribution of cached eggs to arctic fox diets was inversely related to collared lemming Dicrostonyx groenlandicus (Traill) abundance; the contribution of cached eggs to overall fox diets increased from < 28% in years when collared lemmings were abundant to 30-74% in years when collared lemmings were scarce. 4. Further, arctic foxes used cached eggs well into the following spring (almost 1 year after eggs were acquired) - a pattern that differs from that of carnivores generally storing foods for only a few days before consumption. 5. This study showed that long-term use of eggs that were cached when geese were superabundant at the colony in summer varied with fluctuations in collared lemming abundance (a key component in arctic fox diets throughout most of their range) and suggests that cached eggs functioned as a buffer when collared lemmings were scarce."
1225,1240,Past and current distribution of the purple swamphen Porphyrio porphyrio L. in the Iberian Peninsula,"The past and current status of purple swamphen Porphyrio porphyrio in Europe is reviewed, with particular reference to the Iberian Peninsula and the possible causes of the decline and subsequent recovery of the species in Spain. The main cause of decline has been the loss of habitat, namely wetlands with suitable vegetation cover and water levels. This forced the purple swamphen to concentrate in a few areas, increasing the risks from hunting or other disturbances. Recently, the effective protection of the species and the areas used by it, environmental changes such as the introduction of new farms and the creation of artificial wetlands (reservoirs) may have facilitated its expansion up the Guadalquivir river. Investigations in the Paraje Natural del Alto Guadalquivir (Jaén province, Andalusia, South Spain) have shown a significant increase in the population of the species in this area from 1983 to 1990. "

The total population increased at an average rate of 3.3% per annum over the last 55 years. There may now only be limited room for expansion on Ortac where the rate of increase has declined substantially in recent years."
1227,3939,Surveying while fishing in the slope areas off Brazil: direct assessment of fish stock abundance from data recorded during commercial trawl fishing operations,"Estimating the total biomass of fish stocks available for fishing at any one time can highly improve the process of deciding upon sustainable fishing management measures. However, countries where fishing resources are not abundant or valuable can hardly justify a regular investment in costly direct stock assessment programs. One way of overcoming such difficulties is to use catch rate data recorded from monitored commercial fishing operations, usually made available through the implementation of less expensive Observers programs. However, this data is prone to overestimate biomass of targeted stocks, because fishermen tend to operate in high-density areas. This study addresses this issue by exploring the use of geostatistical models to estimate biomass of three slope fish stocks of the Brazilian EEZ: codling (Urophycis mystacea), hake (Merluccius hubbsi) and monkfish (Lophius gastrophysus). The analysis included 25,824 commercial trawls conducted off Brazil between 2000 and 2009. Global biomass tonnage estimations were: codling 16,402 ton in 2001 and 23,816 ton in 2002; hake 267,712 ton in 2001 and 233,107 ton in 2002; monkfish 51,947 ton in 2001 and 16,998 ton in 2002. Values exceeded those obtained by scientific surveys conducted in the same period and area, but an in-depth analysis of methods employed demonstrated that such overestimation was only significant in the case of hake, the main target of the trawl fleet during the study period. The study showed that geostatistical models are most effective in reducing bias introduced by fishermen behavior when some catches away from high density areas are available. Those tend to be rare in the case of major target-species. "
1228,4479,Distribution patterns and indicators of the smooth hammerhead shark (Sphyrna zygaena) in the Atlantic Ocean,"The smooth hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena, is a pelagic shark occasionally captured as bycatch by industrial pelagic longline fleets in the Atlantic Ocean. Data for this study were collected by fishery observers, between 2003 and 2016. Datasets analyzed included information on catches per unit effort (CPUE), size and sex of smooth hammerhead sharks bycaught by the Portuguese pelagic longline fishery in the Atlantic Ocean. A total effort of 2 523 288 hooks yielded 638 sharks, ranging in size from 123 to 275?cm fork length. Larger sharks tended to occur in open ocean habitats and smaller specimens in coastal areas. Results confirmed the wide latitudinal range of the species (45?°N35?°S), although CPUE was higher closer inshore within the Tropical North and Equatorial regions. An overall sex ratio of 1.4 males for each female was observed, with more males in both inshore and offshore waters. Significant differences in CPUE and size distribution were found between regions, years and quarters of the year. Mean CPUE increased and mean specimen size decreased in the Equatorial region from 2012 onwards. In order to remove fishery-dependent effects from CPUE data, a Tweedie Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to create a relative index of abundance (standardized CPUE). The index showed some oscillations in the initial years (20082010), followed by a decreasing trend until 2013 and then an increasing trend in more recent years, until 2016. The distributional patterns and indicators presented in this study provide a better understanding of the smooth hammerhead sharks spatio-temporal dynamics and population structure in the Atlantic Ocean and can be used to improve management and conservation measures for this species."
1229,3061,Decline of a common reptile: case study of the piperine snake Natrix maura in a Mediterranean wetland,"The Ebro Delta is a wetland area in which natural ecosystems have been partially replaced by rice fields. This mixed and productive landscape has allowed the establishment of a rich community of organisms. The viperine snake Natrix maura has traditionally been a common and abundant predator because the habitat is favorable and prey availability is high. In June 1995, we conducted a demographic study to evaluate relative densities of snakes in the rice fields. Thirteen years later, we repeated the same study in the same area and season. The field work consisted of 29 censuses of one hectare each, and snakes and their potential prey (green frogs and fish) were counted. In 1995, we found 27 snakes (0.93 animals/ha), these occupying 48% of the sites. Frogs and fish were observed in 23 of the 29 censuses (79%). In 2008, no snakes were found and frogs and fish appeared in only 11 of the samples (38%). In 2008, we also prospected 20 sites in rice fields located next to the natural lagoons. At these sites, we detected a greater number of snakes (25% of the stations). Several factors can explain the clear decline of the N. maura population in the Ebro Delta rice fields: 1) the transformation and degradation of the habitat; 2) the increase in population densities of natural predators such as herons; 3) the decrease in prey availability; 4) the massive use of pollutants in the rice fields; and 5) snake death on local roads and directly by human persecution. We propose that a combined effect of these factors has caused the alarming decline of this predator. The observation of water snakes in rice fields near natural lagoons indicates that protected natural areas act as natural refuges for fauna with reduced mobility, such as viperine snakes. The recovery of the N. maura population in the rice fields of the Ebro Delta depends on an integral change in agricultural management, including the reduced use of pollutants, the recovery of snake prey, and the maintenance of favorable habitats to prevent predation."
1230,4376,Living on the edge: demography of the slender-billed gull in the Western Mediterranean,"Small and peripheral populations are typically vulnerable to local extinction processes but important for the metapopulation dynamics of species. The Slender-billed gull (Chroicocephalus genei) is a long-lived species breeding in unstable ephemeral coastal habitats. Their Western Mediterranean populations are relatively small and represent the edge of their global geographical distribution. At a local scale, using long-term data (14 years) on annual breeding success and capture-resights of marked individuals, we estimated and compared the vital rates and evaluated the connectivity of two Spanish populations (Ebro Delta and Donana) varying in their local environmental conditions. At a metapopulation scale, we analyzed 22 years of data on breeding numbers to predict their future prospects by means of population demographic models. Local survival and breeding success of gulls from the Ebro Delta was lower than those from Donana, which is likely the result of higher permanent emigration and/or winter mortality in the former. Gulls from the Ebro Delta wintered mostly in Mediterranean areas whereas those from Donana did so in Atlantic coasts, where food availability is higher. Whereas adult local survival was constant, juvenile local survival showed temporal parallel variations between colonies, probably related to natal dispersal to other breeding colonies. Our results suggested that dispersal was higher at the Ebro Delta and gulls emigrating from their natal colonies settled preferentially in close patches. We found large fluctuations in breeding numbers among local populations probably related to the fact that the Slender-billed gull is a species adapted to unstable and unpredictable habitats with high abilities to disperse between suitable patches depending on environmental stochastic conditions during breeding."
1231,3412,"Demographic response of Black bears at Cold Lake, Alberta, to the removal of adult males","Previous reports described an increase in population density following the removal of 23 adult and 3 subadult male black bears (Ursus americanus) from a 218-km2 study area near Cold Lake, Alberta (the CLSA). This finding plays a central role in continuing debates over population regulation in bears, but has been criticized because density estimates were based on assumptions that were not met. Moreover, subsequent discussion has been predicated on conjecture that human exploitation had minimal influence on population dynamics. We used improved methods of mark-recapture and survival analysis with a combination of new and previously published data to resolve these issues. Jolly-Seber estimates suggest numbers of females using the CLSA were relatively stable from 1969 to 1971, then more than doubled when males were captured and euthanized during 1971-72. Numbers remained high until 1975, when they declined abruptly. Similarly, numbers of subadult males captured annually increased disproportionately in 1972 and remained high until 1976, when they also declined. Changes in numbers of subadult males captured indicated changes in local density because they were not caused by changes in capture or settling rates. These findings support previous descriptions of trends in bear density at Cold Lake. However, survival records of 56 bears radiomarked during 1974-77 revealed heavier exploitation than previously suspected. Annual mortality rates of radiomarked bears ranged from 14 to 51%, and humans caused at least 25 of 30 observed deaths. Consequently, an underlying assumption of previous interpretations-that the Cold Lake bear population was naturally regulated near carrying capacity-no longer seems reasonable. Our results suggest that adult males deterred bears in other sex-age groups from using the CLSA; however, we found no evidence that birth or death rates were affected. Thus, the observed increase in local density should not be construed as a density-dependent response. Abrupt changes in local density might not have occurred if males had been removed from a larger area encompassing the CLSA."
1232,1958,Population density and annual variation in birth mass of guanacos in southern Chile,"We investigated the influence of population density and meteorological conditions on annual birth mass of guanacos in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile, from 1987 to 1996. Between 1987 and 1990, density of guanacos on the study area nearly tripled from 16 to 43 animals/km2. Mean birth mass was significantly different across years, and there was a strong negative correlation between mean yearly birth mass and population density. There was no correlation between mean yearly birth mass and mean temperature or total precipitation in either winter or spring during this period. Since 1990, density of guanacos has decreased, which we suspect is the result of degraded range conditions, partly due to overgrazing. Population censuses from other sectors of the park and the adjacent sheep ranch revealed increasing numbers of guanacos, and the movement of tagged animals out of the study area into surroundings with lower guanaco density."
1233,4586,"Effects of catch-and-release angling on a largemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ) population in a north temperate lake, 2001–2005","Catch-and-release associated mortality of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides; LMB) has received considerable attention due to the popularity of this fishery and the increasing prevalence of voluntary release by anglers. Most studies testing for the influences of catch-and-release fishing on LMB mortality and growth have been of short duration and conducted in artificial settings, which may or may not be representative of potential population-level responses observed in natural settings over longer time periods. We subjected Little Rock Lake South (8 ha), Vilas County, Wisconsin (closed to recreational angling) to an experimental five-year LMB catch-and-release fishery to test for effects on vulnerability to recapture, population abundance, size-structure, and growth. We fished Little Rock Lake South about once per week during May–September 2001–2005 with conventional angling gear and artificial lures. We also simulated or exceeded conditions typical of live-release tournaments by holding LMB after capture and later processing them for length, weight, and diet information. Catch-and-release mortality did not appear to negatively influence this LMB population as evidenced by the high number of recaptured individuals, increases in recruitment, and significant increase in density over time. We found no evidence of LMB being more difficult to recapture after being caught. Population size-structure decreased over time. Average body condition did not change over time; however, size-specific growth rates increased. The observed increase in growth rates, despite a significant increase in density, was likely associated with high prey availability. This increase may not be representative of growth effects observed over longer time scales should LMB density continue to increase. Our results suggest that catch-and-release fishing had minimal negative effects on the sustainability of an LMB population if greater abundances are desired. However, density-dependent compensatory responses in size-structure and growth may be expected over time."
1234,1647,density dependent effects between three competitive bird species,"Density and breeding success of the great tit Parus major, blue tit Parus caeruleus and collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis were studied in nest box colony in oak forest over a period of 19 years. Intraspecific density dependent clutch size reduction was found with blue tit and great tit. In interspecific relation the high density of blue tits reduced the clutch size of great tits. In the hatching period neither intraspecific nor interspecific density dependence were showed between the tits when the third competitive species, collared flycatcher was present. The collared flycatcher significantly reduced the hatching success of both tit species and the number of fledglings of great tit. The effects of the great tits and combined density of the great and blue tits on the hatching failure and number of fledglings of collared flycatcher were found when the density of the tits was high. There were not significant relationships to the single density of blue tits. The temporal variability of the competition of the three bird species is discussed. "
1235,2063,Conservation of the swift parrot Lathamus discolor - management lessons for a threatened migratory species,"Conserving habitat for wide-ranging fauna species provides a challenge because impacts on these species tend to be dismissed based on the assumption that there is sufficient habitat in other areas of its range. This incremental loss of habitat is a serious conservation issue for a diversity of bird species. As knowledge of wide-ranging and migratory bird species increases, it often becomes evident that they select specific sites on a regular basis (i.e., the species exhibit site fidelity). Gaining a better understanding of site fidelity and selective habitat use for wide-ranging species is clearly important, but also extremely challenging. In this paper, challenges associated with conservation of the migratory and wide-ranging Swift Parrot Lathamus discolor are discussed as an example of how a recovery programme has aimed to address such conservation and management challenges. Despite the small population size (less than 2 500 birds), broad distribution (1 250 000 km2) and often cryptic nature, the implementation of the national recovery programme has been successful in the identification and protection of important habitats. This has been made possible by involving large numbers of volunteers who collect long-term sighting and habitat data over large areas, together with more detailed ecological research. This information is then used to inform the conservation assessment process and to improve habitat conservation throughout the range of the species."

In total, the number of breeding pairs of this species in Montenegro is roughly estimated at 2,200 to 2,500 pairs. It breeds in mixed colonies, together with Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo, Squacco Heron Ardeola ralloides, Grey Heron Ardea cinerea, Little Egret Egreta garzetta, Night Heron Nycticorax nycticorax, Spoonbill Platalea leucorodia and Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus. The colonies are seriously disturbed tourists and fishermen."
1238,3309,Estimating Grizzly and Black bear population abundance and trend in Banff National Park using noninvasive genetic sampling,"We evaluated the potential of two noninvasive genetic sampling methods, hair traps and bear rub surveys, to estimate population abundance and trend of grizzly (Ursus arctos) and black bear (U. americanus) populations in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. Using Huggins closed population mark-recapture models, we obtained the first precise abundance estimates for grizzly bears (N̂ = 73.5, 95% CI = 64-94 in 2006; N̂ = 50.4, 95% CI = 49-59 in 2009) and black bears (N̂ = 62.6, 95% CI = 51-89 in 2006; N̂ = 81.8, 95% CI = 72-102 in 2008) in the Bow Valley. Hair traps had high detection rates for female grizzlies, and male and female black bears, but extremely low detection rates for male grizzlies. Conversely, bear rubs had high detection rates for male and female grizzlies, but low rates for black bears. We estimated realized population growth rates, lambda, for grizzly bear males (λ = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.74-1.17) and females (λ = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.67-1.20) using Pradel open population models with three years of bear rub data. Lambda estimates are supported by abundance estimates from combined hair trap/bear rub closed population models and are consistent with a system that is likely driven by high levels of human-caused mortality. Our results suggest that bear rub surveys would provide an efficient and powerful means to inventory and monitor grizzly bear populations in the Central Canadian Rocky Mountains. "
1239,3936,Impacts of the live reef fish trade on populations of coral reef fish off northern Borneo,"The live reef fish trade (LRFT) is one of the greatest but least-quantified sources of fishing pressure for several species of large coral reef fish across the Indo-Pacific. For the first time we quantify the localized impact of the LRFT. We collected data from three LRFT traders in northern Borneo, which yielded information on daily fishing effort and the species and mass of all fishes sold every day by individual fishers or vessels over 2, 3 and 8 years. Total monthly catch and relative abundance (catch-per-unit-effort) declined significantly in several species, including the most valuable species the Napoleon wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus, estimated changes of -98 and -78% over 8 years in catch and relative abundance, respectively) and lower-value bluelined groupers (Plectropomus oligocanthus: -99 and -81%) and Epinephelus groupers (-89 and -32%). These severe declines were rapid, species-specific and occurred in the first 2-4 years of the dataset and are, we believe, directly attributable to the LRFT. This has crucial implications for future data collection and monitoring if population collapses in other parts of the LRFT and similar wildlife trades are to be successfully detected."
1240,4331,Long-term trend of the waterbird community breeding in a heavily man-modified coastal lagoon: the case of the important bird area “Lagoon of Venice”,"The aim of the paper is to examine the temporal and spatial changes observed over a 25-year period in the waterbird community nesting in the largest coastal lagoon around the Mediterranean; to examine driving factors for the observed changes; to address the most urgent conservation actions. Published sources and field surveys made between March and July were used to assess number of breeding pairs of the commonest waterbirds in 1990–1992, 2000–02 and 2012–14. The breeding waterbird community exhibited several changes in its structure, with an overall positive trend; the number of species increased from 14 to 25 and the mean yearly abundance increased from 6155 to 14,008 pairs. The diversity (H′) increased slightly, whereas similarity indices and nMDS ordination both highlighted clear differences between 1990 and 1992 and 2012–2014 communities. The increase in richness and abundance were mostly due to the immigration of birds from nearby wetlands, to the partial recovery of lagoon ecological conditions since the end of the 1980s and to the occurrence of suitable man-made habitats, such as fish farms, dredge islands and a constructed wetland. The fraction of the population nesting at artificial sites and fish farms increased from 50% in 1990–1992 till 80% in 2012–2014, highlighting the importance of artificial breeding sites in costal lagoons. At the opposite natural nesting habitats, such as saltmarshes and beaches are losing importance for breeding waterbirds, thus requiring urgent conservation measures."
1241,4142,Long-term data indicates that supplementary food enhances the number of breeding pairs in a Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres colony,"The number of vultures is declining in many parts of the world due to numerous threats, such as; poisoning and collisions with power-lines as well as the lack of adequate food sources. Vulture restaurants,; i.e. supplementary feeding stations, have become a widespread conservation tool aimed at; supporting vulture colonies. However, it is poorly understood how vulture restaurants influence; population dynamics and whether they affect breeding success of vulture populations. We used a; 12-year dataset from a breeding colony of the Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres and a nearby vulture; restaurant in South Africa to investigate the effect of supplementary food on population dynamics; and breeding success. We found a significantly positive effect of supplementary food during the; nest-building stage on the number of breeding pairs. However, breeding success, i.e. the proportion; of successful nests, did not depend on supplementary food during the incubation and rearing stage.; Especially during the critical rearing stage, the amount of food supplied might not have been sufficient; to meet food demands of the colony. Still, our results indicate that carefully managed vulture; restaurants might stabilise vulture colonies and can therefore aid vulture conservation."
1242,2378,Massive immigration balances high anthropogenic mortality in a stable eagle owl population: Lessons for conservation,"The modern anthropized landscape is a major source of hazards for large animals such as raptors. Collisions; with cables, vehicles and trains, as well as electrocution cause casualties, which may negatively; impact populations. Yet, demographic studies of that impact remain scarce, which is an impediment to; evidence-based conservation action. We studied the dynamics of an eagle owl (Bubo bubo) population; in the northwestern Alps (Switzerland). We estimated, firstly, its demographic parameters using a Bayesian; integrated population model; secondly, the frequency of different types of casualty through radiotracking.; Thirdly, we investigated the effects of reductions of human-related mortality on population; trends. The breeding population was small but remained fairly stable during 20 years, suggesting that; it was apparently in a good shape. However, survival probabilities of all age classes were very low; (60.61), productivity fairly good (0.93), and immigration very high (1.6 females per pair and year), indicating; that the population operated as a sink. Half of the mortality was caused by infrastructure, with; electrocution accounting for 24% of all fatalities. The elimination of electrocution would result in a strong; population increase (17% annually). Under that scenario, immigration rate could decline by 60% and the; population would still remain stable. Given that the supply of recruits from elsewhere is likely to continue,; we can expect a rapid local population recovery if dangerous electric pylons are mitigated systematically.; Our study demonstrates that detailed demographic analyses are necessary to diagnose problems; occurring in populations and to identify efficient conservation actions."
1243,2418,When to end releases in reintroduction programmes: demographic rates and population viability analysis of bearded vultures in the Alps,"1. Reintroductions are commonly used for re-establishing self-sustainable populations in formerly inhabited areas. Reintroductions are expensive, and thus, it is worth performing a thorough demographic analysis of current and likely future population trajectories to guide strategic decisions on release policy. 2. Bearded vultures Gypaetus barbatus were exterminated from the Alps in the late 19th century, mainly due to human persecution. To re-establish them, captive-bred young have been released annually since 1986. Since the first successful breeding in the wild in 1997, the population has increased to 9 pairs in 2006. It is not known, however, for how long releases should be continued to obtain a self-sustaining, viable population. 3. We estimated age-specific survival probabilities with a mark-resighting model and quantified fecundity rates of released individuals. Using the resulting demographic estimates, we built a stochastic population model to estimate population growth rates, and explored the value of continuing to release birds for varying periods into the future. 4. Annual survival probabilities were high (first year of life, 0.88; later years, 0.96); average annual fecundity was 0.6 fledglings per breeding pair. Using the estimated survival probabilities, projected population growth rates would increase with additional years of releases. Yet, the population would grow, even if releases had stopped after 2006. Only if mortality increased by ≥ 50% would the population start to decline. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our population dynamics model provides essential information to optimize decision-making within a major reintroduction programme. From a demographic viewpoint, releases of captive-raised bearded vultures can be ceased in the Alps. The resources freed could be redirected towards a close demographic surveillance of the free-ranging population, with periodic evaluation of its viability and the option to release birds if deemed necessary. Birds available from the captive stock could be used for reintroductions in other areas where the bearded vulture is extinct. "
1244,2385,Harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena abundance in the southwestern Baltic Sea,"Harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena is the only cetacean species resident in the Baltic Sea. At least 2 different subpopulations occur in this area, with a presumed demarcation line in the western Baltic Sea. Aerial surveys were conducted during different seasons in the years 2002 to 2006, to obtain estimates of porpoise abundance for the southwestern Baltic. Within the survey area, 3 strata were defined. In total, 46 surveys were completed for these strata. Abundance estimates and corresponding confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each stratum separately for each survey. Density between areas varied seasonally and spatially, with the western study area (Kiel Bight) generally showing the highest density. Whenever all 3 strata were covered within 25 consecutive days, abundance for the overall survey area was calculated. Ten surveys met these criteria. Overall abundance in the western Baltic varied between surveys, with the lowest value in March 2003 (457 ind.; 95% CI: 0 to 1632), and the highest estimate in May 2005 (4610 ind.; 95% CI: 2259 to 9098). The results of all other surveys were in the range from 1352 to 2905 ind., with largely overlapping confidence intervals. Applying the only available bycatch estimates (which include no measure of precision) currently available for the German Baltic region, the percent of porpoise bycatch in the western Baltic lies within a range of 1.78 to 17.94% of the local population. To increase the precision of bycatch rates, more detailed bycatch estimates for this region are needed. Nevertheless, the results indicate that bycatch is a major threat to harbour porpoises throughout the western Baltic Sea. "
1245,1887,The effect of 'mosaic management' on the demography of black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa on farmland,"1. Like many farmland birds, the largest European population of the black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa, in The Netherlands, has been declining for decades despite conservation measures including agri-environment schemes (AES). In a new experimental AES aiming to reverse this decline, collectives of farmers implemented spatially coordinated site-level habitat management ('mosaic management') including delayed and staggered mowing of fields, refuge strips and active nest protection.2. We evaluated the effectiveness of mosaic management by measuring godwit breeding success in six experimental sites and paired controls. Productivity was higher in mosaics than in controls due to fewer agricultural nest losses. Chick fledging success was poor in both treatments. Productivity compensated for adult mortality in only one AES site.3. Although creating chick habitat was a major management goal, the availability of tall grass during the fledging period did not differ between treatments, mainly because rainfall delayed mowing in all sites and study years. However, chick survival increased with the availability of tall grass among sites. Higher chick survival will thus enhance the positive effect of mosaic management in drier years, but sensitivity to weather represents a weakness of the AES design.4. Available estimates of productivity in Dutch godwits suggest a strong reduction over the past 20 years and implicate chick survival as the main driver of their decline. Earlier mowing of grassland is the main causal mechanism, but changes in vegetation structure and composition, and increased predation may also have contributed.5. Synthesis and applications. Demographic rates like breeding success are useful parameters for evaluating effects of management. Mosaic management increases the productivity of black-tailed godwits, but does not ensure long-term population viability for this flagship species of wet grassland bird communities. More stringent management prescriptions need to improve both the area and the quality (vegetation structure) of grassland mown late. Management efforts should be concentrated in areas with favourable pre-conditions in order to improve overall effectiveness."
1246,1295,Changes in breeding site fidelity: A combined study of conservation and behaviour in the common toad Bufo bufo,One potential measure to counteract road mortality of common toads Bufo bufo is the establishment of populations at artificially created ponds by translocating adults. This is thought to be difficult because of this species' strong site fidelity. We describe here a successful resettlement of a substitute breeding pond in Northern Germany (Lower Saxony). We first created a barrier system made of used metal vehicle crash barriers which successfully prevented toads from crossing a road to reach a breeding pond. The toads were collected annually in pitfall traps and transferred to the substitute breeding pond. A majority of the adult population of common toads became attached to the substitute breeding pond after only two to three years. The migration directed at the old breeding site dropped to approximately 15% after four years and subsequently to less than 1%. Our findings show that the provision of substitute breeding ponds can be a useful measure for the protection of amphibians. 
1247,3049,"Marine turtle populations on the west-central coast of Florida: results of tagging studies at the Cedar Keys, Florida, 1986-1995","Large-mesh tangle nets were used to collect marine turtles in Waccasassa Bay, near the Cedar Keys, Florida, from June 1986 to October 1995. Tagging records were analyzed to determine the species composition, population structure, and seasonal occurrence of Kemp's ridley, Lepidochelys kempii, loggerhead, Caretta caretta, and green, Chelonia mydas, turtles. Additional information on local movements, morphometrics, growth, population estimation, and diet was provided for Kemp's ridley turtles. Subadult green turtles dominated the catch on the seagrass shoals of Waccasassa Reefs. Subadult Kemp's ridley turtles and, to a lesser degree, subadult and adult loggerhead turtles were primarily captured near the oyster bars of Corrigan Reef. Marine turtles were caught in these nearshore waters from April to November. Recaptures indicate that some Kemp's ridley turtles remain in the vicinity of Corrigan Reef during their seasonal occurrence and return to this foraging area annually. Seasonal and annual size distributions of Kemp's ridley turtles were investigated and regression equations were developed for carapace morphometrics. Carapace growth averaged 4-5 cm/yr for Kemp's ridley turtles, but growth analyses were confounded by the extrapolation of annual estimates from short-term recaptures. Population estimates for the Kemp's ridley mark-recapture data indicated a mean annual population size of 159 turtles at Corrigan Reef with presumably high rates of immigration and emigration by larger subadult turtles. Examination of fecal samples indicated that crabs were the primary food items of Kemp's ridley turtles captured near oyster bars."
1248,1354,Demographic Processes Underlying Population Growth and Decline in Salamandra salamandra,"Human activity commonly has negative impacts on wildlife. Often, however, only a single element of the life cycle is affected, and it is unclear whether such effects translate into effects on population growth. This is particularly true for research into the causes of global amphibian declines, where experimental research focuses primarily on the aquatic larval stages but theory suggests these stages have only minor importance for population growth. We used data from long-term mark-recapture studies of two natural populations of the salamander Salamandra salamandra to confirm the predictions of population models. One population remained stable (i.e., stationary) throughout the 20 years of the study whereas the other declined to local extinction. We used mark-recapture models to break down population growth rate into its two main components, recruitment and adult survival. Survival of postmetamorphic salamanders was constant over time in the stable population, whereas the declining population was characterized by a decrease in survival and constant recruitment. Population growth was most sensitive to variation in adult survival. Current amphibian research focuses on preadult stages, and researchers assume recruitment is the most important determinant of population growth. This may not be the case. A better understanding of amphibian population dynamics is possible only through the integration of experiments, theory, and data from natural populations. Our results also suggest that amphibian conservation efforts should focus on all stages of the life cycle and their associated habitats. "
1249,4271,An 18-Year Mark–Recapture Study of Wood Turtles (Glyptemys insculpta) in Michigan,"Wood Turtles (Glyptemys insculpta) occupy forested streams at midlatitudes in eastern North America and are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but few populations have been rigorously studied. We studied a population of Wood Turtles in Michigan for 18 yr, individually marking 260 different turtles (146 females, 88 males, and 26 unsexed juveniles), including 118 turtles that we followed for one or more years using radiotelemetry. We analyzed our encounter data using a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model in Program MARK; and we estimated total population size using a Bayesian integrated population model that combined Horvitz-Thompson estimates of annual population size, mark-recapture estimates of annual survival, and derived estimates of annual recruitment. Annual adult survival was 0.970 ± 0.016 SD and annual recruitment to age 15 (mean age of first capture) was 0.058 ± 0.019 SD. Over the 18-yr study, estimated population size grew from 770 (95% CI 631-928) to 1,196 (95% CI 977-1,444) individuals."
1250,2422,Status of pelicans and cormorants on the northern Black Sea,"The status of breeding pelicans and cormorants is assessed in the area from the Danube delta (Romania) to the northern part of the Crimean peninsula. Four breeding species occur in inland and coastal wetlands: Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus, Great White Pelican Pelecanus onocrotalus, Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo and Pygmy Cormorant Phalacrocorax pygmeus. Data on clutch size and breeding success are given. Historically, all four species were restricted to the Danube delta. Currently, with the exception of Dalmatian Pelican, they all breed successfully on the eastern Black Sea coast in the Ukraine. There are many conservation problems that will jeopardize the breeding of these species in the future if nothing is done. "
1251,4402,Recent population trends of sooty and light-mantled albatrosses breeding on Marion Island,"Sub-Antarctic Marion Island is one of the few islands where both species of Phoebetria albatrosses breed sympatrically. The last published assessment of their population trends, which reported counts up to 2008, concluded that the numbers of breeding pairs of sooty albatross P. fusca (Endangered) were decreasing, whereas numbers of light-mantled albatross P. palpebrata (Near Threatened) were increasing. Extending the counts to 2014 reversed these trends, with numbers of sooty albatrosses increasing from 2006 to 2014, and numbers of light-mantled albatrosses decreasing from 2007 to 2014. Confidence in island-wide counts is low due to the cryptic nature of the albatrosses on their largely inaccessible cliff-side nest sites, as well as counts for sooty albatrosses taking place late in the incubation period when 10−20% of nests have already failed. Given the greater conservation concern for the sooty albatross, we recommend that dedicated annual counts be conducted during the early incubation period, and be repeated shortly after the chicks hatch (late December), mid-way through the nestling period (late February) and prior to fledging (late April), to give a better idea of breeding success. Count zones also should be revised to facilitate more accurate counts, ensuring more reliable estimates of sooty albatross population trends at Marion Island."
1252,2367,,"About 40 km west of Berlin near Nauen, Brandenburg, there is the (1998) second most important autumn staging site for Cranes in the inland of Germany. In autumn, up to 13,300 cranes were counted. The status and history of this roost is documented starting 1975, when the first Cranes were seen at the site. However, at nearby Linum Cranes have been known to stage at least since the turn of the century. The roost has no legal protection. It may be lost if the sewage ponds dry up after alterations of the water purification plant of Nauen."
1253,2479,"Distribution, abundance and population structure of bottlenose dolphins in Scottish waters","Background Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) require conservation action in response to the EU Habitats Directive, the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the UK Biodiversity Action Plan for Small Cetaceans. The Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation (SAC) has provided an important focus for conservation efforts but protection of Scottish bottlenose dolphins requires management of threatening activities in other areas where our knowledge of their distribution, abundance and population structure is poor. In October 2005, the Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage commissioned a collaborative project to review existing data on the occurrence of bottlenose dolphins in Scottish waters, and to conduct surveys to assess the current distribution, abundance and population structure of this species in Scottish coastal waters. AddidoDal survey work was also commissioned to better understand the winter distribution of dolphins using the Moray Firth SAC. The project was carried out as a collaboration between the University of St Andrews' Sea Mammal Research Unit, the Scottish Association for Marine Science, the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust and the University of Aberdeen's Lighthouse Field Station, Main findings Most of the bottlenose dolphins using Scottish coastal waters occur around the west and east coasts. There are relatively few records of bottlenose dolphins on the north coast of mainland Scotland or around Orkney and Shetland. Photo-identification studies indicate that around 200-300 individual dolphins occur regularly in Scottish coastal waters, with numbers on the east coast being approximately five times higher than those on the west coast. Re-sightings of identifiable individuals demonstrate that the animals recorded during our surveys in 2006 and 2007 have used these coastal waters since studies began in 1989 on the east coast and 1995 on the west coast. Estimates of the abundance of bottlenose dolphins on the east coast were higher than previous estimates for this population. This could be because survey design in the earlier studies resulted in an estimate that was negatively biased, or because of differences in the mark-recapture models used for the two estimates, or because the population has increased over the last two decades.evidence of historic and contemporary exchange between Scottish and Irish waters. A high proportion of dolphins using the Moray Firth SAC in summer were also detected within east coast waters during winter. Passive acoustic monitoring highlighted that core areas within the SAC continued to be used during much of the winter, although at a lower level than that observed during the summer months. The following conclusions were reached: Photo-identification can provide a robust method for estimating the abundance of bottlenose dolphins throughout Scottish coastal waters. However, in areas such as the west coast, where animals are sparsely and unpredictably distributed, research surveys are best targeted through close collaboration with public reporting schemes. Only low numbers of bottlenose dolphins occur in Scottish coastal waters. Consequently, broad-scale systematic surveys provide limited power for detecting core-habitats either in winter or summer. However, this study has demonstrated that a combination of Passive Acoustic Monitoring and targeted photo-identification surveys can provide robust data on seasonal and inter-annual patterns of occurrence in particular coastal areas of interest."
1254,1392,Demography of two Mexican spotted owl populations,"The Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) is a threatened subspecies of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Although threatened, little is known about its population status. We studied the demography of the Mexican Spotted Owl in one study area in Arizona and one in New Mexico from 1991 to 1997. We estimated annual survival rates (φ), fecundity rates (b), and abundance (N) to test the hypothesis that population trends were stationary. Although annual fecundity rates (b̄ = 0.494 for Arizona and 0.380 for New Mexico) and annual juvenile survival rates (φ̄ = O.179 for Arizona and 0.109 for New Mexico) differed in magnitude between the study areas, they exhibited similar temporal patterns. Annual survival for territorial owls varied randomly in Arizona but declined linearly in New Mexico. Mean annual survival for territorial owls was 0.814 in Arizona and 0.832 for owls ≥ 3 years old and 0.644 for owls 1-2 years old in New Mexico. Based on survival and fecundity estimates, the annual rates of change (λ) indicated that both populations were declining at ≥10% a year. These estimates were corroborated by observed declines in abundance. Some regional factor may have been affecting fecundity, whereas a combination of factors may have been affecting survival. Two possible reasons for the population declines are declines in habitat quality and regional trends in climate."
1255,944,"Population structure, growth, and age estimation of Spotted turtles, Clemmys guttata, near their northern limit: an 18-year follow-up","Mark-recapture and radio telemetry data were collected from 1999-2001 on a population of Spotted Turtles, Clemmys guttata, near their northern limit in Ontario, Canada, and compared with a similar study conducted from 1983-1986. In 1999-2001, 32 Spotted Turtles were caught, 27 of which were adults. Females outnumbered males 3.5:1. The carapace length (CL) of adult males (108.5 ± 5.7 mm) and adult females (106.4 ± 6.0 mm) did not differ significantly. A minimum of 22% of juveniles and 40% of adults marked in 1983-1984 were still alive in 1999-2001. Adult population size was estimated to be 45 (95% confidence interval: 34-78). The average size of individual adults marked in 1983 (105.6 ± 6.0 mm CL) and recaptured during 1999-2001 (106.3 ± 5.9 mm CL) did not differ significantly. There was also no signficant difference in the number of growth lines on adults caught in 1983 (12.9 ± 2.0) and 1999 (14.0 ± 2.3). Based on the number of growth lines in 1983, these turtles averaged a minimum of 28.9 years in 1999, but actual ages are likely greater. Summer range length averaged 233 m (range: 200-275 m), while total range length averaged 327 m (range: 275-375 m)."
1256,1339,"A comparison of derived population estimate, mark-resighting and distance sampling methods to determine the population size of a desert ungulate, the Arabian oryx","Post-release monitoring, including abundance estimation, is an important part of reintroductions, providing a basis for management intervention designed to achieve long-term persistence. The Arabian oryx Oryx leucoryx became extinct in the wild in 1972, surviving as captive populations. Since 1982 reintroductions of Arabian oryx have taken place in Oman and Saudi Arabia. Modelling of oryx population dynamics has highlighted the importance of precise estimation of population size (N). Between 1990 and 2000 three methods of estimating N have been applied in Mahazat as-Sayd protected area in Saudi Arabia: derived population estimates (DPE) based on known births and deaths, distance sampling, and mark-resighting (MR). This study assesses the feasibility and precision of these methods. Inability to assess precision, interdependence of consecutive estimates, and the assumption that all gains and losses are recorded, make DPE of limited value. At current densities, distance sampling along 455 km of driven transects yields too few detections to derive precise estimates of N. To achieve a coefficient of variation of 20% it would be necessary to drive up to c. 2,900 km of transect; this amount of survey effort could be achieved through pooling of data across repeat surveys of established transects. MR estimates, based on re-sighting of collared oryx, have the potential to yield the most precise estimates of N when the proportion of marked animals reaches 30% of the total population. The most reliable MR estimates available indicate the Mahazat as-Sayd Arabian oryx population had grown to >400 animals by 2000. "
1257,2398,"Distribution, population size and breeding parameters in the insular population of Bearded Vultures Gypaetus barbatus of Corsica over 28 years","Capsule Between 1981 and 2008 population size was stable, but there were negative trends in breeding parameters. Aims To determine the current status and long-term population trend of an isolated breeding population of Bearded Vultures Gypaetus barbatus (Corsica, Mediterranean). Methods The total Bearded Vulture population was monitored between 1981 and 2008. Results The current effective breeding population size of Bearded Vultures in Corsica is ten pairs/trios with a slight increase of one to two pairs since 1983. The population is currently estimated at 25 individuals. Breeding parameters (laying rate, breeding success and productivity) have decreased significantly over the full 28-year study period, although the decrease was not significant when the data set was restricted to 1988-2008. A mean of 60.3% (n = 204) of pairs have laid, but this proportion is highly variable between years. Productivity has been very low (0.16 young/pair/year, n = 233). Breeding parameters of the Corsican population of Bearded Vultures are very low compared with those of other western European populations in the Pyrenees. Conclusions This isolated insular population is of small size (eight to ten pairs/trios) but shows a stability of distribution and numbers, but low (and decreasing) breeding rates, making this insular population one the most threatened in Europe.

1258,1991,Temporal changes in reptile populations: effects of a severe drought on aquatic snakes,"During the summers of 1985-1987, the southeastern United States suffered a drought equaled in severity only five times since AD 372. We monitored the abundance and population structure of five species of aquatic snakes before, during, and after this record event in South Carolina. There was significant variation among species in response to drought conditions. Based on capture records before the drought, Nerodia fasciata and Seminatrix pygaea left the study site in relatively high numbers whereas Nerodia floridana left in relatively low numbers. We found significant variation in the timing of movements among species; N. fasciata left the site mainly in 1986 and 1988 whereas Seminatrix pygaea left the site mainly in 1987. We suggest that N. fasciata left the site in direct response to low water levels whereas S. pygaea left in response to the absence of suitable prey. Snakes exited the site using discrete, non-random corridors. Long-term changes in abundance and species composition were marked; the prey base was altered radically, overall abundance of snakes was lowered, and Nerodia floridana was not seen at the site for five years after the drought. Our results support earlier suggestions that long-term data on populations are needed to determine whether population declines result from natural or anthropogenic factors."
1259,3060,Distribution and abundance of two imperiled Graptemys species of the Pascagoula river system,"Species distribution and abundance is often difficult to delineate due to species factors (e.g., crypsis, low; abundance) or to researcher sampling techniques. Species of the genus Graptemys are primarily riverine turtles and; have historically been subject to declines because of anthropogenic changes to river systems. Therefore, to better inform; conservation efforts, we thoroughly studied the distribution and abundance of two imperiled Graptemys species within; the Pascagoula River System, Mississippi, USA: the Yellow-blotched Sawback (Graptemys flavimaculata) and the; Pascagoula Map Turtle (Graptemys gibbonsi). Turtle populations were studied in 17 counties in southeastern Mississippi; using four methods: mark-resight population surveys (three populations), bridge surveys (160 bridge crossings), basking; density surveys without marked individuals (23 localities), and trapping (three populations). Graptemys flavimaculata; was found to be present throughout its historical range, as well as in new drainage localities; abundance in historically; surveyed areas was generally higher than previous surveys had reported. Graptemys gibbonsi was also found in many; new localities and occurred in most of the drainages of the Pascagoula River system. However, abundance was much; lower for G. gibbonsi than for G. flavimaculata throughout the Pascagoula River system and individuals were not found; in several historical localities, suggesting localized extirpations. We recommend that G. gibbonsi should be listed as state; Endangered in Mississippi and Louisiana, U.S. federally listed as Threatened, and upgraded to Endangered (EN) under; IUCN listing guidelines. Future conservation measures should extend to protect additional riparian habitat throughout; the Pascagoula River system and future surveys of other Graptemys species are warranted due to the imperiled status of; this genus."
1260,3455,Preservation of wide-ranging top predators by site-protection: Black and red kites in Doñana National Park,"We used data from a long-term study on two medium-sized generalist predators, the black kite (Milvus migrans) and the red kite (Milvus milvus), to illustrate the complexity of managing wide-ranging top predators by site-protection. The study was conducted between 1989 and 2000 in the Reserva Biológica de Doñana, located at the core of Doñana National Park. Both species occurred at high density and showed high productivity. Black kites were slightly increasing, and red kites showed a non-significant trend. The main cause of breeding failure was nest predation, mainly by mammalian predators, most likely Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) or common genet (Genetta genetta). The main cause of mortality was illegal poisoning, which sharply increased in the late 1990s. Nest-site selection models showed that: (1) black kites selected areas near the seasonal marshes, rich in their main prey species and (2) red kites selected areas rich in marshland and far from the park border, possibly in response to illegal poisoning episodes. Productivity was positively related to the availability of marshland and of open terrestrial habitats for black and red kites, respectively, and negatively related for both species to the density of black kites within 200 m of the nest. Our results showed that: (1) intraguild predation and competition among predators make outcomes of interspecific interactions extremely complex, leading to unpredictable side-effects of priority actions targeting one species at a time and (2) though the park was fenced and patrolled by wardens, the wide ranging behaviour of the two species made park borders permeable to negative human pressures, such as poisoning, leading to extreme edge effects and absence of a true, safe core of the park. Park management needs to be better integrated with its regional socio-economic and cultural context. Education programmes against illegal poisoning should be urgently promoted. "
1261,3368,Developing a population target for an overabundant ungulate for ecosystem restoration,"Ecosystem restoration typically focuses on re-establishing native plant communities with the hope of restoring ecological processes over the long term. In contrast, endangered species management usually focuses on short-term actions that directly affect population numbers. Here, we present an intermediate approach. We develop an ecologically based population target for the overabundant herbivore, moose Alces alces, with the goal of restoring a predator-prey system and thus preventing the extinction of the endangered ungulate, woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus. Forest harvesting is a major factor contributing to increases in the number of moose, which in turn increases predator populations. Caribou populations decline as a result of increased predation representing a form of apparent competition between moose and caribou. This presents a unique conservation challenge as recovery of caribou through forest restoration would take decades, while the alternative of directly reducing predator numbers is a short-term solution. A third option is to reduce moose numbers to also maintain predators at low numbers, but the question is to what density should moose be reduced? We created a statistically based target for moose abundance under conditions without forest harvesting by developing a habitat-based population model for moose under current conditions. We then calculated the habitat quality in the same area but under simulated 'pristine' conditions. We also evaluated three measures of ecological carrying capacity to determine the reliability of using current moose abundance to back-calculate numbers for the pristine landscape. Our analysis suggests an 81·6% (71·0-89·9%, 95% CI) reduction in moose habitat quality under pristine conditions. All three measures indicated that moose numbers in the current landscape were near carrying capacity, suggesting that the current abundance could be used to approximate numbers for the pristine landscape and thus be used as an ecological target. 5. Synthesis and applications. There are few experimental tests designed to alleviate predator-mediated apparent competition by reducing overabundant prey. Our target will now be used in an adaptive management framework to evaluate the success of this recovery option for caribou, and inform whether this approach can be applied to other systems involving species endangerment from the apparent competition mechanism.

1262,2797,"Vulnerability of harbour seals, Phoca vitulina, to transient industrial activities in the Strait of Dover","The abundance of the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) was recorded on a tidal bar in the Dover Strait off Calais, over a six-year period between 1999 and 2004. Despite clear seasonal and interannual variability in the number of individuals hauled out on the bar, underwater activities devoted to the installation of industrial wastewater pipes conducted during seven weeks 1 km away from the bar led to a dramatic decline in the number of seals hauling out. A full 19 months after the end of the operations the harbour seal population had not recovered their initial abundance. The results of this study have critical consequences on the conservation of P. vitulina in areas impacted by anthropogenic activities."
1263,3099,Population and distribution of the Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus) wintering in the Poyang lakes over the past decade.,"Using simultaneous land surveys, we monitored the population size and spatial distribution of wintering; Siberian cranes at 64 lakes around Poyang Lake between 1998 and 2010. The results showed that 46 lakes were inhabited; by wintering cranes, and in 25 of those, the number of wintering cranes accounted for more than 1% of the Siberian; cranes global population. The lakes where over 40.0% of the global population, e.g. 1 280 individuals, included Dachahu; Lake in Jiujiang region, and Banghu Lake and Candouhu Lake in the Poyang Lake Nature Reserve. The average yearly; population of the wintering Siberian crane in the Poyang lakes was 3 108±849, with the maximum of 4 004 individuals in; winter 2002. On the whole, there was no drastic fluctuation, but population numbers have shown considerable fluctuation; since 2003. We also found the Poyang Lake Nature Reserve was the major wintering area of the Siberian crane, with over; 60% of Siberian cranes wintering in the reserve since 2002 (except in 2006). Most of the inhabited lakes are covered in; existing nature reserves, though some lakes outside the reserve were also considerably used by Siberian cranes."
1264,3896,Bottom-up processes in a declining yellow-footed rock-wallaby (Petrogale xanthopus celeris) population,"Populations of large herbivores are generally considered to be food limited, escaping the regulatory effects of predation through their large body size, migratory behaviour and/or the occurrence of alternate prey species. In the Australian arid and semi-arid zones, the availability of forage biomass is considered to be the primary driver of fluctuations in kangaroo abundance. However, little is known about the population dynamics of the smaller sympatric macropods. We examined the demographic traits of a large colony of yellow-footed rock-wallabies (Petrogale xanthopus celeris), following a 2-year period of above average rainfall. The population was located within a conservation reserve that was subject to a predator control program around its perimeter and on neighbouring properties. The low predator abundance provided an opportunity to gauge the strength of bottom-up population processes. During the two years of the study, the population declined in size by 53%, resulting from both the virtual absence of juvenile recruitment and the loss of adult wallabies. Although reproductive output was high, low pouch young and juvenile survival rates resulted in few individuals progressing into the adult population. With minimal recruitment, the rate of population decline (r=0.77) matched the observed adult survival rate (Φ=0.76). Despite average rainfall conditions during the study, survival rates across all age-classes were equivalent to those reported for other rock-wallaby populations during periods of scarcity. The reduced survival rates were attributed to low levels of forage resources, particularly around the wallabies' refuge sites, suggesting the bottom-up regulation of the colony at high densities. The data suggest that the colony was at temporarily high abundance, following a rainfall driven pulse of recruitment. Conservation management actions for this species should focus on increasing juvenile survival rates within declining populations, through the control of feral goats (Capra hircus), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes)."
1265,4523,Tropical fish community does not recover 45 years after predator introduction,"Predation is considered to be an important factor structuring natural communities.; However, it is often difficult to determine how it may influence long-term, broad-scale,; diversity patterns, particularly in diverse tropical systems. Biological introductions can provide; powerful insight to test the sustained consequences of predation in natural communities, if pre-introduction; data are available. Half a century ago, Zaret and Paine demonstrated strong and immediate community-level; effects following the introduction of a novel apex predator (peacock bass, Cichla monoculus) into Lake Gatun, Panama. To test for long-term; changes associated with this predator introduction, we followed up on their classic study by replicating; historical sampling methods and examining changes in the littoral fish community at two sites; in Lake Gatun 45 years post-introduction. To broaden our inference, we complemented this; temporal comparison with a spatial analysis, wherein we compared the fish communities from; two lakes with and one lake without peacock bass. Comparisons with historical data revealed; that the peacock bass remains the most abundant predator in Lake Gatun. Furthermore, the; collapse of the littoral prey community observed immediately following the invasion has been; sustained over the past 45 years. The mean abundance of native littoral fish is now 96% lower; than it was prior to the introduction. Diversity (rarefied species richness) declined by 64% post-introduction,; and some native species appear to have been locally extirpated. We observed a; similar pattern across invaded and uninvaded lakes: the mean abundance of native fishes was; 540 times lower in lakes with (Gatun, Alajuela) relative to the lake without peacock bass; (Bayano). In particular, small-bodied native fishes (Characidae, Peociliidae), which are common; prey of the peacock bass, were more than two orders of magnitude (307 times) less abundant; in Gatun and one order of magnitude (28 times) less abundant in Alajuela than in Bayano.; However, total native fish diversity did not differ significantly across lakes, suggesting that; while many native species have declined in abundance, few have been completely extirpated.; Introduced predators can have strong effects on community structure and functional diversity,; even in highly diverse tropical communities, and these effects can persist over multiple; decades."

We use data from over 30 years to; gain insights into such changes in the northernmost Neotropical rainforest in the; Sierra de Los Tuxtlas of southern Veracruz,Mexico. This region has been extensively; deforested over the past half-century. The Estaci ´on de Biolog´?a Tropical Los Tuxtlas,; of the Universidad Nacional Aut ´onoma deM´exico (UNAM), protects a 640 ha tract; of lowland forest. It became relatively isolated from other forested tracts between; 1975 and 1985, but it retains a corridor of forest to more extensive forests at higher; elevations on Volc´an San Mart´?n. Most deforestation in this area occurred during; the 1970s and early 1980s. Forest birds were sampled on the station and surrounding; areas using mist nets during eight non-breeding seasons from1973 to 2004 (though; in some seasons netting extended into the local breeding season for some species).; Our data suggested extirpations or declines in 12 species of birds subject to capture in; mist nets. Six of the eight species no longer present were captured in 199295, but not; in 20032004. Presence/absence data fromnetting and observational data suggested; that another four low-density species also disappeared since sampling began. This; indicates a substantial time lag between the loss of habitat and the apparent extirpation; of these species. Delayed species loss and the heterogeneous nature of the species; affected will be important factors in tropical forest management and conservation."
1267,2115,The Effect of Impoundments on the Structure and Function of Fish Fauna in a Highly Regulated Dry Tropics Estuary,"Ross River flows through the Townsville/Thuringowa urban area in north Queensland, Australia. which has a dry tropical climate characterized by high inter-annual rainfall variation. Unregulated rivers in the Ross catchment basin deliver freshwater flows to their estuaries during both strong and weak wet seasons. The construction of a series of dams and weirs on Ross River means the wet-dry cycle is accentuated, leading to constant marine salinities throughout the estuary becoming the norm, with a lack of freshwater flow for five or more years at a time. The fish fauna of Ross River estuary was sampled in the post wet and dry seasons during an extremely dry climatic period (1994) and extremely wet climatic period (2000) using a small mesh (6 mm) pocket seine net. The fish fauna seemed to reflect seasonal differences. Catches from 1994 (dry period) were comprised entirely of 88 marine and euryhaline species, while the 69 species captured in 2000 (wet period) included 13 freshwater species. However, the freshwater species in the upper estuary were individuals washed over the weir, rather than part of a functional faunal gradient. During 1994 faunal composition was related more to site identity than to the position of the site along an upstream gradient. In contrast, during 2000 there were clear upstream faunal gradients with compositions in upstream sites heavily influenced by freshwater species, and marine and euryhaline species dominating downstream sites. Patterns of species dominance also varied between years. In contrast, trophic composition showed consistent shifts in both years, from high proportions of herbivores, carnivores and benthoplanktivores in May towards high proportions of benthivores in August. Not only do faunal composition, seasonal faunal change and ecological connectivity seem to be impaired, but ecological processes in the estuary that rely on seasonal freshwater flows are likely to be unable to operate normally in most years. The extreme seasonality in Ross River may serve as a model for many of the changes that will be experienced in dry tropics estuaries under global climate change scenarios of more extreme seasonality.

1268,1197,Long-term and seasonal dynamics of shrews in central Siberia. ,"The dynamics of shrew populations were studied over 13 yr in an area with 9 coexisting species: Sorex araneus, S. caecutiens, S. minutus, S. minutissimus, S. isodon, S. tundrensis, S. roboratus, S. daphaenodon and Neomys fodiens. There is a highly regular 4-yr cycle involving both rodents and shrews. The minimum year of the cycle is the same for all species of shrew, but different species reach their peak density at different stages of the general 4-yr cycle. The species also differ in the seasonal changes of their numbers. There is a significant relationship between the seasonal and multi-annual cyclic abundance changes, with species of high fecundity having the earliest peaks both during each season and during the 4-yr cycle. The species with later peaks are suggested as being competitively superior to the earlier species, suppressing the abuundance of the inferior species when they become abundant. -Author"
1269,3006,"Environmental and fishing effects on the abundance, size and sex ratio of the blue-throated wrasse, Notolabrus tetricus, on South Australian coastal reefs","The blue-throated wrasse, Notolabrus tetricus (Richardson), is a site-attached protogynous hermaphroditic; species, with a small home range of 10002000 m2, and the most abundant fish on inshore coastal reefs of; South Australia. Long-term studies over 1824 years were conducted at an island reserve site and a fished; mainland reference site. At the reserve site the retention rate of fish (reduced by mortality + emigration) was; directly correlated with female mean size; the female:male sex ratio ranged from 10 to 20:1, consistent with an; induction-inhibition model of sex-change. At the fished reference site, female mean size declined under intense; fishing, and the sex ratio became strongly skewed towards females. Additional spatial surveys over >2000 km of; coast showed that: (1) juvenile and adult abundance was variously determined by habitat features, such as; substratum-type, depth, bottom relief, wave exposure and algal canopy cover, and by geographical factors, such as; distance off-shore and within gulfs; and (2) that female mean size and the sex ratio were strongly influenced by; recreational fishing, and to a small extent by bottom relief and other factors. The results suggest that female mean; size and the sex ratio together can be used as an indicator of recreational fishing intensity at local scales. As; populations of sequential hermaphroditic species are sensitive to size-selective harvesting, management measures; should aim to prevent sperm limitation, reproductive failure and skewed sex ratios in this species."
1270,3206,Current status and distribution of greater white-fronted goose in Japan,"The numbers of the Greater White-fronted Geese Anser albifrons frontalis were monitored during winters from 2003/2004 to 2006/2007 throughout Japan. The annual average number of geese in Japan increased from 91,000 to 115,000 during these years and the maximum number reached was 138,000 in 2006/2007. Most geese (84%) stayed in northern Miyagi, and residual flocks were observed in other areas during winter. In the largest wintering area for this species in northern Miyagi, the number of geese has increased from 15,000 in 1987/1988 to 111,000 in 2006/2007. "
1271,2658,"Distribution and seasonal density of the finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides in the coastal waters of western Kyushu, Japan","The distribution and seasonal density of the finless porpoise were examined in the coastal waters of western Kyushu, Japan in 1987--1992 by ship sighting surveys and interview surveys with fishermen and ferry crews. Interview surveys showed that the porpoise may occur rarely in Sumo Nada and the waters of northern Nagasaki Prefecture and that it was found frequently in Ariake Sound, Tachibana Bay, and Omura Bay. In ship surveys by the line transect method, mean densities in the middle and mouth of Ariake Sound were estimated as 1.31--1.60 and 0.341 individuals/km,2 respectively. The porpoise density in the middle of Ariake Sound increased from September to April and showed a minimum in August. In the mouths of Ariake Sound and Tachibana Bay, the sightings became higher in summer. The porpoise distribution was considered to shift seasonally between the two seas. Water depth and distance from the coast seem to influence porpoise occurrence. Porpoises may favor depths of less than 50 m and distances of less than 2--3 nautical miles. The season of high density in Ariake Sound coincided with the reported calving season but not with the increase in the mean school size. The mean school size was 1.70 (SE 0.05). "

1273,2428,Galápagos Rail Laterallus spilonotus population change associated with habitat invasion by the Red-barked Quinine Tree Cinchona pubescens,"Species on oceanic islands are more likely to be endemic as well as more extinction-prone than those on continents. The Galápagos Rail Laterallus spilonotus, endemic to the Galápagos Archipelago, is presently known to occur on just four of its seven previously occupied islands and is facing multiple threats to its persistence. In this study, we compared the rail's occurrence and abundance at 193 survey points between 2000 and 2007 on Santa Cruz Island and examined the influence of an invasion of the habitat of the species by the exotic Red-barked Quinine Tree Cinchona pubescens. We detected a 13% reduction in rail occurrence and a 31% reduction in abundance between 2000 and 2007. Rail abundance declined more in low elevation areas (< 719 m) and outside of Cinchona pubescens removal areas but not in areas where Cinchona pubescens was removed. Insofar as Galápagos Rails responded positively to management actions that promote and maintain native vegetation, we conclude that restoration projects that restore native vegetation communities benefit this apparently declining endemic bird for which more focused conservation attention is warranted.

1274,3133,Patterns and dynamics of shorebird use of California's Central Valley,"Surveys of California's Central Valley between 1992-1995 document it as one; of the most important regions in western North America to migratory and wintering shorebirds.; Populations averaged 134,000 individuals in August, 211,000 in November, 303,000; in January, and 335,000 in April. Of 33 species, the 10 or 11 that averaged over 1,000; individuals each season accounted for 99% of total numbers. Managed wetlands, agricultural; fields (especially rice), and agricultural evaporation ponds held the most shorebirds. Species; varied their seasonal, geographic, and habitat use of the Central Valley, primarily in response; to changes in water availability from rainfall or management practices and latitudinal variation; in habitat availability mediated, in part, by climate. In the record rainfall year of 1994-; 1995, shorebird numbers increased 74% between November and January, primarily from; coast-to-interior movements of the Dunlin (Calidris alpina) and Long-billed Dowitcher; (Limnodromus scolopaceus) and local habitats hifts of Killdeer (Charadriusv ociferus). Although; the Valley's shorebirds face threats from poor or toxic water quality, changing agricultural practices, and habitat loss to urbanization, they should benefit from current efforts; to increase flooding of rice fields and to secure a stable high quality water supply for; wetlands. Development of a sound conservation strategy is crucial for the preservation of; shorebird populations in the Central Valley, as this agriculturally-dominated landscape is; among the most altered in North America and remains vulnerable to strong economic and; population growth pressures that may impact shorebird habitats in the future."
1275,3406,Burrowing owl population-trend surveys in southern Alberta: 1991-2000,"In Alberta, standardized diurnal call-playback surveys for Western Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) were conducted between 1991-2000 near the town of Hanna, and between 1993-2000 near the town of Brooks. In most years, the Brooks and Hanna surveys encompassed 10 360 ha and 7060 ha, respectively. Both survey areas are located within the historical breeding distribution of Burrowing Owls in predominantly native mixed-grass prairie habitat. The Hanna surveys indicated that the density of nests (x̄ = 13.7 nests per 100 km2, range = 2.8-32.6) declined significantly between 1991 and 2000. The decline in the Hanna area was most pronounced between 1991 (32.6 nests/100 km2) and 1997 (2.8 nests/100 km2) and recent surveys have found few nests. The Brooks surveys indicate that the density of nests (x̄ = 8.9 nests/100 km2, range = 1.9-13.5), although lower than Hanna, did not decrease during the course of the surveys. The significant decline in Hanna is most likely indicative of the contraction of the northern edge of the breeding distribution of Burrowing Owls in Alberta and suggests that the population will soon become extirpated from that area.

1276,2936,Variations in the diet and population density of the red fox Vulpes vulpes in the mixed woodlands of northern Belarus,"The dietary structure and distribution patterns of red foxes Vulpes vulpes in situations of different food supply in the coniferous-deciduous (mostly small-leaved) woodlands of northern Belarus were investigated. A total of 1526 scats of red foxes was analysed, and snowtracking of the species was performed each winter. Abundance of the main prey (small rodents, perching birds and hares) and wild ungulates supplying carrion for red foxes in the cold season were monitored. The results suggest that in northern Belarus red foxes had a diversified diet, consisting basically of different combinations of bank voles, Microtus voles, and wild ungulate carrion. The importance of carrion much increased in winter, while the proportions of birds and fruits grew during the warm season. In the ecologically rich woodland harbouring on clay soil, red foxes relied more on small rodents, while carrion and fruits appeared to be more important food item of the predator in the barren forested terrain dwelling on poor sandy deposits. During Microtus population outbreaks, red foxes more frequently fed on this prey. One-sixth lower density of red foxes was attributable to the forested terrain on sandy deposits compared to the woodland on clay soil, and a pronounced landscape-related difference in the habitat selection by the predator was found.

1277,2462,"Wolf Canis lupus numbers, diet and damage to livestock in relation to hunting and ungulate abundance in northeastern Belarus during 1990-2000","Wolf Canis lupus relationships with wild ungulates, domestic animals and humans were studied in an area of ca 800 km2 at the head of the Lovat River in northeastern Belarus during 1990-2000. The region was dominated by natural habitats (78%) consisting mainly of forests and bogs, but also lakes and rivers. The abundance of wild ungulates, such as moose Alces alces, wild boar Sus scrofa, and roe deer Capreolus capreolus, as censused by snow tracking and assessed by game wardens, declined 5 to 6-fold between 1990 and 1996, most probably due to uncontrolled exploitation and poaching. During 1997-2000, the numbers of ungulates began to recover. Wolves responded to the shortage of wild ungulates by a strong shift in feeding habits. When wild ungulates were numerous, wolf diet as studied by scat analysis was composed of wild ungulates (80-88% of consumed biomass), with small additions of medium- and small-sized wild animals (7-13%), mainly beaver Castor fiber and hare Lepus sp., and domestic animals (4-6%), mainly cattle. In the years when the recorded numbers of wild ungulates were at their lowest, wolves preyed on domestic animals (38% of biomass consumed), wild ungulates (32%), and medium- and small-sized wild prey (29%). Wolf damage to domestic animals (28 head of cattle and 247 dogs killed) and wolf-human interaction (100 observations of wolves in and near villages, including one attack by a rabid wolf on 11 people) were recorded in 14 villages. The rate of wolf predation on domestic animals and their appearances in villages increased exponentially with the declining biomass of wild ungulates and ceased again when wild ungulates began to recover; a one-year time lag in wolf response to changes in ungulate abundance was observed. The numbers of wolves as estimated by snow tracking and assessed by game wardens played a weaker role in shaping wolf-livestock and wolf-human interaction. The wolf population was strongly affected by hunting during the study. Wolves responded numerically with a 1 to 2-year time lag to the varying intensity of harvest by humans. Our study showed the role of the human factor in shaping wolf numbers and wolf-livestock interaction in eastern Europe. The three major components of this relationship were: 1) the manifold decline in wild ungulate abundance, which was most probably caused by uncontrolled exploitation by humans in the years of political transformation and economic regress, made wolves shift to predation on domestic animals; inevitably, wolves were frequently seen in the rural areas; 2) people interpreted the growing rates of wolf damage and appearances near the settlements as an effect of greatly increasing numbers of wolves, and demanded that authorities and hunters fight the 'wolf plague'; 3) hunting impact on wolves increased and led to a marked reduction in wolf numbers and a decline in wolf-human conflicts. This scenario was most probably repeated in many areas of eastern Europe during 1990-2000, which was a decade of political and economical transformation. From a management perspective, we suggested that predation levels and wolf-human conflicts could be reduced not only by increased wolf harvest but also by enhancing the density and diversity of wild ungulates."
1278,2384,"A decade of harbour porpoise occurrence in German waters--Analyses of aerial surveys, incidental sightings and strandings","Data on the occurrence of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in German waters from 1988 to 2002 were collected from dedicated aerial surveys, incidental sightings and strandings. Aerial surveys conducted in 1995 and 1996 revealed a mean abundance of 4288 (in 1995) and 7356 harbour porpoises (in 1996) in the German North Sea study area. Mean abundances of harbour porpoises in the German Baltic Sea, divided into two subunits (blocks B and C), were estimated at 980 and 1830 (in 1995 and 1996 resp.) and at 601 (in 1995; there were no sightings in block C during the 1996 survey). From 1988 to 2002, 791 incidental sightings of harbour porpoise pods were reported in German and partly Danish coastal waters of the North and Baltic Seas. In the period 1990 to 2001, 996 harbour porpoises were found stranded along the German North Sea coast and 17 animals were identified as by-catch. In the same period 229 harbour porpoises were found stranded along the German Baltic Sea coast and 105 animals were incidentally taken in fisheries. The proportion of by-caught harbour porpoises was significantly larger in the Baltic Sea. Different monitoring methods are helpful for different aims and management issues: aerial surveys cover large areas in a short time and provide information on density, abundance, distributional patterns and seasonality. Incidental sighting and stranding networks provide indications of general distribution, seasonal variation in abundance, age distribution, by-catch and of areas which are important in the harbour porpoise's life cycle. Comparison of data from the North and Baltic Seas revealed a higher abundance of harbour porpoises in the North Sea than in the Baltic Sea. Altogether the data sets demonstrated a strong seasonality of harbour porpoise occurrence off the German coast with highest numbers during the summer months. Important habitats for harbour porpoises were detected west of the islands of Sylt and Amrum in the North Sea and around the Schlei estuary, in waters west of Fehmarn and the Fischland-Darss area in the Baltic Sea.

1279,2612,"The status of breeding birds at Harmony Point, Nelson Island, Antarctica in summer 1995/96","A survey of breeding birds was carried out in summer 1995/96 at Harmony Point, Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 14, Nelson Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. A total of 12 species was recorded: Gentoo Penguin Pygoscelis papua (3347 breeding pairs), Chinstrap Penguin P. antarctica (89 685), Southern Giant Petrel Macronectes giganteus (746), Pintado or Cape Petrel Daption capense (479), Wilson's Storm Petrel Oceanites oceanicus and Black-bellied Storm Petrel Fregetta tropica (103), Imperial Cormorant Phalacrocorax atriceps (45), Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus (128), Subantarctic Skua Catharacta antarctica (61), South Polar Skua C. maccormicki (10), Antarctic Tern Sterna vittata (173) and Greater Sheathbill Chionis alba (144). Population size and distribution of species breeding in the area are updated and possible factors related to changes occurring during a short time period discussed."
1280,3415,Tests of density dependence using indices of relative abundance in a deer population,"A major question in animal ecology is explaining the causes of population fluctuations. Consensus about the most reliable method to detect density dependence (DD) or environmental effects from time-series data, however, has not yet been achieved. Times series analyses have been used with indices of relative abundance in numerous studies, although these indices are rarely validated. Here, we used three different time series of relative abundance (number of deer seen per hunter per day, hunting success and proportion of males in the harvest) to explore direct and delayed DD in a white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus population on Anticosti Island, Québec, Canada. Three mathematical approaches were tested: linear models, autoregressive (AR) models, and total DD in life history. Tests of DD using different indices of abundance on the same population should lead to similar results if all indices exhibit similar behaviour. Indices of relative abundance correlated with each other, although sometimes weakly, such that we obtained similar DD estimates with each index using detrended non-stationary series. In most time series, linear regression of N t-1 and N t and AR models did not detect DD, while we obtained strong evidence for DD from the life-history approach. This meant that contrasting conclusions about the role of density dependence within this population were reached depending on which method was used. We conclude that the method that incorporates most biological realism, the life-history approach, provided a different result than classical interpretation of autoregressive coefficients. Only the life-history interpretation supported our a priori belief that density dependence operating through competition for food regulates the Anticosti deer population. Phenomenological analysis aiming to investigate changes in abundance should be carefully conducted as the use of inappropriate indices or methods could lead to inappropriate conclusions or management strategies. Preferably, the method used should match the time scale of the population sampling regime and species life history. "
1281,1548,Oceanographic and climatic factors influencing breeding and colony attendance patterns of Humboldt penguins Spheniscus humboldti in central Chile,"A colony of Humboldt penguins Spheniscus humboldti in central Chile was monitored from August 1995 to July 2000 to determine patterns of breeding and colony attendance and how these were affected by climatic (rainfall) and oceanographic (El Niño) factors. Nests were periodically checked for contents and roosting birds were counted from vantage points. Two main breeding events were observed: between August and January (spring event) and between April and June (autumn event). Whereas the spring event regularly produced offspring, the autumn event was systematically affected by rains, causing considerable nest desertion. Adults were present in the colony from August to May, abandoning the colony during winter after the nests were flooded. Juveniles occurred only between November and March. Adults moulted mainly in February, while juveniles moulted in January. During the 1997/98 El Niño episode, the number of breeding pairs was 55 to 85 % lower than the mean, the onset of nesting was delayed, and abnormally heavy rainfall flooded nests. While the number of breeding pairs was significantly related to sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA), breeding success was not. The attendance of adults and juveniles at the colony during El Niño was 25 and 73 % lower, respectively, than the mean attendance. This 2-peak breeding strategy of Humboldt penguins appears to have evolved in response to the more favourable oceanographic and climatic conditions of Perú, where breeding is continuous and not interrupted by rains. Although less productive, the species probably maintains its autumnal breeding in central Chile because this provides additional offspring to supplement those regularly produced during the spring event."
1282,1269,"Population declines, viable breeding areas, and management options for Flamingoes in Southern Africa","Habitat rehabilitation or intervention to prevent species declines are rarely employed in Africa. I argue that despite protection in national parks, active intervention is necessary to halt declines in southern Africa's Greater (Phoenicopterus ruber) and Lesser (Phoeniconaias minor) Flamingo populations. Flamingos are long-lived species that breed sporadically at only two localities in southern Africa: the Makgadikgadi Pans in Botswana and Etosha National Park in Namibia. Despite well-publicized breeding on Etosha Pan, flamingos have experienced only three major breeding events in 40 years. Breeding failure occurs when high evaporation rates rapidly dry the pan, and up to 100,000 flightless chicks may starve. Consequently, pairs breeding in Etosha exhibit extraordinarily low recruitment (0.040 young pair/year) and extrapolations indicate that adults can replace themselves only if they breed for 38 to 50 years and all offspring survive. Because survival of offspring from fledging to adulthood (5 years) is about 46%, this breeding lifespan rises to an unrealistic 83 years, making Etosha a nonviable breeding site. Alternative, suitable flamingo habitats in Africa are being mined for soda-ash, are damaged by pollution, or are unprotected. Accordingly, continent-wide estimates and those from southern Africa alone suggest a population decline of about 40% in both species over the last 15 years. Because Namibia regularly supports 84% of the Greater and 93% of the Lesser Flamingos in southern Africa, conservation strategies are best focused there. Simple but effective management methods, based on those employed in western Europe, could reverse these downward trends. In Etosha a small island surrounded by a water-filled depression would allow up to 4000 pairs to breed annually. The benefits of enhancing the breeding of flamingos in Etosha include research opportunities, tourism revenue, and a safe haven for two Red Data species."
1283,1355,Evaluating Great Smoky Mountains National Park as a Population Source for the Wood Thrush,"The prevailing fragmentation paradigm predicts that large, intact forests are acting as population sources for Neotropical migrant landbirds. We used the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) as a model for evaluating the role Great Smoky Mountains National Park (the largest national park in the eastern United States) may play in maintaining regional songbird populations. We estimated the annual productivity of Wood Thrushes in the park by combining observations on the birds' distribution, abundance, and productivity with estimates of habitat availability. We estimated a breeding population of approximately 10,000 nesting pairs using habitat models developed from over 2500 point-count censuses conducted across the park. Data from 426 nests monitored from 1992 to 1997 produced a daily nest survival rate of 0.96. We estimated an annual fecundity of 2.76 fledglings per breeding pair, based on a model that incorporated the re-nesting behavior of Wood Thrushes. Results indicate that the park is producing approximately 3000 surplus female young each year. Daily nest survival rates were below those reported in other studies of Wood Thrushes in large forest tracts. The relatively high productivity of 3.31 nestlings per successful nest suggests that, in the absence of predation, the park provides high-quality nesting habitat for Wood Thrushes, but that it may also support a more diverse and abundant predator community than more disturbed or less contiguous sites. The difficulties of estimating the size of continental breeding bird populations make assessing the significance of the park within a regional landscape context problematic, but our estimates suggest that, although the park is functioning as a substantial population source on a local scale, its potential to sustain regional or continental Wood Thrush populations is limited. Our findings suggest that species such as the Wood Thrush are capable of moderate levels of surplus productivity in high-quality habitat, but that extensive areas of suitable habitat outside protected areas and other public lands will be required to sustain continental breeding populations."
1284,4171,"Results of a fishery-independent survey for pelagic sharks in the western North Atlantic, 1977–1994","Catch and effort data from a fishery-independent longline survey in the western North Atlantic were used to investigate the biology, distribution and abundance of pelagic sharks. Data were restricted to the period from 1977 to 1994, and for the months of June-August. Catches were dominated by the blue shark (Prionace glauca), with smaller numbers of shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), porbeagle (Lamna nasus), thresher (Alopias spp.) and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks. Detailed analysis was restricted to P. glauca due to small sample sizes for the other species. Male blue sharks were caught more often than females. The catches included juveniles and adults of both sexes but very few adult females. Annual sex ratios varied, but normally favored males. Monthly sex ratios were even in June, but favored males in July and August. Due to differences in occurrence between males and females, distribution and abundance data were analyzed separately for each sex. Male catch per unit effort (CPUE) was highest between 15 and 20 °C, while female CPUE peaked at approximately 15 °C and decreased with increasing water temperatures. CPUE for males and females were standardized using a generalized linear model with years, months and day-night as factors. Males showed an approximately 80% decline between the mid-1980s and the early 1990s, while a significant change in female catch rates could not be demonstrated. The results of the analyses are discussed in relation to fishery-dependent studies in the western North Atlantic, along with previous work on the biology and distribution of pelagic sharks. "
1285,2549,"Distribution, biology and fisheries importance of the pencil shark, Hypogaleus hyugaensis (Elasmobranchii: Triakidae), in the waters off south-western Australia","Distribution, biology and fishery importance of the pencil shark, Hypogaleus hyugaensis, off Western Australia was investigated using data from fishery observers and commercial fisheries landings. Observers collected data from 1823 gillnet sets and examined 516 specimens. The sex ratio was even and the majority of animals were greater than 84 cm fork length (FL). The size at maturity for males was estimated to be 82 cm FL, and for females to be 82-90 cm FL. Females have a two-year reproductive cycle. Ovulation occurs from March to May, with parturition probably occurring after a gestation period of less than 12 months. The size at birth was estimated to be 30-32 cm FL. Litter size ranged from 2 to 15, with a mean of 9.6. Pelagic teleosts and squid dominated the diet. Highest catch rates based on observer data occurred at depths between 50 and 80 m. Landings data indicate that H. hyugaensis make up approximately 0.5% of the shark catch in the fisheries off Western Australia. Steady catch rates since 1989 suggests that the fishery has had no impact on the population. Landings data and observer catch rate data show different patterns of seasonal and geographic distribution. However, landings data are probably unrepresentative of actual catches in the fisheries due to problems with identification and discarding."
1286,2255,Changes in the spatial structure of Grand Bank yellowtail flounder: testing MacCall's basin hypothesis,"MacCall's basin model postulates that the geographic range of marine fish will co-vary with population density as a function of habitat selection. Therefore the geographic range of a stock will increase with increasing abundance, while the opposite is true of declining stocks. In this paper we investigated range contraction, and expansion, in the distribution of yellowtail flounder on the Grand Banks in relation to sediment type, temperature and depth. Yellowtail flounder were mainly distributed on gravely sand, sand-shell hash, rock-sandy sediments an to a lesser extent on rocky bottoms. As well, yellowtail flounder are highly associated with shallow, warmer waters more frequently than expected based on its occurrence in the environment. Employing a generalised additive model (GAM), we modelled the spatial distribution of yellowtail flounder in association with the environmental variables. The GAM provided a reasonable fit to the spatial distribution of yellowtail (58% overall). During periods of lower abundance, the fit of the spatial model increased, demonstrating the importance of depth and temperature in influencing the distribution of this species. We concluded that the observed range contraction of yellowtail flounder at low population levels represents selection for preferred habitats, whereas during periods of stock increase, the range of yellowtail flounder expands into less favourable habitats in support of MacCall's basin hypothesis.

Detailed results are given for 67 fish species. The individual species trends were dominated by increases and this was particularly the case for flatfish species. Where the trends were downward, this was mainly for rockfish (Sebastes) species. The utility of these indices for stock assessment and species at risk purposes is discussed."
1288,1487,Long-Term Ecosystem Dynamics in the Serengeti:Lessons for Conservation,"Data from long-term ecological studies further understanding of ecosystem dynamics and can guide evidence-based management. In a quasi-natural experiment we examined long-term monitoring data on different components of the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem to trace the effects of disturbances and thus to elucidate cause-and-effect connections between them. The long-term data illustrated the role of food limitation in population regulation in mammals, particularly in migratory wildebeest and nonmigratory buffalo. Predation limited populations of smaller resident ungulates and small carnivores. Abiotic events, such as droughts and floods, created disturbances that affected survivorship of ungulates and birds. Such disturbances showed feedbacks between biotic and abiotic realms. Interactions between elephants and their food allowed savanna and grassland communities to co-occur. With increased woodland vegetation, predators' capture of prey increased. Anthropogenic disturbances had direct (hunting) and indirect (transfer of disease to wildlife) effects. Slow and rapid changes and multiple ecosystem states became apparent only over several decades and involved events at different spatial scales. Conservation efforts should accommodate both infrequent and unpredictable events and long-term trends. Management should plan on the time scale of those events and should not aim to maintain the status quo. Systems can be self-regulating through food availability and predator-prey interactions; thus, culling may not be required. Ecosystems can occur in multiple states; thus, there may be no a priori need to maintain one natural state. Finally, conservation efforts outside protected areas must distinguish between natural change and direct human-induced change. Protected areas can act as ecological baselines in which human-induced change is kept to a minimum "
1289,2347,Drastic population decline and conservation prospects of roadside dark-bellied bonnet macaques (&lt;i&gt;Macaca radiata radiata&lt;/i&gt;) of southern India,"We carried out a survey on roadside dark-bellied bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata radiata) on the highways around the south Indian city of Mysore. The present survey was the fourth since 1989 on the same populations. We divided the habitats into intensive cultivation (IC), wet cultivation (WC), and scrub forests (SC). The number of groups has significantly reduced from 54 to 31 and the number of animals has declined from 1,207 to 697 from 1989 to 2009. This decline has been recorded only in the IC and WC areas, whereas the population in SC with places of Hindu worship has remained stable. Due to the loss of roadside Ficus trees over the years, the habitat of the monkeys has almost disappeared. Since bonnet macaque is not primarily a forest-dwelling species, the seemingly widespread primate may soon become 'threatened' if the non-forest populations continue to decline. Scrub forests in small hillocks housing Hindu temples remain the only prospective places for conservation of bonnet macaques. "
1290,3113,Pacific Golden Plover distribution in Western Australia,"In this paper, important austral summer (non-breeding) sites of Pacific Golden Plover, Pluvialis fulva along the Western Australian coast are identified, and the northward and southward migration patterns are examined. The core range for the species was found to occur between Broome and Port Hedland, and on the adjacent off shore islands. A decline in Pacific Golden Plover numbers at several sites was documented."
1291,2771,"Changes in numbers and distribution of the northern gannet (Morus bassanus) on Rouzic Island, (Reserve Naturelle des Sept-Iles, Bretagne), France 1939-1994","This paper describes changes in numbers and distribution of Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus) on Rouzic Island from the colony's formation in 1939 to 1994. Rouzic is the only French gannetry and is currently the most southerly breeding location for the species. Population size and distribution were assessed by using land-based field counts, photographs taken from the sea and aerial photographs. Since its foundation, the colony has shown three periods of increase with average annual rates of increase of 28.1% (1947-65), 5.0% (1967-79) and 8.4% (198194). A Leslie simulation model indicates that, at least during the first and third periods, these increases were likely to have been sustained by net immigration of Northern Gannets to Rouzic. Compared to other gannetries of a similar age and size, Rouzic currently shows a high rate of population increase. In 1994, the colony held about 11,500 pairs and about 2,000 non breeders. At present, colony size is not limited by the availability of nesting habitat, but Northern Gannets will soon colonize the area occupied by the few Atlantic Puffins (Fratercula arctica) and Manx Shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus) still breeding on Rouzic. While this may cause the extinction of the Atlantic Puffin colony, there is no evidence that Northern Gannets have been responsible for the long term decline in Atlantic Puffin numbers."
1292,4625,Combinations of biological attributes predict temporal dynamics of fish species in response to environmental changes,"Assessing species vulnerability to environmental changes is a major challenge for conservation. Combinations of biological attributes have already been successfully used for this purpose, allowing large-scale prediction of inter-specific differences in demographic parameters (e.g. abundance) or endangered status. However, studies investigating whether biological attributes could be used to predict the temporal demographic responses of species in a changing environment are still scarce. In this work, we tackled this issue by taking advantage of a multi-decadal survey of concomitant changes in fish communities and environmental conditions within the Terminos lagoon (Mexico). Based on this rare dataset, we first characterized changes in abiotic parameters that occurred in this ecosystem since the 80s. Then, we adapted a multivariate index accounting for changes in both species abundance and occurrence to assess concomitant demographic changes for the 25 dominant fish species in the lagoon, classifying them into five various types of trajectories (""Increasing"" , ""Decreasing"", ""Constant"", ""Hump-shape"" and ""U-shape""). Finally, we assessed the accuracy in prediction of these temporal responses for all possible combinations of 15 biological attributes including taxonomy, ecological and life-history traits. Our results showed that fish specific demographic changes over the last 30 years could be accurately predicted (72% accuracy) using a combination of five biological attributes (spawning season, order, maximum salinity, width of salinity range, oocyte size) among which three could be related to the increase in average salinity occurred in the lagoon over this period. Appropriate sets of complementary biological attributes could similarly allow prediction of inter-specific differences in demographic changes in other areas, thereby offering an additional pragmatic tool for ecosystem managers to identify vulnerable species at the local scale.

1294,4592,Expansion of round gobies in a non-navigable river system,"A numberof Ponto-Caspian Gobiid species have greatly increased their geographical ranges over recent decades. Most expansion studies to date, however, have focused on navigable waterways. In this study, we present a summary of six-years (20082013) monitoring of round goby Neogobius melanostomus expansion along two connected non-navigable rivers. Contiguous range expansion was observed in both rivers, with dispersal rate ranging from 1.2 to 3.2 km/year. Gobies at newly invaded sites ranged from 20 to 117 mm, with both juveniles and adult ?sh observed. Though the data did not allow us to see any consistent pattern in the ?rst years after detection, there was some evidence for a shift to a female-biased, juvenile-dominated population over time. While the abundance of non-native tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris appeared to be negatively in?uenced by round goby establishment, diversity of nearshore native ?sh showed no evidence of dramatic decline attributable to round goby."
1295,1265,A model of ruddy duck Oxyura jamaicensis eradication for the UK,"1. Non-native species are the second most important threat to global biodiversity after habitat loss. The North American ruddy duck Oxyura jamaicensis established a feral population in the UK more than 40 years ago, and it is now threatening the endangered white-headed duck Oxyura leucocephala through hybridization. We utilized a simple generic model, which includes uncertainty in parameter estimates and can be used for any invasive species, to assess the time frame for successful control. 2. A simple spreadsheet-based model was produced to provide the UK government with an assessment of whether sufficient ruddy ducks could be culled to allow the UK population to be reduced to fewer than 175 individuals (> 97% population reduction) within 10 years. 3. Data on changes in numbers of ruddy duck at the main UK wintering sites were collected during a regional control trial, and a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation model was constructed to project the UK population under a variety of control strategies. Three variables were included in the model: cull rate per person (i.e. by how much each control officer could reduce the national population per year), number of control officers, and changes in the ruddy duck population growth rate as the population was reduced. 4. Parameter estimation was kept to a minimum by using historical annual population growth rates as a basis for future growth rates. The historical data show a reduction in both the mean growth rate and in its variability when the population is in excess of 2000 birds. Density-dependent and density-independent models were produced. These all gave similar times to reach the target population, with some difference in the variance estimates between models. 5. Simulations were run with a maximum annual population reduction of between 0.50 and 0.80, and between 12 and 20 control officers. A total of 8000 simulations was performed for each of the 63 different scenarios for each of the models. 6. The mean time to reduce the UK ruddy duck population by 97% was predicted to be between 3 and 5 years, with 14 or 15 control officers reducing the population by between 65% and 70% per year. There was an 80% certainty that the population could be reduced to this level by 16 control officers within 4-6 years if annual reductions of more than 60% were achieved. 7. Synthesis and applications. The novel spreadsheet model presented here can easily be applied to a range of eradication schemes where limited data are available on population size and culling efficacy. This would allow funding bodies to have a greater degree of certainty about the cost and outcome of a trial eradication programme. "
1296,2025,Changes in a turtle community from a northern Indiana lake: a long-term study,"Knowledge of the long-term dynamics of freshwater turtle communities is important if we are to understand fully the impacts of human-induced changes in their aquatic and terrestrial habitats. We present data on a turtle community that has been monitored intermittently for more than 20 years and regularly for more than 10 years (1992-2003). The composition of the community has shifted with a decrease in the dominance of Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta). This shift reflects a decline in the number of C. picta over the past decade, whereas numbers of other species have remained relatively constant. Adult survivorship of C. picta has declined in the past decade. The proportion of C. picta with watercraft propeller damage has increased, whereas propeller damage has remained constant for the two other species for which we have data, the Northern Map Turtle (Graptemys geographica) and the Red-Eared Slider (Trachemys scripta). Our study suggests that the turtle community in Dewart Lake has shifted from 1992-2003. It seems likely that this shift has occurred because of a decline in C. picta, possibly as a result of increased use of the lake by humans."
1297,1899,The provision of supplementary fresh water improves the breeding success of the globally threatened northern bald ibis Geronticus eremita,"The Northern Bald Ibis Geronticus eremita is a globally threatened species with its main remaining world population breeding in an area of sea cliffs and coastal semi-desert steppe near Agadir in southern Morocco. Between 1998 and 2002, we showed experimentally that the small-scale provision of fresh water near the breeding colonies led to an increase in the productivity of the birds. The increase was greatest in years with low natural rainfall but was positive in all years tested. The supplementary fresh water appears to help buffer productivity against the impacts of low rainfall and its provision is now part of the ongoing conservation measures for this species."
1298,4009,Flying squirrel demography varies between island communities with and without red squirrels,"Recent studies in Southeast Alaska suggest the ecology of Glaucomys sabrinus differs from populations in the Pacific; Northwest. In Southeast Alaska, densities were the highest reported for the species, populations were not as closely linked; to old-forest attributes, and individuals had a more diverse diet that was less dependent on mycophagy. Pacific Northwest; communities are comprised of several arboreal rodents; Southeast Alaska has a depauperate mammal fauna. I hypothesized; that Southeast Alaska populations had a broader realized niche because of competitive release. The red squirrel (Tamiasciurus; hudsonicus) is the only other arboreal squirrel and it is absent from the southern outer islands of Southeast Alaskas; Alexander Archipelago. I compared demography and body mass of G. sabrinus on Prince of Wales Island to a population; in sympatry with T. hudsonicus on a separate island (Mitkof). Home ranges were larger and population density, breeding; female density, and juvenile recruitment of G. sabrinus were all lower in sympatry with T. hudsonicus. In a companion; study, G. sabrinus on Prince of Wales Island used cavities for denning relatively more frequently than in sympatry with; T. hudsonicus on Mitkof Island. Female G. sabrinus depend on cavities for natal dens, ~tnd breeding female and popula.-; tion densities are positively correlated with large snag or tree density. The presence of T. hudsonicus may influence G.; sabrinus populations by limiting availability of cavities. Furthermore, variation in vertebrate assemblages among islands; may influence realized niches of resident species, which manifest unique demographic profiles compared to populations; of different ecological communities."
1299,4005,"Demography of the Prince of Wales flying squirrel, and endemic of southeastern Alaska temperate rain forest","We studied the Prince of Wales flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus griseifrons) in temperate; rain forest of southeastern Alaska to provide the 1st quantitative estimates of demography; from southeastern Alaska and test predictions of the hypothesis that Sitka spruce; (Picea sitchensis)western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) forest is primary habitat for G.; sabrinus in southeastern Alaska. We expected that abundance, body condition, productivity,; and summer and overwinter survival of G. sabrinus would be higher in sprucehemlock; forest (which typically are the old-growth forests of upland sites [upland-OG]) than in; peatland-scrubmixed-conifer (peatland-MC) forest. Mean values of minimum number of; animals known alive and density during autumn were higher in upland-OG than in peatland-; MC, and both were about 2 times higher than corresponding spring values. Age and sex; composition of the population was similar among years, between seasons, and between; habitats. Males comprised a larger portion of the population in upland-OG than in peatland-; MC forest. Mean body mass was similar between habitats. Minimum summer survival; varied among years and between habitats. Overwinter survival was less varied and similar; among years and between habitats. Reproductive females were more abundant in upland-; OG than in peatland-MC, but percentage of reproductive females during spring and percentage; of juveniles during autumn were similar between habitats. These results support; the conclusion that upland-OG forests of southeastern Alaska are primary habitat for northern; flying squirrels. Still, squirrel densities in peatland-MC were higher than those reported; for several managed and unmanaged forest types in the Pacific Northwest, and some demographic; parameters were similar between upland-OG and peatland-MC.

We trapped 1-ha grids; and assessment lines with live traps during spring and autumn to compare populations among gap-phase oldgrowth,; multicohort old-growth, peatland mixed-conifer, and thinned young-growth (23-year-old) forests.; Generally, gap-phase old growth and peatland mixed conifer supported the highest and lowest populations of voles,; respectively. One notable exception was during autumn 1998, when vole population levels were highest and; density was higher (P , 0.02) in young growth than gap-phase old growth. Mean body mass, minimum summer; and overwinter survival, age and sex composition, and percentage reproductive females did not differ among; habitats. For Keens mouse, density was highest in 1998; overall, populations were highest in young growth and; lowest in peatland mixed conifer. Mean body mass and minimum summer and overwinter survival did not differ; among habitats, but fewer reproductive females were recorded in multicohort than in gap-phase old growth,; peatland mixed conifer, or young growth. Our results suggest that C. gapperi populations in southeastern Alaska; are not as sensitive to canopy removal as has been indicated elsewhere in western coniferous forests and that; P. keeni populations in southeastern Alaska flourish in a variety of habitats. If the results of our study can be; generalized across southeastern Alaska, peatland mixed conifer likely contributes little to breeding populations of; C. gapperi and thus is unlikely to mitigate any effects of broad-scale clear-cut logging of old-growth forests."
1301,2363,Carnivore population trends in Spanish agrosystems after the reduction in food availability due to rabbit decline by rabbit haemorrhagic disease and improved waste management,"We conducted spotlight counts from 1992 to 2006 in 59 localities to describe carnivore presence, distribution and relative abundance in open agriculture lands in Aragon, northeastern Spain. During the study period, urban waste and carcases of domestic livestock became less available to wild animals, and rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) abundance was low after rabbit haemorragic disease. We calculated a kilometric abundance index (KAI, individuals seen per 100 km surveyed) and the ratio between the number of positive localities in which a species was detected and the total of localities surveyed in a year. Indices to abundance and presence included: red fox (Vulpes vulpes), KAI per 100 km 10.70 and 100.0% localities per year; stray dog (Canis familiaris), KAI 0.48 and 22.6% localities; wildcat (Felis silvestris), KAI 0.10 and 19.1% localities; domestic cat (Felis catus), KAI 0.21 and 20.6% localities; polecat (Mustela putorius), KAI 0.02 and 2.0% localities; badger (Meles meles), KAI 0.16 and 23.6% localities; stone marten (Martes foina), KAI 0.11 and 19.6% localities; weasel (Mustela nivalis), KAI 0.002 and 0.6% localities; and genet (Genetta genetta), KAI 0.06 and 10.0% localities. Indices of badger abundance increased significantly, whereas indices of stray dogs decreased significantly over the study period. Abundance indices of red fox, the most important predator of small game, were stable throughout the study period. No significant trend was observed to other studied species. This study concludes that Aragon region maintains a diverse and rather stable carnivore community and shows that large scale data may help to identify trends of the more abundant wild and feral carnivores.

1302,3819,Estimating the density of a jaguar population in the Brazilian Pantanal using camera-traps and capture–recapture sampling in combination with GPS radio-telemetry,"The jaguar (Panthera onca) is the largest feline in the Americas and third largest world-wide, smaller in size only to the tiger (P. tigris) and lion (P. leo). Yet, in comparison, relatively few studies on jaguar population densities have been conducted and baseline data for management purposes are needed. Camera trapping and capturerecapture sampling methods were used to estimate the size of a jaguar population in the Pantanals open wet grassland habitat, an important area for the long-term survival of the species. This study is the first jaguar population estimate conducted in co-operation with a GPS-telemetry study providing an important opportunity for comparing different methods of density estimation. An accessible area within a 460 km2 privately-owned ranch was sampled with equal effort during the dry seasons of 2003 and 2004. Thirty-one and twenty-five individual jaguars were identified in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Estimates of jaguar abundance were generated by program CAPTURE. Density estimates were produced according to different methods used to calculate the effectively sampled areas which ranged from 274 to 568 km2. For 2003, the currently-used mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) method produced a density of 10.3 jaguars/100 km2, while GPS-telemetry-based calculations produced a mean density of 6.6 jaguars/100 km2. For 2004, the MMDM method produced an estimate of 11.7 jaguars/100 km2 while GPS-telemetry calculations produced a density of 6.7 jaguars/100 km2. Our results suggest that the widely-used MMDM method used to calculate effectively sampled areas is significantly under-reflecting maximum distances moved by jaguars and their range-use and, thereby, considerably inflating cat density estimates. This overestimation could place a population in a difficult situation by lengthening the time taken to initiate protection measures because of underestimating the risk to that population."
1303,2745,Change-in-sex ratio as an estimator of population size for Norwegian moose Alces alces,"Effective management of ungulates requires regular estimates of population abundance, but these are often expensive and hard to obtain. We therefore examined if change-in-ratio (CIR) estimation methods, in combination with age- and sex-specific data on moose Alces alces observed and killed, could be a cheap alternative for estimating moose abundance in Norway. We used the large number of moose observations reported by moose hunters and estimated pre-harvest adult population size based on annual changes in adult sex ratio. Similarly, we estimated 1) annual recruitment rate based on the proportion of calves observed during the hunting season, 2) the harvest rate, and 3) the natural mortality rate based on variation in recruitment rate and harvest rate. During 1991-2000, annual variation in abundance was correlated with two of three independent indices of moose density, indicating that the CIR methods provide relatively precise estimates of abundance. Similarly, the estimated average natural mortality rate was similar to natural mortality rates of radio-collared moose in Scandinavia, and the estimated abundance was close to what we expected based on the annual harvest. However, large annual variation in estimated rates of natural mortality indicated that over- and underestimation of population abundance occurred for some years. This was likely due to the fact that harvesting occurred during periods of moose observations. Because we had no independent estimates of abundance, we were unable to estimate the bias. Hence, we concluded that variation in CIR abundance is a sensitive index of moose density, but that more studies are needed to determine the accuracy of CIR estimates as measurements of abundance. Future studies should focus on smaller populations with independent estimates on abundance, and base CIR estimation on changes in sex ratio within the hunting season to reduce the number of possible confounding effects."
1304,2349,Dynamics of Finnish starling Sturnus vulgaris populations in recent decades,"The population size started to decrease in the late 1960s, and fell to c20% by the early 1980s. In the timing of the decrease, there were clear regional and local differences. Clutch size varied significantly among local populations (range of the means of annual means in three populations: 4.7-5.3 eggs), but there were much greater differences in the number of fledglings (range in the same populations: 2.33-3.99 fledglings, with 3.52-4.87 for four other populations). These differences were caused by differences in foraging habitat. According to national ringing data, brood size at the age of ringing increased significantly (by 0.04 nestlings/year) during 1968-89. The mean brood size decreased towards the north, probably due to large-scale abandoning of dairy farming in S Finland. This has resulted in losses of good foraging habitats (pastures and leys) for the starlings, and, as consequence, to reduced reproductive success in the whole south Finnish population. -from Authors"
1305,2448,Quetzal abundance in relation to fruit availability in a cloud forest in southeastern Mexico,"The Resplendent Quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) is an altitudinal migrant that nests in high elevation cloud forests and migrates toward lower areas during the summer rainy season. It has been suggested that its migratory movements are related to the abundance of ripe Lauraceae fruits. We studied the quetzal diet during two consecutive years, as well as changes in fruit abundance of the plant species on which the bird feeds at El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, southeastern Mexico. The quetzal was observed feeding on 32 plant species; of these, 24 are new records in its diet. We chose 20 of these 32 species and studied their fruit phenology for two years in order to describe the relationship between fruit and quetzal abundance. Our results showed that quetzal abundance in the breeding area was correlated with the total number of fruiting species, whereas the correlation between quetzal abundance and the number of fruiting Lauraceae species was only marginal. Additionally, a correlation test showed that quetzal abundance was marginally correlated with total fruit availability (total no. of fruits per month); however, the correlation between quetzal abundance and the number of fruits in the Lauraceae was not significant. Our results suggest that the dynamics of food resources may be playing a major role in the quetzal's migratory behavior. Knowing the bird's diet may aid in characterizing the type of habitat adequate for its conservation. Our observations in this respect suggest that conservation efforts to preserve this bird species should concentrate on the protection of its habitat, including both breeding and nonbreeding (migration) locations."
1306,1649,The impact of sarcoptic mange Sarcoptes scabiei on the British fox Vulpes vulpes population,"1. Disease epizootics can significantly influence host population dynamics and the structure and functioning of ecological communities. Sarcoptic mange Sarcoptes scabiei has dramatically reduced red fox populations Vulpes vulpes in several countries, including Britain, although impacts on demographic processes are poorly understood. We review the literature on the impact of mange on red fox populations, assess its current distribution in Britain through a questionnaire survey and present new data on resultant demographic changes in foxes in Bristol, UK. 2. A mange epizootic in Sweden spread across the entire country in <10 years resulting in a decline in fox density of up to 95%; density remained lowered for 15-20 years. In Spain, mange has been enzootic for >75 years and is widely distributed; mange presence was negatively correlated with habitat quality. 3. Localized outbreaks have occurred sporadically in Britain during the last 100 years. The most recent large-scale outbreak arose in the 1990s, although mange has been present in south London and surrounding environs since the 1940s. The questionnaire survey indicated that mange was broadly distributed across Britain, but areas of perceived high prevalence (>50% affected) were mainly in central and southern England. Habitat type did not significantly affect the presence/absence of mange or perceived prevalence rates. Subjective assessments suggested that populations take 15-20 years to recover. 4. Mange appeared in Bristol's foxes in 1994. During the epizootic phase (1994-95), mange spread through the city at a rate of 0.6-0.9km/month, with a rise in infection in domestic dogs Canis familiaris c. 1-2months later. Juvenile and adult fox mortality increased and the proportion of females that reproduced declined but litter size was unaffected. Population density declined by >95%. 5. In the enzootic phase (1996-present), mange was the most significant mortality factor. Juvenile mortality was significantly higher than in the pre-mange period, and the number of juveniles classified as dispersers declined. Mange infection reduced the reproductive potential of males and females: females with advanced mange did not breed; severely infected males failed to undergo spermatogenesis. In 2004, Bristol fox population density was only 15% of that in 1994. "
1307,3193,Numbers of waders in New Zealand 1994-2003,"Populations of waders, especially migratory species, tend to be in decline; worldwide, and there has been concern for some time about the status of some; endemic species in New Zealand. Counts of waders in estuaries throughout; New Zealand were made during summer (NovemberDecember) and winter; (JuneJuly) from November 1994 to June 2003, and compared with results from; the previous decade. Populations of most species that breed in New Zealand; appeared to be stable or increasing, but banded dotterels (Charadrius bicinctus; bicinctus) had clearly declined. No species of Arctic migrant appeared to have; increased in number, and only eastern bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica; baueri) and pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos) appeared to have arrived; in similar numbers to the previous decade; numbers of the other species had; declined, some substantially. There were disproportionate local gains and losses; between sites in several species that suggest local habitat change. In winter,; lesser knots (Calidris canutus) had become much more concentrated on; Manukau Harbour and turnstones (Arenaria interpres) seemed to have moved; away from Southland.

1309,4019,Forest management affects individual and population parameters of the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius,"Several studies have shown that forest management (e.g. for timber production) affects mammal communities.; Nevertheless, we still lack a detailed understanding on how different management practices; influence individuals and populations. The overarching goal of our work was to investigate the demographic; response of the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) to forest management. We focused; on a set of key individual (survival and litter size) and population (abundance of individuals) parameters; to test whether forest management affects dormice and which habitat variables are responsible for; such effects. We surveyed a dormice population for 3 years in a continuous forest in central Italy including; sites subjected to different management regimes: 5 coppiced stands (2 recently coppiced and 3 old; coppice stands), 2 abandoned stands with regrowing forest and 3 high forest stands. We found a strong; effect of forest management on hazel dormice, acting mainly through the variation in food resources.; Regrowing forests were the most suitable stands for dormice, whereas recent coppices were the most; unsuitable, with an ephemeral presence of a few individuals. Old coppices and high forest stands were; both able to sustain local populations but at lower densities and with a higher mortality and/or emigration; of younger and/or weaker individuals than the regrowing forest. Through our detailed analyses; we were able to uncover the demographic mechanism underlying the effects of forest management on; hazel dormice populations; our findings strongly suggest that maintaining an heterogeneous successional; composition may be the most effective strategy for the conservation of this species."
1310,1378,Arabian oryx reintroduction in Oman: successes and setbacks,"The return of the Arabian oryx Oryx leucoryx to Oman symbolized the success of a new approach to species conservation and established reintroduction as a conservation tool. Ten years after the species had been exterminated in the wild by poaching, the first 10 founder oryx, descendants of the 'World Herd', were reintroduced to the desert in central Oman in January 1982. A second release followed in 1984 and the population grew slowly through a 3-year drought that was broken by rain in June 1986. Further years of good rainfall and more founders meant that by April 1990 there were over 100 oryx in the wild, independent of supplementary feed and water, and using a range of over 11,000 sq km. At that time a new monitoring programme was implemented that allowed the transition from individual- to population-based monitoring and management. The population continued to grow and by October 1995 numbered approximately 280 in the wild (of which 22 were surviving founders) and used over 16,000 sq km of the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary. However, in February 1996 poaching resumed and oryx were captured for sale as live animals outside the country. Despite the poaching the population continued to increase and by October 1996 was estimated to be just over 400. However, poaching intensified and continued through late 1996 and 1997. By September 1998 it had reduced the wild population to an estimated 138 animals, of which just 28 were females. The wild population was no longer considered viable and action was taken to rescue some of the remaining animals from the wild to form a captive herd."
1311,4552,Evidence for rapid recovery of shark populations within a coral reef marine protected area,"There is limited evidence on the rate at which the shark populations of coral reefs can rebound from over-exploitation, the baselines that might signify when recovery has occurred and the role of no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in aiding this process. We surveyed shark assemblages at Ashmore Reef in Western Australia using baited remote underwater video stations in 2004 prior to enforcement of MPA status and then again in 2016 after eight years of strict enforcement. We found an increase in the relative mean abundance of Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos from 0.16 ± 0.06 individuals h−1 in 2004 to 0.74 ± 0.11 individuals h−1 in 2016, a change that was also accompanied by a shift in the assemblage of sharks to greater proportions of apex species (from 7.1% to 11.9%) and reef sharks (from 28.6% to 57.6%), and a decrease in the proportional abundance of lower trophic level species (from 64.3% to 30.5%). Abundances and trophic assemblage of sharks at Ashmore Reef in 2004 resembled those of the Scott Reefs, where targeted fishing for sharks still occurs, whereas in 2016, abundances and trophic structures had recovered to resemble those of the Rowley Shoals, a reef system that has been a strictly enforced MPA for over 25 years. The shift in abundance and community structure coincident with strict enforcement of the MPA at Ashmore Reef has occurred at a rate greater than predicted by demographic models, implying the action of compensatory processes in recovery. Our study shows that shark communities can recover rapidly after exploitation in a well-managed no-take MPA."
1312,2619,Estimating Orangutan Densities Using the Standing Crop and Marked Nest Count Methods: Lessons Learned for Conservation,"Reliable estimates of great ape abundance are needed to assess distribution, monitor population status, evaluate conservation tactics, and identify priority populations for conservation. Rather than using direct counts, surveyors often count ape nests. The standing crop nest count (SCNC) method converts the standing stock of nests into animal densities using a set of parameters, including nest decay rate. Nest decay rates vary greatly over space and time, and it takes months to calculate a site-specific value. The marked nest count (MNC) method circumvents this issue and only counts new nests produced during a defined period. We compared orangutan densities calculated by the two methods using data from studies in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia. We show how animal densities calculated using nest counts should be cautiously interpreted when used to make decisions about management or budget allocation. Even with site-specific decay rates, short studies using the SCNC method may not accurately reflect the current population unless conducted at a scale sufficient to include wide-ranging orangutan movement. Density estimates from short studies using the MNC method were affected by small sample sizes and by orangutan movement. To produce reliable results, the MNC method may require a similar amount of effort as the SCNC method. We suggest a reduced reliance on the traditional line transect surveys in favor of feasible alternative methods when absolute abundance numbers are not necessary or when site-specific nest decay rates are not known. Given funding constraints, aerial surveys, reconnaissance walks, and interview techniques may be more cost-effective means of accomplishing some survey goals. Abstract in Indonesian is available at "
1313,2068,"Patterns in the abundance of white-bellied sea-eagles (Haliaeetus leucogaster) in Jervis Bay, south-eastern Australia","Between 2001 and 2003, we undertook 137 boat surveys for White-bellied Sea-Eagles, to investigate the abundance and distribution in Jervis Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Adult sighting rates differed between years, being highest in 2003, and both adult and sub-adult Sea-Eagle numbers differed between seasons. High sighting rates of sub- adults each autumn ( April) were thought to reflect not only the appearance of locally fledged juveniles but also an influx of immature birds (2 - 4 years old) from outside the study area. Although it was common to observe single adult birds and pairs throughout the year, influxes of sub- adults in autumn generally led to an increase in observed group size. The largest group of Sea-Eagles observed contained eight individuals and most groups larger than two contained both adults and sub-adults. Observability was related to age-class and behaviour, with perching behaviour common in adults but relatively rare for sub-adults. The density of Sea-Eagles, and sub-adults in particular, was highest on the undeveloped northern and southern headlands, which are military and conservation reserves, compared with the urban settlements on the western shore of the study area. Furthermore, Sea-Eagles were only observed perching in forest reserves interspersed between urbanised areas, despite the appearance of suitable perches throughout the coastal suburbs. In view of these results, we discuss the possible implications for management of Sea-Eagle habitat"

A sharp decline in numbers has been observed since 2010 (96%;P < 0.01), but we were unable; to attribute this to any known cause of amphibian decline, such as chytridiomycosis, ranavirus or habitat degradation. The; present work describes this enigmatic decline, and we discuss these results in the context of possible causes."
1315,1915,Worldwide population decline of Dermochelys coriacea: are leatherback turtles going extinct?,"We estimated the number of leatherbacks, Dermochelys coriacea, nesting on 28 beaches throughout the world from the literature and from communications with investigators studying those beaches. The estimated worldwide population of leatherbacks in 1995 was about 34,500 females on these beaches with a lower limit of about 26,200 and an upper limit of about 42,900. This is less than one third the 1980 estimate of 115,000. Leatherbacks are rare in the Indian Ocean and in very low numbers in the western Pacific Ocean. The largest population is in the western Atlantic. We used an age-based demographic model to answer ""what if?"" questions about the stability of leatherback populations. We formulated a hypothetical life table model based on estimated ages of sexual maturity at 5 or 15 years. Leatherbacks that mature in 5 years would exhibit much greater population fluctuations in response to external factors than would turtles that mature in 15 years. Simulations indicated that leatherbacks would maintain a stable population only if both juvenile and adult survivorship remained high. If other life stages (egg, hatchling, juvenile) remain static, stable leatherback populations could not withstand an increase in adult mortality above natural background levels without decreasing. However, protection of eggs during incubation and hatchlings during their first day of life (potentially doubling survival) could have a significant effect on overall stability of leatherback populations in the face of an increase in adult mortality. Leatherback populations in the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean cannot withstand even moderate levels of adult mortality. Even the Atlantic populations are being exploited at a rate that cannot be sustained. Leatherbacks are on the road to extinction and further population declines can be expected unless we take action to reduce adult mortality and increase survival of eggs and hatchlings."
1316,3001,Population size and survival in the Indian false vampire bat Megaderma lyra,"We used the Jolly-Seber method to analyze mark-recapture data and estimate both survival and population size in the Indian false vampire bat Megaderma lyra in Madurai (South India). Population size of bats from 2001 to 2003 varied from 379 to 476, and showed fluctuation in numbers for both sexes. The mean (±SE) survival rate of females (1.26 ± 0.33) exceeded that of males (1.02 ± 0.16) although the differences were not statistically significant. We observed a gradual decline in reproduction as indicated by the number of pups born in each year. This was consistent with a declining trend in population size from 1995 to 2003. We hypothesize a few reasons for this fall in population size, including habitat destruction and human poaching of bats. "
1317,2345,"Primate population decline in response to habitat loss: Borajan Reserve Forest of Assam, India","Systematic studies of the Borajan Reserve Forest in Assam, India, were conducted in 1995, 1997, and 1998. Initially this small (5 km2) forest was inhabited by substantial numbers of five species of diurnal primates and the forest was typical of Reserve Forests in northwest upper Assam. About two thirds of the forest had canopy cover of 20 - 50% or more. Civil unrest, political problems and a lack of resources for Forest Department personnel, however, resulted in rapid degradation of the area. After three years less than one third of the forest had more than 20% canopy cover; all primate populations had declined dramatically and the small percentage of juveniles in each species indicated that all were in imminent danger of local extinction. There was no evidence of hunting or trapping nor any large scale logging. Forest degradation was due primarily to small scale harvesting of forest products, selective cutting, and collection of firewood. Although only hand tools were employed, the forest inexorably declined in response to these steady pressures. Borajan may be an object lesson as to what can happen but it need not be the harbinger of Assam's future."
1318,2141,"Drastic reduction of the white perch, Morone americana, population in the James River, Virginia","The white perch population in the James River declined to near extinction by the summer of 1971. Only several individuals were captured after extensive trawling and beach seining in 1972 and 1973, whereas similar effort yielded thousands in previous years. The commercial catch simultaneously dropped to an all time low. The cause of the population plummet apparently was a massive fish kill in May of 1971. The precise cause of the fish kill was not determined. "

Studies need to incorporate these factors with long-term data in order to link climate change to population abundance. We used 40 years of lizard abundance data and local climate data from Barro Colorado Island to ask how climate, total lizard abundance and cohort-specific abundance have changed over time, and how total and cohort-specific abundance relate to climate variables including those predicted to make the species vulnerable to climate change (i.e. temperatures exceeding preferred body temperature). We documented a decrease in lizard abundance over the last 40 years, and changes in the local climate. Population growth rate was related to the previous years southern oscillation index; increasing following cooler-wetter, <italic>la niña</italic> years, decreasing following warmer-drier, <italic>el nino</italic> years. Within-year recruitment was negatively related to rainfall and minimum temperature. This study simultaneously identified climatic factors driving long-term population fluctuations and climate variables influencing short-term annual recruitment, both of which may be contributing to the population decline and influence the populations future persistence.</p>"
1320,1658,"Community Structure of Large Mammals in Tropical Montane and Lowland Forest in the Tenasserim-Dawna Mountains, Thailand","Montane evergreen forest in SE Asia is structurally and floristically different from lowland habitats. The response of large mammals to this variation is largely unexplored. We used sign transects to compare community structure of large mammals in montane (>1100 m), and lowland (<1100 m) forest types over 4 yr in western Thailand. Relative abundance of most ungulate species was significantly higher in lowland forest, except for elephant (Elephas maximus) and tapir (Tapirus indicus), which were most abundant in montane forest (based on chi-square tests of sign encounter rates). Sexual segregation was apparent for gaur (Bos gaurus): breeding herds were concentrated in the lowlands, whereas single males were most abundant in montane forest. Large cat abundance was similar in both elevation zones. Tapir, single gaur, and bears (Ursus spp.) characterized the montane mammal community, whereas most other ungulate species and social groups were indicative of lowland forest (based on discriminant function analysis). Results pertain only to the dry season; seasonal movements could alter the patterns we observed. Differences in community structure between elevation zones are hypothesized to result from differences in habitat structure, resource availability, and human impacts. Lowland forests provide bamboo, grass, and mineral licks, probably accounting for higher ungulate densities despite higher levels of hunting. These resources are scarce in montane forest. However, montane forest functions as a refuge for at least three globally threatened large mammal species, because commercial hunting is concentrated in the more accessible lowlands. "
1321,2350,Population recovery patterns of Southeast Asian ungulates after poaching,"Large ungulate populations in Southeast Asia have collapsed due to commercial poaching, but little is known about patterns of population recovery after poaching has been controlled. Using a sign-based index of abundance, we measured 6-year trends in abundance and habitat use of five ungulate species after poaching ceased at a site in Thailand. Regression slopes of annual indices against time indicated population growth rates (r) of 0.44 and 0.31 for muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) and gaur (Bos gaurus), respectively-close to the intrinsic rates of natural increase for similarly-sized ungulates. Thus, muntjac and gaur can recover relatively rapidly from low population levels. In contrast, sambar (Cervus unicolor) remained consistently rare despite freedom from hunting, perhaps because prime males had been selectively targeted for trophies, disrupting the species mating system. Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) were already relatively abundant when monitoring started, illustrating their resilience to hunting and ability to quickly recolonize disturbed areas. Gaur herds (the key demographic unit of the population) and muntjac consistently selected deciduous over evergreen forest as their populations increased, revealing the importance of food-rich deciduous forest in driving recovery of these species. The unexpected failure of sambar to recover suggests that reproductive behavior may override seemingly positive interventions (i.e., stopping poaching) that reduce mortality. Small but well-protected recovery zones set within forested areas might help propel population recovery of ungulates and increase the prey base for endangered tigers. "
1322,4441,"POPULATION SIZE, DISTRIBUTION, AND BEHAVIOR OF INDO-PACIFIC BOTTLENOSE (TURSIOPS ADUNCUS) AND HUMPBACK (SOUSA CHINENSIS) DOLPHINS OFF THE SOUTH COAST OF ZANZIBAR"," Indo-Pacific bottlenose (Tursiops aduncus) and humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) off the south coast of Zanzibar, East Africa, have been subject to both direct and indirect takes as well as disturbance from local dolphin tourism during the last decade. Meanwhile, little or no information on population parameters exists for these animals. In order to assess the anthropogenic threats, a study was conducted between 1999 and 2002 to determine population sizes, distribution, and behavior of these animals. Population sizes were calculated for each year using mark-recapture methods applied to photo-identification data. The estimates ranged between 136 and 179 for the bottlenose dolphins and between 58 and 65 for the humpback dolphins in the calculated 26 km2 study area. Patterns in distribution and behavior were investigated using image and spatial statistic software on data from boat surveys. Analyses of spatial densities showed that both species concentrated their activities to smaller areas (2%11.5%) within the study area. When the study results were considered in light of the anthropogenic threats, it was clear that immediate conservation measures were needed. This is critical if the negative impact on the species is to be minimized and the dolphins are to continue to represent a socioeconomic resource in the region."
1323,865,"Impact of livestock and settlement on the large mammalian wildlife of Bale Mountains National Park, southern Ethiopia.","Large mammals, both wild and domestic, were censused in four study areas in Bale Mountains National Park (BMNP), southern Ethiopia, from April until August 1997, using established road counts, horse-back counts and systematic transects, a new approach to censusing large mammals in BMNP. Data collected since 1983 were also examined to indicate trends in mammalian abundance. Civil unrest following the government changeover in 1991 disrupted management of BMNP, leading to an increase in human settlement and livestock densities. The effect of these factors on BMNP's wildlife is assessed and discussed. Most large mammalian wildlife has declined since 1983 but signs of recovery for some species in recent years are positive. The fates of two charismatic endemics are emphasised. BMNP's current population of mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni, an endangered antelope) was estimated to be between 1100 and 1300. This is lower than estimates for the late 1980s, but shows an increase from very low levels recorded following social turmoil during the government changeover in 1991. Data on the Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis, a critically endangered canid) also indicate positive trends in abundance, following severe declines between 1989 and 1992 due to rabies epizootics. Action to reduce human utilisation of parts of BMNP is urgently required to prevent further degradation of the environment and to safeguard the future of both the mountain nyala and Ethiopian wolf. "
1324,4275,Climate change impacts on the conservation outlook of populations on the poleward periphery of species ranges: A case study of Canadian black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus),"Given climate change, species' climatically suitable habitats are increasingly expected to shift poleward. Some imperilled populations towards the poleward edge of their species' range might therefore conceivably benefit from climate change. Interactions between climate and population dynamics may be complex, however, with climate exerting effects both indirectly via influence over food availability and more directly, via effects on physiology and its implications for survival and reproduction. A thorough understanding of these interactions is critical for effective conservation management. We therefore examine the relationship between climate, survival and reproduction in Canadian black-tailed prairie dogs, a threatened keystone species in an imperilled ecosystem at the northern edge of the species' range. Our analyses considered 8 years of annual markrecapture data (20072014) in relation to growing degree days, precipitation, drought status and winter severity, as well as year, sex, age and body mass. Survival was strongly influenced by the interaction of drought and body mass class, and winter temperature severity. Female reproductive status was associated with the interaction of growing degree days and growing season precipitation, with spring precipitation and with winter temperature severity. Results related to body mass suggested that climatic variables exerted their effects via regulation of food availability with potential linked effects of food quality, immunological and behavioural implications, and predation risk. Predictions of future increases in drought conditions in North America's grassland ecosystems have raised concerns for the outlook of Canadian black-tailed prairie dogs. Insights gained from the analyses, however, point to mitigating species management options targeted at decoupling the mechanisms by which climate exerts its negative influence. Our approach highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between climate and population dynamics in peripheral populations whose viability might ultimately determine their species' ability to track climatically suitable space."
1325,938,"Threespine, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and Fourspine, Apeltes quadracus, Sticklebacks in the Lake Superior basin","The Threespine (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and Fourspine (Apeltes quadracus) sticklebacks are unintentionally introduced species to Lake Superior with initial populations established near Thunder Bay, Ontario. An examination of annual seining and trawling records show that native sticklebacks have declined in abundance in their native habitats as a result of these introductions. Assuming a single colonization event for Lake Superior, the distribution of Gasterosteus has been extended to the Black River, Ontario, in the east as well as both the Minnesota and Michigan coasts of Lake Superior. Apeltes quadracus is not known from Great Lakes populations outside of Lake Superior. However, specimens have been collected in Lake Superior waters distant from Thunder Bay. Gasterosteus has spread rapidly while Apeltes has not spread as quickly. Apeltes, due to its preference for nearshore areas, has the greatest potential to affect the native fish community negatively. This may occur through competition for habitat and food resources which carl ultimately change the food web structure."

1327,4575,Impact of increasing market access on a tropical small-scale fishery,"Small-scale fisheries have historically been marginalized in management and policy investments, and they often remain under-reported in national economic and fisheries statistics. Even so, small-scale fisheries are not entirely buffered from the impacts of globalization, such as the introduction and expansion of markets. This study measures the long-term impact of market-access on a coastal fishery on Nicaragua[U+05F3]s remote Atlantic Coast from approximately the time when fishermen had access to stable and predictable local markets until the present, when the region has been transformed by road connection. In the last four years, fisheries trade has expanded as road connection has facilitated export to distant markets. Fishery-independent surveys were used to measure changes in indicators of fish-community status such as length-frequency, mean trophic level, and relative biomass. Species-level changes in relative biomass of common snook Centropomus undecimalis and gafftopsail catfish Bagre marinus were also evaluated since these species are the most economically valuable and likely account for the most fish biomass in the system. Using historical records, reports, current observations and interviews, changes in indicators of fishing intensity and market access over the past 17 years were assessed. From 1994 to 2011, community and species-specific metrics of the lagoon fishery declined significantly across all indicators examined. The potential social and economic outcomes of the decline in the fishery are far-reaching for the region, because this tropical fishery comprises the main source of protein and income for residents of twelve indigenous and Afro-descendent communities.

1329,1517,North Atlantic humpback whale abundance and rate of increase four decades after protection from whaling.,"Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae in the North Atlantic Ocean were severely depleted by exploitation. With legal protection since 1955, substantial recovery is likely to have occurred, but information on abundance and rates of increase has been limited. We present an assessment of humpback whale abundance in the North Atlantic Ocean based upon capture-recapture estimates using naturally marked individuals. These data result from a long-term collaborative effort combining large-scale dedicated projects and incidental data collection, leading to extensive geographical coverage. The application of robust statistical techniques produces estimates of greater accuracy and precision than has previously been possible. Abundance estimates ranging from 5930 to 12 580 individuals, with coefficients of variation (CVs) from 0.07 to 0.39, were calculated for the West Indies breeding population using data from 1979 to 1993. The most precise estimate for the West Indies breeding population is 10 752 (CV = 0.068) for 1992 and 1993. Due to application of new analytical methods, these estimates are larger and more precise than those previously published from similar time periods. The average rate of increase for the West Indies breeding population over a 14 yr period was estimated to be 0.031 (SE = 0.005). The best available estimate for the entire North Atlantic population of humpback whales is 11 570 (95 % CI 10 290 to 13 390) based upon samples from 1992 and 1993. However, this estimate may be biased downwards to an unknown extent due to heterogeneity in capture probabilities that do not influence the West Indies estimates."
1330,930,"Predation and production by Salmonine fishes in Lake Michigan, 1978-88","A marked decline of alewife Alosa pseudoharengus in Lake Michigan during 1981-83 led to diet shifts by coho Oncorhynchus kisutch and chinook salmon O. tshawystscha from feeding primarily on large alewife to eating proportionately more immature alewives and other prey. Diets of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush did not change greatly during that period. Population biomass conversion efficiency averaged 24.5% for coho and 16.6% for lake trout. Chinook salmon suffered an apparent 20% decline in gross conversion efficiency of biomass (25.1 to 20.8%) and a 25% decline in average weight of sport-caught fish. Chinook salmon growth was apparently inhibited by insufficient forage available to them. A simulation of chinook salmon feeding on bloater Coregonus hoyi at 8°C suggested that such behaviour could lead to further declines in growth rates. Extension of modeling results to include approximations for brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout O. mykiss revealed peaks in total annual salmonine predation of 71 000 t in 1983 and 76 000 t in 1987. The alewife was 70% of all prey eaten by salmonines in 1987-88. Lakewide gross production by salmonines was 15 300 t (or 0.27 g.m-2) in 1987. Ratios of annual gross production to average monthly population biomass were 1.6 for chinook, 1.15 for coho, and only 0.6 for lake trout. -Authors"
1331,3545,"Increased nesting, good survival and variable site fidelity for leatherback turtles in Florida, USA","Despite facing serious threats of extinction in the Eastern Pacific, the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) appears to be thriving in the Atlantic basin based on increasing nest counts at several rookeries. In particular, Florida's nest numbers have been increasing by 10.2% per year since standardized counts began in 1979. The US Recovery Plan for leatherbacks calls for vital rates and population parameters to be determined for the three leatherback rookeries under US jurisdiction: St. Croix (USVI), Puerto Rico, and the east coast of Florida. Based on mark-recapture data gathered over eleven years, we determined important population parameters for nesting female leatherbacks at Juno Beach, one of the most densely nested beaches in Florida. Average annual survival was 88.9%. The average female nesting population size for Juno Beach is estimated at 100. ±. 41 individuals each season; statewide we expect the estimate to be higher. The average remigration interval was 2.7. ±. 1.0. years. In addition, we report observed clutch frequency (2.1. ±. 1.4 clutches/year), estimated clutch frequency (4.4. ±. 1.1 nests/year), and observed internesting period (10.2. ±. 1.3. days between nests). The probability of observing an individual female at least once during the season was 73.0%, likely due to variable site fidelity, even though sea turtles do exhibit natal homing. Using opportunistic observations at additional beaches, we found that 72 females observed nesting within the Juno Beach study area were also observed nesting outside the study area. Thirty-three individuals laid clutches both inside and outside the survey area within a single season; these nests were separated by as much as 463.5. km. Although the population in Florida is relatively small compared to other rookeries throughout the Western Atlantic, it is increasing at such a rapid pace that it has the potential to become more important regionally, thereby contributing to the abundance of leatherbacks in the Atlantic.

1332,3444,"Estimates of minimum population size for Walrus near southeast Baffin Island, Nunavut","To support management objectives in Canada and Greenland, joint research between the Department of  Fisheries and Oceans and Greenland Institute of Natural Resources was begun in 2005. Direct counts were used to determine the Minimum Counted Population (MCP) in summer around SE Baffin Island. Aerial surveys examined the coast from roughly the Saddleback Island in northern Hudson Strait to Isabella Bay on eastern Baffin Island but concentrated on the area between Loks Land and Cape Dyer. The maximum count was obtained on 34 September 2007 during boat surveys. The MCP ranged from 716 (in 2006) to 1,056 (2007). Using the largest MCP adjusted with published maximum estimates of the proportion of walrus hauled out concurrently, we estimated 1,420 (95% CI: 1,2191,622) walrus were present. In addition, four walrus had been fitted with satellite relayed data logger tags prior to the maximum counts in 2007. Using the simple proportion of tags dry on 3 September to adjust counts on 3 and 4 September 2007 provided an estimate of 2,102 (CI = MCP-4,482). Using the proportion of time dry immediately preceding the survey to adjust the maximum count produced an estimate of 2,502 (CI = 1,6603,345) walrus were present in Hoare Bay. We conclude approximately 2,1002,500 walrus were present in Hoare Bay in late summer 2007. This number is a negatively biased estimator of the population of walrus around SE Baffin Island and in the Hudson BayDavis Strait stock as a whole. Broader survey coverage in a short period and more detailed information on the movement of walrus between Greenland and Canada and the summer dispersal of these animals within Canada are required to improve population estimates."
1333,3445,"Use of multiple methods to estimate Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) abundance in the Penny Strait-Lancaster Sound and West Jones Sound Stocks, Canada","Surveys to estimate walrus abundance at terrestrial haulout sites in the Penny Strait-Lancaster Sound (PS-LS) and West Jones Sound (WJS) stocks were conducted in 1977 and 1998-2009. The Minimum Counted Population (MCP) was similar in 1977 (565) to recent years (557) for the PS-LS stock. The MCP for the WJS stock was higher in recent surveys (404) than in 1977 (290). Regression analysis of MCP and density (number of walrus divided by number of haulouts surveyed) showed no significant trends over time. We also calculated bounded count estimates for comparison. Finally, we used broad-scale behavioural data to estimate the proportion of the total stock that could be considered countable, to produce two adjusted estimates. We selected recent surveys with good coverage and ignored adjusted estimates that were lower than MCP. For the PS-LS stock, the adjusted MCP (with 95% CL) was 672 (575-768) and 727 (623-831) walrus in 2007 and 2009, respectively. For WJS, the best estimates were the adjusted MCP of 503 (473-534) in 2008 and the adjusted bounded count of 470 (297-1732) in 2009. While both stocks appear to have remained stable over three decades, differences in survey coverage and possible differences in walrus distribution make precise population estimation difficult."
1334,3293,"Assessing waterbird conservation objectives: An example for the Burry Inlet, UK","We use an individual-based model to assess the conservation objectives for knot Calidris canutus L. and; oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus L. on the Burry Inlet Special Protection Area (SPA), UK. Population; monitoring has identified a decline in oystercatcher numbers, but cannot determine whether this is; due to a decline in site quality. Long term data on cockle stocks show that the biomass of the large-sized; cockles consumed by oystercatcher declined after 2004, whereas a similar decline was not observed in; the smaller cockles consumed by knot. The model postdicts that during the winters of 2005/2006 to; 2008/2009 the site was unable to support the number of oystercatcher present at the time it was designated; (i.e. the SPA population). Large cockle biomass remained low during 2009/2010, but increases in; mussel biomass meant that the model postdicted that the site could support the SPA population of oystercatcher.; Knot food supplies remained high during most years, except 2008/2009 during which the; model postdicted that the SPA population could not be supported. The model postdicted that the stock; reserved for oystercatchers after shellfishing needed to be 24 times the amount consumed by the birds; in order to support the bird population. We recommend that where necessary, the conservation objectives; of waterbirds should be assessed using a combination of thorough population size and behaviour; monitoring to identify sites with population declines, and individual-based modelling on these sites to; determine whether reduction in site quality may contribute to the site-specific population decline."
1335,848,Polar bears and seals in the eastern Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf: A synthesis of population trends and ecological relationships over three decades,"In the eastern Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf, research on polar bear populations and their ecological interrelationships with seals and sea ice conditions began in the fall of 1970. Analysis of movement data from mark-recapture studies and tracking of adult female bears with satellite radio collars indicated that there are two populations of polar bears in the area, one that inhabits the west coast of Banks Island and Amundsen Gulf and a second that is resident along the mainland coast from about Baillie Islands in Canada to approximately Icy Cape in Alaska. Polar bears throughout the Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf were severely overharvested before the establishment of quotas in Canada in 1968 and the cessation of all but subsistence polar bear hunting in Alaska in 1972. Since then, both populations have recovered, and the population estimates currently used for management purposes are 1200 and 1800 for the Northern and Southern Beaufort populations, respectively. However, these population estimates are now dated and should be redone. Most female polar bears in the Beaufort Sea breed for the first time at 5 years of age, compared to 4 years of age in most other populations, and cubs normally remain with their mothers for 2.5 years prior to weaning. Heavy ice conditions in the mid-1970s and mid-1980s caused significant declines in productivity of ringed seals, each of which lasted about 3 years and caused similar declines in the natality of polar bears and survival of subadults, after which reproductive success and survival of both species increased again. The changes in the sea ice environment, and their consequent effects on polar bears, are demonstrable in parallel fluctuations in the mean ages of polar bears killed each year by Inuit hunters. In 1989, the decadal-scale pattern in fluctuations of ice conditions in the eastern Beaufort Sea changed in response to oceanographic and climatic factors, and this change has resulted in greater amounts of open water in recent years. In addition, climatic warming will be a major environmental factor if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase. It is unknown whether the ecosystem will return to the pattern of decadal-scale change exhibited in previous decades, or how polar bears and seals will respond to ecological changes in the future, but research on these topics is a high priority."
1336,847,Long-term trends in the population ecology of Polar bears in western Hudson Bay in relation to climatic change,"From 1981 through 1998, the condition of adult male and female polar bears has declined significantly in western Hudson Bay, as have natality and the proportion of yearling cubs caught during the open water period that were independent at the time of capture. Over this same period, the breakup of the sea ice on western Hudson Bay has been occurring earlier. There was a significant positive relationship between the time of breakup and the condition of adult females (i.e., the earlier the breakup, the poorer the condition of the bears). The trend toward earlier breakup was also correlated with rising spring air temperatures over the study area from 1950 to 1990. We suggest that the proximate cause of the decline in physical and reproductive parameters of polar bears in western Hudson Bay over the last 19 years has been a trend toward earlier breakup, which has caused the bears to come ashore in progressively poorer condition. The ultimate factor responsible for the earlier breakup in western Hudson Bay appears to be a long-term warming trend in April-June atmospheric temperatures."
1337,536,"History, migration and present status of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae at Bermuda","Historical accounts show that humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae have frequented Bermuda waters, which are located half-way between wintering and summering grounds in the western North Atlantic, since the early 17th century. There were more humpbacks present in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries than there are today. It also appears that humpback whales utilised the Bermuda area from February to May during these centuries, while today they occur at Bermuda for only three to four weeks in April. Humpbacks probably used Bermuda as a breeding ground in winter during these previous centuries and it may be an area that will be repopulated during winter if and when the population recovers from over-hunting. Using the distinctive pattern of pigmentation on the under-sides of the tail flukes, 104 individual humpback whales were identified at Bermuda and 44 of these have also been seen at other locations, including all the major summering and wintering grounds in the western North Atlantic. Chi-square analysis of these resighting shows that the whales occur at Bermuda in the expected proportions, relative to the samples, from the summering and wintering grounds. Contemporary utilisation of Bermuda by humpbacks is as a mid-ocean habitat through which all members of the western North Atlantic population migrate during spring. There is also evidence suggesting that humpback whales feed at Bermuda on deep water scattering layers during their stop-over. "
1338,3818,Food supply and poaching limit giraffe abundance in the Serengeti,"The iconic giraffe, an ecologically important browser, has shown a substantial decline in numbers across Africa since the 1990s. In Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, giraffes reached densities of 1.52.6 individuals km-2 in the 1970s coincident with a pulse of Acacia tree recruitment. However, despite continued increases in woody cover between the 1980s and the 2000s, giraffe recruitment and survival rates have declined and density has dropped to only 0.30.4 giraffes km-2. We used a decision table to investigate how four extrinsic factors may have contributed to these declines: food supply, predation, parasites, and poaching, which have all been previously shown to limit Serengeti ungulate populations. Lower recruitment likely resulted from a reduction in diet quality, owing to the replacement of preferred trees with unpalatable species, while decreased adult survival resulted from illegal harvesting, which appears to have had a greater impact on giraffe populations bordering the western and northern Serengeti. The Serengeti giraffe population will likely persist at low-to-moderate densities until palatable tree species regain their former abundance. Leslie matrix models suggest that park managers should meanwhile redouble their efforts to reduce poaching, thereby improving adult survival."
1339,4106,"Guns, germs, and trees determine density and distribution of gorillas and chimpanzees in Western Equatorial Africa","We present a range-wide assessment of sympatric western lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla gorilla and central chimpanzees Pan troglodytes troglodytes using the largest survey data set ever assembled for these taxa: 59 sites in five countries surveyed between 2003 and 2013, totaling 61,000 person-days of fieldwork. We used spatial modeling to investigate major drivers of great ape distribution and population trends. We predicted density across each taxons geographic range, allowing us to estimate overall abundance: 361,900 gorillas and 128,700 chimpanzees in Western Equatorial Africasubstantially higher than previous estimates. These two subspecies represent close to 99% of all gorillas and one-third of all chimpanzees. Annual population decline of gorillas was estimated at 2.7%, maintaining them as Critically Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List. We quantified the threats to each taxon, of which the three greatest were poaching, disease, and habitat degradation. Gorillas and chimpanzees are found at higher densities where forest is intact, wildlife laws are enforced, human influence is low, and disease impacts have been low. Strategic use of the results of these analyses could conserve the majority of gorillas and chimpanzees. With around 80% of both subspecies occurring outside protected areas, their conservation requires reinforcement of anti-poaching efforts both inside and outside protected areas (particularly where habitat quality is high and human impact is low), diligent disease control measures (including training, advocacy, and research into Ebola virus disease), and the preservation of high-quality habitat through integrated land-use planning and implementation of best practices by the extractive and agricultural industries."

1341,3863,"The distribution and abundance of the Indo-Pacific crocodile Crocodylus porosus Schneider in the Klias River, Sabah, east Malaysia","Twelve spotlight surveys for the Indo-Pacific crocodile Crocodylus porosus were carried out from June 1987 to July 1988 along an approximately 37-km stretch of the Klias River, Sabah, Malaysia. Crocodiles sighted were divided into three size classes: Class 1 (hatchlings and juveniles <1 m in length; Class 2 (subadults and young adults 1-3 m in length; and Class 3 ('eyes only', usually adults >3 m in length). Salinity and temperature readings were taken for each sighting and each location was mapped. A total of 182 crocodiles were sighted with densities in the range 1.1-3.6 km-1. Class 1 individuals were most frequently encountered (63.2%) followed by Class 3 (24.2%) and Class 2 (12.6%). Crocodiles were most abundant in the upper mangrove section of the river, while the distributions of Class 1 and Class 2 individuals differed significantly (t-test for non-paired samples, p≤0.05) with regard to location along the river. There were no significant differences in habitat salinity between classes although there were in water temperature (t-test for non-paired samples, p≤0.05) between Classes 1 and 3, with smaller crocodiles more frequently sighted at temperatures from 30-31°C. The population densities are higher than reported in 1984, but the structure reflects a population under pressure from hunting. "
1342,2458,"Recovery of alpine ibex from near extinction: the result of effective protection, captive breeding, and reintroductions","Beginning in the 1500s, over-exploitation and poaching led to a steady decline of ibex (Capra ibex ibex) numbers in the European Alps. The use of ibex products in many folk remedies guaranteed high financial returns for the hunter and resulted in the relentless pursuit of this species. By the early 1800s, <100 animals survived in a single population in the Italian Gran Paradiso mountain massif. The recovery to more than 20 000 animals today is the result of a four-stage conservation effort which returned alpine ibex to almost their entire original range of distribution: (1) effective protection of the last remaining population, (2) captive breeding of animals caught in the recovered last population, (3) reintroduction of captive-bred animals into protected original habitat, (4) translocation of animals from successfully established ""reservoir"" populations to uninhabited sites. Alpine ibex management faces two challenges today: (1) habitat destruction in areas of high population densities, and (2) low genetic variability possibly a result of inbreeding during a succession of four potential population bottleneck situations.

1343,1380,"Population Dynamics of Wild Chimpanzees at Bossou, Guinea, Between 1976 and 1983","The population dynamics of a small group of wild chimpanzees at Bossou, Guinea, were studied during a 6.5-year period between 1976 and 1983. The natality rate (0.23 births/female/year) was higher and the interbirth interval (4.3-4.4 years/female) was shorter than those of chimpanzees at East African study sites (the Gombe and Mahale National Parks). The infant mortality for the first 3 years (0.06-0.18/year) was lower than those in East Africa. However, the population had remained almost stable since 1967 (growth rate: 0.985/year). The increase in number by births was offset by the disappearance (perhaps emigration) of adolescent chimpanzees. Adult males immigrated and disappeared (perhaps emigrated) but adult females rarely did. "

Of 11 taxa documented in the 1970s, 10 were observed in the 1990s; only Tantilla planiceps, a rare form in the 1970s, was absent in the 1990s. Nine of the 11 taxa were similar in abundance across sampling periods. Juvenile Pituophis catenifer and Crotalus viridis increased dramatically in the 1990s; adult Pituophis catenifer declined, whereas adult Crotalus viridis increased. Analysis of these two taxa indicated that abundance along the transect was approximately similar in the 1970s and 1990s; snakes were most abundant in the ecotone. Snake abundance was similar for the 1970s and 1990s in spite of increased road traffic, continued off-road vehicle use and sheep and cattle grazing, and collecting for the pet-trade. Additional study will be necessary to assess the apparent stability of this snake community."
1345,3063,Common Chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater) in an urban preserve: persistence of a small population and estimation of longevity,"Field studies of amphibians and reptiles rarely span more than two or three years necessitating that inferences concerning population biology of many forms are derived from brief snap-shots of their life history. In 2011 we resurveyed one small population of the Common Chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater) in the Lookout Mountain Preserve in the Phoenix Metropolitan region studied intensively during the 1990s. Extending prior work with this low density population, we assessed current population size by direct count and in relation to variation in abundance in previous years. Recaptures separated by 1216 years confirmed prior short-term studies indicating that S. ater exhibit growth rates of 12 mm per year as adults. Moreover, two females, initially captured in 1995, still resided within 20 m of their original capture sites in 2011. Overall, this urbanized population of Sauromalus ater persists in spite of its small size, increases in recreational activity, trail establishment, and heat island effects associated with the Phoenix Metropolitan; region."
1346,3375,Silvicultural use of herbicide in sub-boreal spruce forest: implications for small mammal population dynamics,"Vegetation management in northern coniferous forest ecosystems may have implications for small mammal communities. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that herbicide-induced habitat alteration would reduce small mammal populations in early-successional stages of sub-boreal spruce forest. A secondary objective was to determine the long-term influence of herbicide treatment on reproduction, survival, and growth attributes of deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) populations. Small mammal populations were intensively sampled in 4 pairs of control and treatment sites dominated by early-successional vegetation (5-10 yr after clearcut harvesting) near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Sampling was conducted during 1987 (pretreatment year), 1988-89 (first and second posttreatment years), and in 1991-92 (fourth and fifth posttreatment years). Higher mean numbers of red-backed voles (P = 0.03) and shrews (Sorex spp.; P = 0.001) were present on control than treatment sites during 198892. Mean abundance of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus; P = 0.69) and deer mice (P = 0.20) were similar on control and treatment sites throughout the study. Short-tailed weasels (Mustela erminea) and longtailed weasels (Mustela frenata) were commonly captured on both control and treatment sites. There were no consistent differences between control and treatment populations in body mass, total biomass, or proportion of adult male and female red-backed voles and deer mice in breeding condition. However, there was a higher mean number of successful pregnancies in control than treatment populations of red-backed voles (P = 0.02) but not deer mice (P = 0.18) during posttreatment years. Mean Jolly-Seber estimates of survival of red-backed voles (P = 0.01) but not deer mice (P = 0.70) were higher in treatment than control populations. The magnitude of observed demographic effects from herbicide treatment were well within the mean values of natural fluctuations of these variables. Herbicide treatment of areas dominated by early-successional vegetation in northern coniferous forests should be staggered in time and space to allow recovery (2-3 yr) of vegetation and small mammal species such as red-backed voles and shrews."
1347,3304,"Dynamics of peripheral populations of Great Basin pocket mice, Perognathus parvus, and Western harvest mice, Reithrodontomys megalotis, in southern British Columbia","The Great Basin Pocket Mouse (Perognathus parvus) and Western Harvest Mouse (Reithrodontomys megalotis) are two peripheral species occurring in the southern Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada. Both species are listed as vulnerable to extirpation because of habitat loss, primarily due to conversion of natural habitat to agricultural uses and suburban expansion. Population dynamics of these two species were studied in three habitat types: old field, sagebrush, and pine forest. The Great Basin Pocket Mouse occurred at densities ranging from 12 to 28/ha in sagebrush habitats and at 2-8/ha in old fields and Ponderosa Pine forest. The Western Harvest Mouse occurred at variable densities up to 10/ha in old fields and up to 5/ha in sagebrush habitats. Mean number of lactating females for Great Basin Pocket Mice ranged from 4-8 in sagebrush, 1-5 in old fields and pine forests combined. Mean juvenile survival to adulthood ranged from 3.28 young Great Basin Pocket Mice per pregnant female in sagebrush, 4.67 in old field, and 1.82 in pine forest habitats. Mean juvenile survival to adulthood of Western Harvest Mice ranged from 1.46-1.72 young per female in old field and sagebrush habitats. Conservation of habitat features (high biomass and structural diversity of grasses and forbs) in linear habitats has the potential to maintain populations of Western Harvest Mice. The Great Basin Pocket Mouse needs features of sagebrush and old field habitats that need to be conserved as natural non-linear components in mosaics of natural and anthropogenic habitats. Both species could act as ""indicators"" of habitat integrity for a wide range of other vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant species in the Okanagan Valley."
1348,3314,"Small mammals and stand structure in young pine, seed-tree, and old-growth forest, southwest Canada","Alternative silvicultural systems to clearcutting are receiving considerable attention in Pacific Northwest forests of North America. Understanding the implications of these harvesting systems on stand structure and biodiversity through time is a fundamental aspect of forest ecosystem management. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that diversity of stand-structure attributes and forest floor small-mammal communities will increase from young pine to seed tree to old-growth forest. The study area was within mixed Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)-lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests within the Montane Spruce biogeoclimatic zone near Summerland in south-central British Columbia, Canada. This retrospective study had three replicate stands each of 17-yr-old""young pine"" (clear-cut harvested), ""seed tree"" composed of young pine with Douglas-fir seed trees, and uncut ""old-growth"" composed primarily of Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine. Stand-structure attributes (coniferous tree layers and understory vegetation) were measured in each stand. Small-mammal populations were sampled intensively from 1995 to 1997 in all stands. The mean total percentage cover and crown-volume index of herbs and mosses were similar among treatment stands, but for shrubs-deciduous trees were highest in young pine and lowest in old growth. Mean species richness of herbs and coniferous trees was similar among treatment stands, but for shrubs-deciduous trees was highest in the young pine. Mean species diversity of herbs and shrubs-deciduous trees was similar among treatment stands, but for coniferous trees was higher in the seed-tree and old-growth stands than in the young pine stands. Mean richness of layers of herbs and shrubs-deciduous trees appeared consistently highest in the young pine, but for coniferous trees was highest in the seed-tree stands. Mean abundance of red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi) was consistently higher in the old-growth than in young pine or seed-tree stands. Mean numbers of Northwestern chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), heather voles (Phenacomys intermedius), western jumping mice (Zapus princeps), montane shrews (Sorex monticolus), and common shrews (S. cinereus) were higher in the seed-tree or young pine stands than in old growth. Mean abundance of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) was highest in seed-tree stands. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), long-tailed voles (M. longicaudus), and short-tailed weasels (Mustela erminea) had similar mean numbers among treatment stands. Mean species richness and diversity of small mammals was higher in the seed-tree and young pine stands than in old growth. Each of these stand types offers its own structural diversity to the forest landscape and should help manage for a range of biodiversity goals."
1349,3209,Influence of repeated fertilization and cattle grazing on forest ecosystems: Abundance and diversity of forest-floor small mammals,"Intensive silvicultural practices such as pre-commercial thinning (PCT) and repeated fertilization have the potential to provide a diversity of forest habitats and wildlife to meet biodiversity conservation goals while maintaining wood production. Silvopasture combines livestock with trees in some managed forests, but the impact of grazing on biodiversity is unclear. Forest-floor small mammal communities may serve as ecological indicators of changes in forest structure and function, and hence biodiversity. This study was designed to test the hypotheses (H) that in young (13-23years) even-aged lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands, (i) abundance of understory herbaceous vegetation and (ii) abundance and diversity of forest-floor small mammals would be: (H 1) enhanced in fertilized stands, and (H 2) reduced in stands with cattle grazing. Study areas were located near Kelowna (lightly grazed) and Summerland (heavily grazed) in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had four pairs of PCT stands thinned to a range of densities with one stand of each pair fertilized four times at 2-year intervals. Herbaceous vegetation and forest-floor small mammal communities were sampled from 1993 to 2002.Mean abundance of total herbs, total grasses, and fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) all increased dramatically with fertilization in the lightly grazed stands, and hence part (i) of H 1 seemed to be supported. Mean total abundance of small mammals was higher in fertilized than unfertilized stands in two years but not overall. Species richness and diversity of small mammals were similar between unfertilized and fertilized stands, and hence part (ii) of H 1 was partially supported for abundance, but not for richness or diversity. Lightly grazed fertilized stands had low abundance of Peromyscus maniculatus and Tamias amoenus, but high abundance of Microtus pennsylvanicus, Sorex monticolus, and Sorex cinereus. Phenacomys intermedius and Myodes gapperi also seemed to decline in fertilized stands. Mustela erminea, a principal predator of microtines, was captured more frequently in the lightly grazed fertilized than unfertilized stands.Cattle grazing reduced the abundance of herbaceous vegetation, at least in the fertilized stands at Summerland where they consumed a significant proportion of the biomass, and hence part (i) of H 2 was supported. However, this premise did not hold for the unfertilized stands where grazing had little effect on the three plant groups. Part (ii) of H 2 was not supported as cattle grazing did not reduce total abundance and species diversity of forest-floor small mammals. Grazing in fertilized stands did limit population fluctuations and dynamics of M. pennsylvanicus and abundance of the two insectivores during certain years. Forest-floor small mammal communities and their myriad ecological functions should be maintained, at least in some years, in those stands intensively managed for wood, biomass, and livestock production. "
1350,3310,Stand structure and the abundance and diversity of plants and small mammals in natural and intensively managed forests,"Little attention has been given to investigating biodiversity in managed forests. Pre-commercial thinning (PCT) and fertilization have been used successfully to increase growth of coniferous trees, vegetative succession, and overall stand structure in second-growth stands. This study was designed to test the hypotheses (H) that PCT and repeated fertilization of young (20-25 years) even-aged lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands would enhance (H1) coniferous stand structure; (H2) abundance and diversity of understory vegetation; and (H3) abundance and diversity of forest-floor small mammals, to levels found in mature and old-growth forests. Replicate study areas were located near Summerland and Kelowna in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had six stands: young plantation, thinned stand (1000 stems/ha), thinned-fertilized stand (1000 stems/ha), unthinned stand, mature forest, and old-growth forest. Coniferous stand structure, understory vegetation, and forest-floor small mammals were sampled during a 5-year period from 1999 through 2003. The smaller tree sizes (diameter, height, basal area) in the young lodgepole pine stands did not support the tree size part of H1. Similar abundance of overstory and total conifers did support the abundance part of H1. The diversity component was supported by the similarity in species and structural diversity of total conifers among the intensively managed and older unmanaged stands. Response of understory vegetation was dominated by the abundance of herbs in the thinned-fertilized stands. There was no difference in shrub abundance among stands, but mosses and terrestrial lichens were most numerous in the mature and old-growth stands. Our results supported the abundance part of H2, at least for herbs and shrubs. Species richness and diversity of vascular plants were similar in managed and old-growth forests, and richness was lowest in the mature stands. H3 was supported for total abundance, species richness, and diversity of small mammals, and for the generalist species Peromyscus maniculatus and Tamias amoenus, but not for the old forest specialist Myodes gapperi. Two insectivores, Sorex monticolus and Sorex cinereus, were at comparable or higher abundance in the managed stands than in the older unmanaged forests. Three other microtines: Microtus pennsylvanicus, Microtus longicaudus, and Phenacomys intermedius were early successional vegetation specialists, and hence did not fit the prediction of H3. Thus, despite overall quantitative differences in stand structure and species-specific variability between our intensively managed and older natural stands, old-growth attributes seem to be developing in a time-span of decades rather than the centuries depicted by long rotations. "
1351,3262,Long-term responses in population dynamics and diversity of small mammals in riparian and upland habitats within an agricultural landscape,"Riparian zones in agricultural landscapes provide linear non-crop habitats for a variety of plant and mammal species, and hence are an important component of biodiversity. To date, variable responses of abundance, species richness, and species diversity of small mammals have been recorded in riparian and upland habitats. To address this variability, we provide a detailed analysis of seasonal changes in abundance and diversity of terrestrial small-mammal communities over a 7-year period within an agricultural landscape in south-central British Columbia, Canada. We tested the hypotheses (H) that abundance, species richness, and species diversity of communities of small mammals (H1), and demographic parameters of reproduction, recruitment, and survival of the major species: deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and montane vole (Microtus montanus) (H2), would be higher in riparian than upland habitats. Mean total abundance of small mammals was higher in summer and winter, and species richness higher in summer, in riparian than hedgerow habitats. Winter population data supported the total and species abundance patterns for small mammals, but species richness was similar, and diversity lower, in riparian than hedgerow sites during winter periods. Deer mice were the dominant species in terms of abundance and reproductive output for pregnancies and recruitment, but not survival, in riparian sites. Montane voles were similar in abundance and demographic parameters in the two habitats. House mice (Mus musculus) preferred hedgerows and wandering shrews (Sorex vagrans) riparian sites. Demographic parameters for deer mice and montane voles indicated that both riparian and hedgerow sites were ""source"" rather than ""sink"" habitats, and likely contribute to maintenance of mammal diversity in agricultural landscapes. "
1352,3386,Response of Red squirrels and feeding damage to variable stand density in young lodgepole pine forest,"This study was designed to test the hypothesis that large-scale habitat alteration by stand thinning would reduce red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) populations and feeding damage in young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest. An additional objective included integration of stand protection with an optimum thinning regime for growth rates of crop trees. Study areas were located neat Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of ≈ 500 (low), 1000 (medium), and 2000 (high) stems/ha, with an unthinned, juvenile pine stand and old-growth pine stand for comparison. Squirrel populations were sampled intensively in the thinned stands from 1989 to 1991; feeding damage was assessed annually from 1989 to 1993. Five-year diameter and height increments of crop trees were measured in the thinned stands at Penticton and Prince George, and 4-yr increments in these stands at Kamloops. Red squirrel populations were significantly reduced in the low-density stand compared with either the medium- or high-density stands at Penticton and Prince George, Squirrels were less abundant in both the low- and medium-density stands at Kamloops. Squirrel populations in the unthinned and old-growth stands were similar or lower in abundance than those in the thinned stands. There were significantly higher numbers of red squirrel first captures in the medium- and high-density stands than in the low-density stand. There were no consistent significant differences between stands in proportion of squirrels breeding, recruitment, mean survival over summer and winter period, or mean body mass. More trees per hectare were damaged in the high than in either low- or medium-density stands at all study areas. Mean diameter increments of trees in the low-density stands were significantly higher than those in the medium- and high-density stands at all study areas. Trees grew significantly faster in height in the high- than in the low-density stands at Penticton and Prince George; the converse was true at Kamloops. Manipulation of stand density on an operational basis in young lodgepole pine has clearly indicated that both stand protection from squirrel feeding damage and productivity of crop trees are enhanced by reducing the number of stems per hectare. This result has been achived in replicated study areas covering three different forest ecological zones."
1353,3081,"The decline of Purple Sandpipers Calidris maritima in the Moray Firth, Scotland - an effect of recruitment","Numbers of Purple Sandpipers at roosts in the Moray Firth, NE Scotland, declined by 55% between winters; 1986/871990/91 and 1996/972000/01. To investigate the decline, changes in recruitment (percentage of firstyear; birds) were examined at three major roosts that showed a slightly greater decline than the total population.; The percentage of first-year birds varied between roosts and years, declining during the late 1980s and early; 1990s, but increasing later. The percentages were also low compared to other studies. A model incorporating; a varying percentage of first-year birds and constant mortality provided an explanation for the decline. Therefore,; it is possible that the decline in numbers was due to poorer recruitment. The Moray Firth population is; derived from at least two breeding populations, but we could not tell if one or both breeding populations were; affected by the poor recruitment."
1354,1007,The Growth of the Population of Dark Bellied Brent Geese Branta b. bernicla Between 1955 and 1988.,"There was no evidence of density-dependent factors operating in the world population of dark-bellied brent geese between 1955-1988. The growth of the world population over this period can be explained by an annual survival rate of 85.7% (for birds >6 months old), under-counting in years of good breeding, and a pattern of breeding success which has been good (median of 0.76 first-year birds per breeding adult) once or twice in every 3 yr. -Authors"
1355,3094,"Local and global influences on population declines of coastal waders: Purple Sandpiper Calidris maritima numbers in the Moray Firth, Scotland","Declines in numbers by several wader species in Britain have been linked to climate change, but the; mechanism for the declines has rarely been explored. Britain lies at the northern end of the East Atlantic; Flyway, and supports 1.3 million out of the Flyways 8.5 million coastal waders (Charadrii) in winter and; the Purple Sandpiper is one of the species whose numbers have declined. Here, we examine; the dynamics of the decline as observed in the Moray Firth, northeast Scotland, investigating whether; the decline was due to poorer apparent survival (return rate) or poorer recruitment of young birds. The; maximum number in the Moray Firth declined from 860 in 1987/88 to 236 in 2006/07, with some; increase during winters 2007/08 and 2008/09. At the three main high-tide roosts (Balintore, Lossiemouth; and Buckie) the maximum combined number declined from 574 to 90. Changes in survival and; recruitment (percentage of first-year birds) were examined at these roosts from captured samples, which; were ringed and recaptured. There were no significant changes between winters in survival rates, nor; were there differences between the survival rates of age groups (first-year and adult) or bill size groups,; which represented birds of different sex and breeding origin. Annual survival estimates for the three; roosts ranged from 72 to 77%. The percentage of first-year birds varied among roosts and years; the; lowest values were during the late 1980s/early 1990s and early 2000s. A free-running population model; incorporating varying percentages of first-year birds and constant mortality for each roost provided; a plausible explanation for the decline. Although modelled numbers followed the observed pattern,; a discrepancy in one year was carried forward in subsequent years, so that the fit with the observed; numbers was parallel rather than similar. However, it seems that the decline in numbers was largely due; to poorer recruitment. We discuss whether breeding success had declined, whether the population had; responded to changes in the local sewage treatment systems, which could affect invertebrate food for; Purple Sandpipers, or whether fewer birds chose to winter in Scotland. The Moray Firth population is; derived from Norway and possibly Canada, and there is evidence that the Norwegian population was; disproportionately affected. The reason for poor recruitment requires further study, and other wader; species require examination to test if poor recruitment is a common feature of decline in numbers."
1356,2623,"Populations, migrations, biometrics and moult of the turnstone Arenaria i. interpres on the east Atlantic coastline, with special reference to the Siberian population","Three populations of Turnstone were studied. Primarily a series of comparisons were made between the Canadian-Greenland population which winters mainly in western Europe ad the Siberian population which winters partly in southern Africa. There was no long term change in the size of the latter population over the period 1976 to 1989. There is evidence for site fidelity to winter quarters in South Africa. Spring migration takes place through the Mediterranean and autumn migration through the Black and Caspian Seas. There are only small differences in size between the three populations of Turnstones, but marked differences occurred in patterns of change in mass. The Siberian population has no mid-winter fattening in contrast to the Canadian-Greenland population. The annual food consumption by the Siberian birds was slightly less than the Canadian-Greenland birds. The duration of primary moult of 1Y+ Siberian birds was about 45 days longer than that of Canadian-Greenland birds; it started two months later and was less synchronized. Of first-year Siberian birds 32% of the population undergo partial wing moult whereas no first-year Canadian-Greenland birds moult."
1357,2995,"Frigatebirds on Aldabra Atoll: population census, recommended monitoring protocol and sustainable tourism guidelines","We report the results of a survey of breeding Greater Frigatebird Fregata minor and Lesser Frigatebird F. ariel on Aldabra Atoll, a UNESCO World Heritage site in the Seychelles archipelago, which hosts the largest breeding population of frigatebirds in the Indian Ocean. All four colonies across the atoll were surveyed in 2011 and 2012 by counting adults on nests and chicks, and calculating the number of fledged birds. The breeding population in 2011 consisted of approximately 4,400 pairs of Greater Frigatebird and 6,600 pairs of Lesser Frigatebird. This is a potential increase of at least 10% since the last comparable surveys in 1976/77 and 2000. However, 2012 populations were considerably less than in 2011, highlighting significant annual variation and the need for more data. We also report a new breeding colony on the island of Picard, which was last reported to host breeding frigatebirds a century ago. We outline recommendations for future frigatebird monitoring on Aldabra and elsewhere and revisions to tourist regulations resulting from the census. "

1361,2168,Vital population statistics of the exploited eel stock on the Swedish west coast,"The population dynamics and exploitation of the yellow eel (Anguilla anguilla (L.)) stock on the Swedish west coast were studied. In contrast to a generally observed reduction in the recruitment of glass eels in Europe, including in Swedish waters, there was no indication of a decline in the total eel fishery yields along the Swedish west coast. Long-term records of daily catches as well as by test fishing results also shown that this stability in eel fishery yields has not been maintained by an increase in fishery effort, as the catch-per-unit-efforts in the past 20 years have been more or less unchanged. These findings implied that the number of recruits to the fishery has been rather stable, possibly indicating that density-dependent factors at the elver and yellow eel stages may moderate variations in glass eel recruitment. Total instantaneous rate of mortality was estimated from records on eel length distribution in the professional fyke-net fishery. The estimated total mortality rate in an isolated archipelago population on the west coast was chosen as an approximation of the instantaneous rate of natural mortality and net emigration in the west coast eel stock. The differences between these two estimates could, thus be regarded as the mortality that occurred due to fishing. It was found that the eel fishery was very intense and most fish were caught in small sizes, resulting in a low escapement rate of maturing fish."
1362,3698,Spatial distribution of fishes in a Northwest Atlantic ecosystem in relation to risk of predation by a marine mammal,"1. Numerous studies have shown that, at spatial scales of metres to several kilometres, animals; balance the trade-off between foraging success and predation mortality by increasing; their use of safer but less profitable habitats as predation risk increases. However, it is less; clear whether prey respond similarly at the larger spatiotemporal scales of many ecosystems.; 2. We determine whether this behaviour is evident in a large marine ecosystem, the southern; Gulf of St. Lawrence (sGSL, 75 000 km2) over a 42-year period. This ecosystem is characterized; by a recent increase in the abundance of a large marine predator, the grey seal (Halichoerus; grypus Fabricius), by more than an order of magnitude.; 3. We compared changes in spatial distribution over the 19712012 period between important; prey of grey seals (Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L.; white hake, Urophycis tenuis Mitchill; and; thorny skate, Amblyraja radiata Donovan) and non-prey fishes. Distribution was modelled; using generalized additive models incorporating spatially variable effects of predation risk,; density dependence and water temperature.; 4. Distributions of cod, hake and skate were strongly related to risk of predation by seals,; with distribution shifting into lower risk areas as predation risk increased. Non-prey species; did not show similar changes in habitat use. Spatial variation in fish condition suggests that; these low-risk areas are also less profitable for cod and skate in terms of food availability.; The effects of density dependence and water temperature were also important in models, but; did not account for the changes in habitat use as the risk of predation increased.; 5. These results indicate that these fish are able to assess and respond to spatial variation in; predation risk at very large spatial scales. They also suggest that non-consumptive risk; effects may be an important component of the declines in productivity of seal prey in this; ecosystem, and of the indirect effects at lower trophic levels."
1363,4109,"Reproduction, abundance, and population growth for a fisher (Pekania pennanti) population in the Sierra National Forest, California","In the west coast region of the United States, fishers (Pekania pennanti) exist in 2 remnant populations1 in northern California and 1 in the southern Sierra Nevada, Californiaand 3 reintroduced populations (western Washington, southern Oregon, and northeastern California). The West Coast Distinct Population Segment of fishers encompassing all of these populations was proposed for listing as threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in October 2014. There are likely fewer than 500 total fishers in the southern Sierra Nevada population isolate, but empirical data on demographic rates, population size, and population growth are almost entirely lacking. Our goal was to estimate demographic parameters and current abundance of a fisher population at the north margin of the southern Sierra Nevada region. Radiocollared fishers were monitored from 2007 to 2013 to estimate survival and demographic rates, and camera traps were used to estimate population size based on detections of individual animals in a capture markresight (CMR) framework. A Leslie matrix model was used to estimate a deterministic population growth rate (?). Fisher abundance ranged from 48 animals in 2010 to 62 animals in 2012, whereas mean population density varied from 0.075 to 0.096 fishers/km2. Reproductive status was determined for 89 of 93 total denning opportunities; denning and weaning rates were estimated at 84% and 70%, and litter size was 1.6 kits. We documented 8 den failures, mostly associated with predator attacks. Demographic rates in the study population were comparable to reports from elsewhere in California or Oregon, but the CMR-based population density was the lowest reported in the United States. The estimated ? for the population was 0.966 (range 0.7861.155), which was in agreement with no indication of a positive or negative trend in population density. An encouraging result from sensitivity analyses was that minor improvements in fisher survival and fecundity, facilitated by proposed mitigation or management to reduce exposure to several agents of mortality, could improve ? to 1.061.09 over the longer term. We believe that the combination of a population growth rate slightly below 1.0, small population size and low density, multiple challenges to survival and reproduction, and damage to habitat from wildfires warrants concern for the viability of the fisher population in our study area, which may extend to the overall southern Sierra Nevada population if ? trends below 1.0 in other parts of the region. There is a need for continued monitoring and potential mitigation for threats to survival to assure continued presence of fishers in the southern Sierra Nevada, California."
1364,676,Decrease of Sage Grouse Centrocerus-Urophasianus after Plowing of Sagebrush Steppe,"The effects on wildlife of ploughing sagebrush Artemisia spp. steppe have been little studied. From 1973 to 1984, numbers of lekking male sage grouse Centrocerus urophasianus declined by 73% in a study area of south central Montana, 16% of which was ploughed by 1984. The proportion of ploughed wintering areas increased from 10% in 1975 to 30% in 1984. In contrast, numbers of lekking male sage grouse on a nearby unploughed control area showed no clear long-term trend. Ploughing even small areas of sagebrush steppe to produce cereal grains appears more detrimental to sage grouse than chemical control of sagebrush. "
1365,156,The status and conservation of the Chacoan peccary in Paraguay.,"The Chacoan peccary Catagonus wagneri is endemic to the dry thorn forest of the Gran Chaco of Paraguay, Argentina and Bolivia. Since its discovery by scientists in the 1970s its population has declined due to overhunting, habitat destruction, and possibly disease. As of 1989 about 5000 individuals are estimated to survive in the Paraguayan Chaco. Small dispersed populations still exist in Argentina and Bolivia, but more information is needed on the status of this species in those two countries. In Paraguay, Chacoan peccaries have almost disappeared from the two national parks within their range and the only significant population exists in an area where there are no reserves. The survival of this species depends on enforcing regulations against hunting both within and outside the national parks, translocating animals to the parks, establishing a system of reserves on private land in critical areas, training of Paraguayan wildlife professionals, and environmental education.

1366,2976,"Long-term decline of the western Pacific leatherback, Dermochelys coriacea: a globally important sea turtle population.","The leatherbacks nesting at Bird's Head Peninsula, Papua Barat, Indonesia, account for 75% of the total leatherback nesting in the western Pacific and represent the last sizeable nesting population in the entire Pacific. Sporadic nest counts at Jamursba Medi Beach at Bird's Head have indicated a declining trend from the 1980s through 2004, although a relatively high amount of nesting has recently been documented at Wermon Beach, located 30 km east of Jamursba Medi. We used expanded year-round nesting surveys from 2005 to 2011 at these two primary nesting beaches to obtain more robust estimates of the nesting population size and to evaluate long-term nesting trends. We found a 29% decline in nesting at Jamursba Medi and a 52% decline at Wermon from 2005 through 2011. We found that the estimated annual number of nests at Jamursba Medi has declined 78.3% over the past 27 years (5.5% annual rate of decline) from 14,522 in 1984 to 1,596 in 2011. Nesting at Wermon has been monitored since 2002 and has declined 2.8% (11.6% annual rate of decline) from 2,994 nests in 2002 to 1,096 in 2011. Collectively, our findings indicate a continual and significant long term nesting decline of 5.9% per year at these primary western Pacific beaches since 1984. Mark-recapture with PIT tags, initiated in 2003, resulted in the tagging of 1,371 individual nesting females as of March 2012. Observed clutch frequencies ranged from 3-10 per season with a mean of 5.5 ± 1.6 and, based on nest counts, provide an estimate of approximately 489 females nesting in 2011. The persistent and long term decline we report for the Bird's Head leatherback population follows other dramatic declines and extinctions of leatherback populations throughout the Pacific over the last 30 years. These findings highlight the urgent need for continued and enhanced conservation and management efforts to prevent the collapse of what might be the last remaining stronghold for leatherbacks in the Pacific.

1367,1502,The last populations of the Critically Endangered onager Equus hemionus onager in Iran: urgent requirements for protection and study,"The onager Equus hemionus onager, a wild ass endemic to Iran, is categorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Its biology and conservation requirements are poorly documented. We report our observations, made in 1997 and 2000, on the behaviour and ecology of the two remaining populations, located in the Touran Protected Area and the Bahram-e-Goor Reserve. Recent population counts by the Department of Environment of Iran (471 in the Protected Area and 96 in the Reserve) are markedly lower than the estimate of 600-770 made in the 1970s in the Touran Protected Area. We observed social interactions between stallions and mares outside the breeding season that contrasts with the known social structure of this subspecies. Poaching, competition with domestic animals, removal of shrubs for domestic use, and land conversion have been identified as the main threats to the two remaining onager populations. In addition, geographical isolation could cause the loss of genetic variability in these two relatively small populations, and also makes them more susceptible to the potential effects of stochastic events such as drought or disease. Public awareness, appropriate protection, and scientific studies must be urgently supported by both national and international organizations in order to prevent the extinction of these two apparently dwindling populations of onager.

1368,4173,"Species diversity, relative abundance and length structure of oceanic sharks caught by the Venezuelan longline fishery in the Caribbean Sea and western-central Atlantic","This study examines the species diversity, relative abundance, and length structure of oceanic sharks caught by the Venezuelan longline fishery targeting swordfish and tuna. Shark catch data was collected by scientific observers during the period 1994 to 2003. The total shark catch was comprised of 25 species, in which the most frequently caught were Prionace glauca (34.8%) and Carcharhinus signatus (20.2%). Other common species in the catch composition were C. falciformis (8.5%), Sphyrna mokarran (6.8%), and Isuru oxyrinchus (6.2%). The inter-annual variation of the Shannon-Wiener index was characterized by an apparent loss of the shark diversity throughout the time series. Kriging map showed that areas with relative high diversity values were located in the southeastern Caribbean Sea, primarily in areas close to the islands and coast of Venezuela. Other areas with significant diversity values corresponded to the inner arc of the Lesser Antilles and the Suriname shelf. The analysis of catch per unit effort trends for the five most common species revealed that all series had a negative slopes, but only one (C. falciformis) was statistically significant. Shark catches for the most important species comprised a large proportion of juveniles. Major efforts will be needed to generate steady scientific information required for stock assessment. "
1369,4172,"Population structure, distribution and relative abundance of the blue shark (Prionace glauca) in the Caribbean Sea and adjacent waters of the North Atlantic","Catch and fishing effort data from the Venezuelan Pelagic Longline Observer Program (VPLOP) in the Caribbean Sea and adjacent waters of the Atlantic were used to investigate the population structure, distribution and relative abundance of the blue shark, . Prionace glauca. A total of 959 blue sharks were sampled by trained observers during the period of January 1994 to December 2007. Fork length (FL) in males ranged from 79 to 355. cm and from 97 to 349. cm in females. Sexual segregation at the spatial and temporal scale was observed, males dominated January-June and during October-December across all areas; while females dominated during July-September with a higher magnitude in the Atlantic side (Guyana-Amazon area). Sex ratio for mature (>180. cm FL) blue shark favored females in the Caribbean Sea from July to December, and in the Guyana-Amazon area in July-September; while immature blue sharks were dominated by males across all areas. Thirty-four pregnant females were caught in the Caribbean Sea and three in the Guyana-Amazon area. Pregnant females displayed a seasonal trend which increased from September through January, where >50% of the pregnant females occurred during November-January; of the pregnant females caught in the Caribbean Sea two had embryos close to the size-at-birth [>35. cm total length (TL)]. The spatial distribution of blue sharks in the Caribbean Sea was marked by high concentrations around the offshore islands of Venezuela and the Netherland Antilles year round; while in the Guyana-Amazon area the high concentrations were more seasonally localized off northeastern coast of South America but diminished progressively and by the end of the year was absent in the area. Relative abundance of blue shark was estimated from the Venezuelan pelagic longline (VPL) fleet using a General Linear Model Approach with a delta lognormal model distribution to account for the high proportion of zero observations. The variability within vessel groups was partitioned into each vessel variance and the auto-correlation within a vessel was evaluated by using a variance-covariance matrix model. Diagnostic checks and deviance table analysis were performed to identify the set of model factors and interactions that adequately explained the observed variability. The results indicated that variability of catch rates within vessels is as large as the variability among vessel groups, where smaller and medium size vessels show higher catch rates of blue sharks in the VPL fleet. Standardized catch rates indicated in general a lower relative abundance in the most recent years followed by a slight recovery that requires caution due to the predicted high variance. Fishing activities can have uneven effects in the blue shark population due to its spatial and temporal segregation in the study area; potential changes in the fishing operations of the VPL fleet can have negative effects in the population structure of blue sharks in the Caribbean Sea and adjacent waters if habitat for blue sharks are increasingly used to target other valuable species (e.g., large tunas and swordfish).

1370,4030,Effect of drought on demography of Pileated Finch (Coryphospingus pileatus: Thraupidae) in northeastern Brazil,"Information on the effects of stochastic weather events on the survival of tropical birds can improve the knowledge of life history adaptations, allowing better demographic projection models to examine species persistence in light of global climate change forecasts. With this in mind, we conducted a mark-recapture study on Coryphospingus pileatus in the Brazilian Caatinga. We applied Cormack-Jolly-Seber and Robust Design models to test the influence of sex, precipitation, drought and vegetation on demographic parameters. We found that the apparent annual survival of residents ranged from 31 to 49% in the first year and 65–77% in the second, depending on the area, sex and structure of the models used. Controlling for an effect of time since marking, survival was substantially lower in a year affected by a severe drought, and was higher at a site with more open vegetation structure. The results showed little variation in survival of the species during the regular annual dry season and a decline greater than 50% in apparent survival caused by severe drought. This suggest that in prolonged drought the drastic reduction of food directly affects the productivity, reducing in survival observed over time and projecting a critical perspective for endangered species that may disappear due to climate change."
1371,2543,"Seasonal occurrence, distribution and movements of the whale shark, Rhincodon typus, at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia","Aerial surveys between 1989 and 1992 demonstrated that large numbers of whale sharks appear on Ningaloo Reef in north-western Australia during autumn, shortly after the coral has undergone mass spawning. This movement into the reef waters would allow whale sharks to capitalize on the increased production of zooplankton brought about as a result of this mass spawning of corals and other marine organisms. Sharks occupied mainly the relatively turbid waters on the reef front, where a northerly current prevailed, rather than the offshore, warmer waters of the southerly flowing Leeuwin Current. The sharks moved in to the reef front from offshore but, once inshore, the majority swam parallel to the reef. The maximum density in any sector of the reef at any one time was four sharks per km, recorded in May 1992. The longer the time since sharks first appeared on the reef, the greater was their tendency to aggregate in a particular region of the reef. Evidence is presented that indicates that whale shark numbers at the northern end of Ningaloo Reef declined during the latter half of the 1980s; this decline may be related to the massive destruction of coral by the gastropod mollusc Drupella cornus during this period."
1372,3361,Mark-recapture and stochastic population models for Polar bears of the High Arctic,"We used mark-recapture data and population viability analysis (PVA) to estimate demographic parameters, abundance, and harvest risks for two adjacent populations of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) inhabiting Lancaster Sound and Norwegian Bay, Canada. Analyses were based on data from 1871 bears that were uniquely marked during the period 1972-97. Our best-fitting mark-recapture model specified sex and age effects on probabilities of survival and an effect of prior recapture (dependence) on capture probability. The most parsimonious solution in our analysis of survival was to assume the same rate for the Lancaster Sound and Norwegian Bay populations. Total (harvested) annual survival rates (mean ± 1 SE) for females included: 0.749 ± 0.105 (cubs), 0.879 ± 0.050 (ages 1-4), 0.936 ± 0.019 (ages 5-20), and 0.758 ± 0.054 (ages 21+). Mean litter size was 1.69 ± 0.01 cubs for females of Lancaster Sound and 1.71 ± 0.08 cubs for females of Norwegian Bay. By age six, on average 0.31 ± 0.21 females of Lancaster Sound were producing litters (first age of reproduction was five years); however, females of Norwegian Bay did not reproduce until age seven or more. Total abundance (1995-97) averaged 2541 ± 391 bears in Lancaster Sound and 203 ± 44 bears in Norwegian Bay. The finite rate of increase (γ) during the study period was estimated to be 1.001 ± 0.013 for bears of Lancaster Sound and 0.981 ± 0.027 for bears of Norwegian Bay. We incorporated demographic parameters into a harvest-explicit PVA to model short-term (15 yr) probabilities of overharvesting (i.e., 1997-2012). Our harvest simulations suggest that current levels of kill are approaching and perhaps exceeding the sustainable yield in both populations. "
1373,2307,"Status and trends of some large mammals and ostriches in Waza National Park, Cameroon","An aerial sample count of large mammals and ostriches was carried out in the Waza National Park, Cameroon, using systematic transect sampling. Total population estimates are given and distribution maps are presented for seven species. Results are compared with three previous estimates. Population sizes of giraffe, roan antelope, and topi showed a limited increase since 1977. Rather surprisingly, the population of kobs, the most abundant larger herbivore, had increased dramatically. Red‐fronted gazelle and ostrich seemed to maintain their stock. Elephants showed a significant increase of 9·3% per annum since 1977. It is recommended that quantitative data be collected on the increasing elephant crop damages and that measures be taken to limit human/elephant conflicts. The Acacia seyal zone appeared to be an important wildlife habitat. It is suggested that this habitat should be permanently monitored given the increase in wildlife numbers and the changes in local hydrological conditions. The cost of the aerial survey was about US$2·30 per km2, a quite expensive operation for local low‐budget Wildlife Department and Research Institutes."
1374,1570,Cloud Forest Bird Responses to Unusually Severe Storm Damage,"In 1998, storms related to Hurricane Iris caused extensive gaps in the cloud forest of El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico, where severe storms are infrequent. We examined how this disturbance aflected bird species composition. Species richness and composition were similar both between pre- and post-disturbance forest and between newly created gaps and plots thar remained forested after the hurricane. However, differences in response guilds were greater between pre- and post-disturbance plots than between forest plots with gaps arter disturbance. Granivorous, omnivorous, and terrestrial species were more abundant before the hurricane, whereas insectivorous, midstory, and generalist foragers were more abundant after the hurricane. In addition, species with high sensitivity to disturbance were more abundant in the pre-disturbance forest, while low sensitivity species were more abundant after disturbance. In the post-disturbance forest, insectivorous species were most abundant in gaps and terrestrial-canopy foragers were most abundant in forest plots. Permanently open areas had significantly lower species richness, but had lowland generalist and second-growth species not present in the cloud forest. Results suggest that changes in species composition were not limited to the newly created gaps, but also affected the whole forest. The decline of high sensitivity species after disturbance supports the hypothesis that disturbance negatively affects specialists and benefits generalist species. Although there is evidence that natural communities tend to return to pre-disturbance conditions, changes in community structure could be aggravated if recurrent hurricanes occur before succession takes place."
1375,2325,"Population status of the hippopotamus on the Luangwa River, Zambia","Hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius L.) were censused by both ground and aerial surveys along a 165 km stretch of the Luangwa River, Zambia. Total numbers of 6293 and 6544 were estimated for 1982 ground and 1983 aerial counts, respectively. The 1982 density was 38 hippopotami per river km for the whole study area, with a total of 343 hippopotamus schools. The ratio of calves to adults in the ground counts was 0.048: 1. The population growth for the whole study area since 1970 shows an annual increase of 7%. Hippopotamus densities in Luangwa are now twice those recorded in Uganda when a management cull was initiated there in the 1950s."
1376,2726,Comparative Influence of Ocean Conditions on Yellowfin and Atlantic Bluefin Tuna Catch from Longlines in the Gulf of Mexico,"<p>Directed fishing effort for Atlantic bluefin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), their primary spawning grounds in the western Atlantic, has been prohibited since the 1980s due to a precipitous decline of the spawning stock biomass. However, pelagic longlines targeted at other species, primarily yellowfin tuna and swordfish, continue to catch Atlantic bluefin tuna in the GOM as bycatch. Spatial and temporal management measures minimizing bluefin tuna bycatch in the GOM will likely become important in rebuilding the western Atlantic bluefin stock. In order to help inform management policy and understand the relative distribution of target and bycatch species in the GOM, we compared the spatiotemporal variability and environmental influences on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of yellowfin (target) and bluefin tuna (bycatch). Catch and effort data from pelagic longline fisheries observers (1993â2005) and scientific tagging cruises (1998â2002) were coupled with environmental and biological data. Negative binomial models were used to fit the data for both species and Akaike's Information Criterion (corrected for small sample size) was used to determine the best model. Our results indicate that bluefin CPUE had higher spatiotemporal variability as compared to yellowfin CPUE. Bluefin CPUE increased substantially during the breeding months (March-June) and peaked in April and May, while yellowfin CPUE remained relatively high throughout the year. In addition, bluefin CPUE was significantly higher in areas with negative sea surface height anomalies and cooler sea surface temperatures, which are characteristic of mesoscale cyclonic eddies. In contrast, yellowfin CPUE was less sensitive to environmental variability. These differences in seasonal variability and sensitivity to environmental influences suggest that bluefin tuna bycatch in the GOM can be reduced substantially by managing the spatial and temporal distribution of the pelagic longline effort without substantially impacting yellowfin tuna catches.</p>"
1377,3983,Increased autumn rainfall disrupts predator-prey interactions in fragmented boreal forests,"There is a pressing need to understand how changing climate interacts with land-use change to affect predatorprey; interactions in fragmented landscapes. This is particularly true in boreal ecosystems facing fast climate change and; intensification in forestry practices. Here, we investigated the relative influence of autumn climate and habitat quality; on the food-storing behaviour of a generalist predator, the pygmy owl, using a unique data set of 15 850 prey items; recorded in western Finland over 12 years. Our results highlighted strong effects of autumn climate (number of days; with rainfall and with temperature <0 °C) on food-store composition. Increasing frequency of days with precipitation; in autumn triggered a decrease in (i) total prey biomass stored, (ii) the number of bank voles (main prey) stored, and; (iii) the scaled mass index of pygmy owls. Increasing proportions of old spruce forests strengthened the functional; response of owls to variations in vole abundance and were more prone to switch from main prey to alternative prey; (passerine birds) depending on local climate conditions. High-quality habitat may allow pygmy owls to buffer negative; effects of inclement weather and cyclic variation in vole abundance. Additionally, our results evidenced sexspecific; trends in body condition, as the scaled mass index of smaller males increased while the scaled mass index of; larger females decreased over the study period, probably due to sex-specific foraging strategies and energy requirements.; Long-term temporal stability in local vole abundance refutes the hypothesis of climate-driven change in vole; abundance and suggests that rainier autumns could reduce the vulnerability of small mammals to predation by; pygmy owls. As small rodents are key prey species for many predators in northern ecosystems, our findings raise; concern about the impact of global change on boreal food webs through changes in main prey vulnerability."
1378,1672,Increase in cetacean and seabird numbers in the Canal de Ballenas during an El Nino-Southern Oscillation event,"In the Canal de Ballenas, central Gulf of California, primary productivity is based on tidal mixing and appears unaffected by ENSO events. Between the ENSO year of 1983 and the anti-ENSO year of 1985 the authors censused 4 piscivores (Bryde's whale Balaenoptera edeni; common dolphin Delphinus delphis; blue-footed booby Sula nebouxii, and brown booby S. leucoagster) and three planktivores (fin whale B. physalus; black storm petrel Oceanodroma melania; and least storm petrel O. microsoma). For all species the number of individuals sighted per hour declined by 77-94% over the 3 yr period. This suggests that during ENSO events the Canal de Ballenas may serve as a refugium of high productivity and prey abundance for these highly mobile marine animals. -from Authors"
1379,1474,"Modeling density dependence and climatic disturbances in caribou: a case study from the Bathurst Island complex, Canadian High Arctic","Peary caribou Rangifer tarandus pearyi is the northernmost subspecies of Rangifer in North America and endemic to the Canadian High Arctic. Because of severe population declines following years of unfavorable winter weather with ice coating on the ground or thicker snow cover, it is believed that density-independent disturbance events are the primary driver for Peary caribou population dynamics. However, it is unclear to what extent density dependence may affect population dynamics of this species. Here, we test for different levels of density dependence in a stochastic, single-stage population model, based on available empirical information for the Bathurst Island complex (BIC) population in the Canadian High Arctic. We compare predicted densities with observed densities during 1961-2001 under various assumptions of the strength of density dependence. On the basis of our model, we found that scenarios with no or very low density dependence led to population densities far above observed densities. For average observed disturbance regimes, a carrying capacity of 0.1 caribou km-2 generated an average caribou density similar to that estimated for the BIC population over the past four decades. With our model we also tested the potential effects of climate change-related increases in the probability and severity of disturbance years, that is unusually poor winter conditions. On the basis of our simulation results, we found that, in particular, potential increases in disturbance severity (as opposed to disturbance frequency) may pose a considerable threat to the persistence of this species.

1380,3813,"Past, present and future conservation of the greater one-horned rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis in Nepal","Until the early 1980s the only surviving population of the greater one-horned rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis in Nepal was in Chitwan National Park. Between 1986 and 2003 87 rhinoceroses from Chitwan were translocated into Bardia National Park and Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in the western terai region to establish founder populations and reduce the threat of local extinction from natural catastrophic events, disease and/or poaching. The founder populations increased in number through births but a rise in poaching during the period of civil strife in Nepal during 19962006 resulted in a dramatic decline in the populations, including in Chitwan. In 2001 the Terai Arc Landscape programme was initiated to connect 11 protected areas in Nepal and north-west India and facilitate dispersal of megafauna and manage them as metapopulations. Corridors that were restored under the programme and that connect Bardia and Suklaphanta with protected areas in India are now used by the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The successes and failures of the last 2 decades indicate that new paradigms for protecting rhinoceroses within and outside protected areas are needed, especially with reference to managing this species at a landscape scale."
1381,1343,"Detecting a decline in whale shark Rhincodon typus sightings in the Andaman Sea, Thailand, using ecotourist operator-collected data","In this paper, we analyse long-term whale shark Rhincodon typus sightings collected by ecotourist operators and evaluate the validity of conclusions drawn from the data for scientific and conservation purposes. To date information about the basic ecology and movements of whale sharks is sparse, and only recently has the species received global conservation attention. A dive company in Phuket, Thailand, documented whale shark sightings in the Andaman Sea for 10 years along 300 km of coastline. Whale shark sightings, corrected for effort, dropped by 96% between 1998 and 2001. Combining the seasons from 1992 to 1998, the number of whale shark sightings increased significantly from October to May. The sizes of sharks observed suggest that the majority were juveniles. We discuss the limitations of using ecotourist operators as non-specialist volunteers for data collection but conclude that their use can be beneficial for long-term, broad geographic studies such as this.

1382,3703,Predation pressure by avian predators suggests summer limitation of small-mammal populations in the Canadian Arctic,"Predation has been suggested to be especially important in simple food webs and less productive ecosystems such as the arctic tundra, but very few data are available to evaluate this hypothesis. We examined the hypothesis that avian predators could drive the population dynamics of two cyclic lemming species in the Canadian Arctic. A dense and diverse suite of predatory birds, including the Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus), the Rough-legged Hawk (Buteo lagopus), and the Long-tailed Jaeger (Stercorarius longicaudus), inhabits the arctic tundra and prey on collared (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) and brown (Lemmus trimucronatus) lemmings during the snow-free period. We evaluated the predation pressure exerted by these predators by combining their numerical (variation in breeding and fledgling numbers) and functional (variation in diet and daily consumption rates) responses to variations in lemming densities over the 20042010 period. Breeding density and number of fledglings produced by the three main avian predators increased sharply without delay in response to increasing lemming densities. The proportion of collared lemmings in the diet of those predators was high at low lemming density (both species) but decreased as lemming density increased. However, we found little evidence that their daily consumption rates vary in relation to changes in lemming density. Total consumption rate by avian predators initially increased more rapidly for collared lemming but eventually leveled off at a much higher value for brown lemmings, the most abundant species at our site. The combined daily predation rate of avian predators exceeded the maximum daily potential growth rates of both lemming species except at the highest recorded densities for brown lemmings. We thus show, for the first time, that predation pressure exerted without delay by avian predators can limit populations of coexisting lemming species during the snow-free period, and thus, that predation could play a role in the cyclic dynamic of these species in the tundra."
1383,917,Raptors and Red Grouse: Conservation Conflicts and Management Solutions,"Recovering predator populations may present problems for conservationists if their prey are of economic or conservation value. We address this issue by examining the conflict between raptor conservation and management of Red Grouse (Lagopus 1. scoticus) in Britain. Heather moorland is a distinctive habitat that supports an important assemblage of breeding birds. Large areas of moorland are managed by private landowners for shooting grouse. Although grouse shooting benefits conservation by retaining heather moorland, it is currently unclear whether grouse management directly benefits other upland birds. Human persecution has greatly restricted the range and abundance of most raptor species in Britain. Following the introduction of bird protection laws, the decline in gamekeeping, and the restriction of organochlorine pesticides, raptor populations have started to recover. Persecution of raptors on grouse moors is widespread and limits the range and abundance of Hen Harriers (Circus cyaneus), Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus), and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos). In some circumstances, raptor predation can reduce both the breeding density and productivity of Red Grouse. Limitation of grouse populations through raptor predation is most likely to occur where raptors are at high density because of the abundance of alternative prey, and grouse are at low density either because of poor management or the cyclic nature of some grouse populations. In the long term, habitat management may reduce densities of alternative prey, leading to reductions in raptor densities and their predation on grouse. More active intervention may be required, however, if grouse moors are to remain viable in the short-term. Current research is focused on manipulating harrier diet through diversionary feeding. Complementary research is needed to investigate methods to reduce raptor numbers locally while ensuring their national status."
1384,1370,Raptor predation and population limitation in red grouse,"1. We assessed the impact of predation by hen harriers and peregrine falcons on a red grouse population in southern Scotland during 1992-98. Grouse density in April, July and October declined during this time, coincident with an increase in the numbers of breeding harriers and peregrines. 2. Winter losses of grouse between October and April averaged 33% and were density-dependent. Raptors were the cause of about 70% of winter mortality and they killed about 30% of the grouse present in October. We were unable to determine whether winter mortality in raptors was additive to other losses. 3. Summer losses of adult grouse between April and July averaged 30% and were density-dependent. Raptors were the cause of more than 90% of the early summer mortality of adult grouse. Summer losses of grouse chicks between May and July averaged 45% and were not density-dependent. Harriers killed about 28% of grouse chicks by late July and about 37% by the end of August. Summer raptor predation on adult grouse and chicks appeared to be largely additive to other losses and we estimated that it reduced autumn grouse densities by about 50%. 4. A model combining the estimated reduction in autumn grouse density caused by raptors with the observed density dependence in winter loss predicted that, in the absence of raptors for 2 years, grouse density in spring would be 1.9 times greater, and grouse density in autumn 3.9 times greater, than in the presence of raptors. The model suggested that raptor predation prevented the grouse population from increasing and was thus a limiting factor."
1385,3632,Distribution and breeding biology of offshore cichlids in Lake Malawi/Niassa,"Lake Malawi/Niassa is the second largest rift valley lake in Africa, with an area of 28 800 km2, and an average and maximum depth of 292 m and >700 m, respectively. The lake is well known for the great diversity of fish occurring in the inshore zone. However, the offshore fish community is poorly documented. To rectify this, regular sampling was undertaken over two years, using trawl and gillnets at six offshore locations. This paper reports on the species composition, spatial distribution and breeding biology of the dominant cichlids species from the offshore pelagic zone. Cichlids formed approximately 88% of the offshore fish biomass. Most abundant were two species of zooplanktivores in the genus Diploturodon that made up 71% of the offshore fish biomass. An undescribed species, given the cheironym D. 'bigeye', was mainly found at a depth of 220 m during the day, but moved into near surface waters at night when the moon was full. This species was absent from the shallow regions of the lake. The most abundant offshore species was D. limnothrissa, which was distributed evenly throughout the lake to depths of 220 m. A less common offshore zooplanktivore was Copadichromis quadrimaculatus that formed 5%, of the biomass and was confined to the upper l00m of the water column. The main piscivores were in the genus Rhamphochromis and formed approximately 10% of the offshore fish biomass. The two dominant taxa were R. longiceps and the 'large Rhamphochromis' group, and both were more common in the southern half of the lake. The former occurred mainly in the upper 100 m of the water column and the latter mainly at depths of 100-150 m. The length at maturity and fecundity for the dominant offshore species were estimated and seasonal breeding cycles determined from gonad activity and gonado-somatic indices."
1386,3382,Prey choice by marten during a decline in prey abundance,"We examined variation in diet choice by marten (Martes americana) among seasons and between sexes and ages from 1980-1985. During this period prey populations crashed simultaneously, except for ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) which was common at the beginning and end of the study, and masked shrews (Sorex cinereus) which were abundant in 1983. Marten were catholic in selection of prey and made use of most available mammalian prey, ruffed grouse, passerine birds, berries, and insects. Diet niche was widest during the latter three years when prey was scare, particularly in late winter. Diet niche breadth was negatively correlated with abundance of all common prey species. Proportion of small prey species in the diet was correlated with absolute abundance of those species, but proportion of some large prey was related to their relative abundance. Diet choice varied among years and among seasons. Berries and insects were common in summer diets while large prey, particularly varying hare (Lepus americanus), were more frequent in winter diet than in summer diet. We found little evidence that any small mammal species was a preferred prey. Sexual size dimorphism between the sexes did not affect prey choice, nor did age. Reduced foraging effort in winter resulted in a wider diet niche only when prey was scarce. The only prediction of optimal foraging models fully supported by our data was a wider diet niche with reduced prey abundance. However, among the three most profitable prey species choice was dependent on the absolute abundance of the most profitable type (varying hare). We suggest that marten primarily forage for large prey but employ a strategy which results in encounters with small prey as well. These small prey are eaten as they provide energy at minimal cost, between captures of large prey. "
1387,2388,"The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in the central German Bight: phenology, abundance and distribution in 2002–2004","The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is widely distributed in the North Sea. During both the SCANS 1994 and 2005 surveys, porpoises were commonly encountered in offshore waters, for example in the central German Bight. However, information on year-round abundance and distribution of harbour porpoises in that area on a monthly basis was lacking. Between 2002 and 2004, we undertook 26 aerial line-transect surveys in a 2,600 km2 area in the central German Bight, 100 km north of the Island of Borkum (Eastern Frisia). Data were analysed with DISTANCE software. A total of 406 porpoises were sighted. Sighting rates (=sightings/km transect) peaked in July 2002, February, May and September 2003, and in January and April 2004. Absolute densities (g (0) corrected) ranged between 0.14 and 1.54 animals/km2 (peak in April 2004). Proportion of calves varied between 3.4 and 27.3%. Our results show a highly irregular appearance of harbour porpoises in the study area with no apparent seasonal trends in occurrence but peaks in single months. We propose that the area is used as a transit route with harbour porpoise moving in from regions of high density in summer (Northern Frisia) and early spring (Eastern Frisia). "
1388,1211,Wild Populations of the Chinese alligator approach extinction,"The Chinese alligator, Alligator sinensis, is on the verge of becoming extinct in the wild as a result of loss of natural wetlands in the lower Changjiang valley. Chinese alligators are only known from a small region in southeastern Anhui province, a fraction of its former distribution. Within this area, a 433 km2 reserve has been declared that contains 13 designated habitat sites totaling 41 ha. The sites consist of small ponds located within or adjacent to villages, are completely surrounded by rice fields, or are biologically marginal oligotrophic ponds set in low hills. Alligators are only present at 10 of the 13 designated sites, with the largest groups containing a maximum of 10-11 animals and one adult female. In recent years nesting is known from only four areas, but the eggs are routinely collected and hatchlings retained in the Anhui alligator breeding center. The total population of wild Chinese alligators is probably < 130 and is declining at an annual rate of 4-6%. If present trends continue, the Chinese alligator will be the first species of crocodilian to become extinct in the wild in historical times. Conservation efforts need to focus on protection of remaining wetlands and wetland restoration, and the inclusion of Chinese alligators in the active management of protected wetlands sites throughout the species' historic distribution. "
1389,604,The Conservation Status of the Chinese Alligator,"The Chinese alligator Alligator sinensis is one of the world's most endangered reptiles. At one time widespread throughout much of the lower Yangzi River basin, the remaining wild individuals are now restricted to a small area in southern Anhui Province and perhaPS in adjacent Zhejiang Province. Population estimates conducted in the 1980s suggested that only 500-735 wild individuals remained at that time. Current figures suggest that the wild population is c. 400 individuals and continues to decline. The principal factor contributing to historic population decline has been habitat loss, but deliberate killing of alligators and the heavy use of pesticides have also had significant negative effects. The current conservation programme in Anhui Province is based on captive breeding and the establishment of a reserve for small groups of wild alligators. However, the inferred recent decline in the size of the wild population suggests that the reserve design is inadequate for the long-term survival of alligators. Programmes to survey the status of the remaining wild populations and evaluate the feasibility of establishing new wild populations by reintroducing captive-bred animals are currently being developed."
1390,2026,"Population changes of the Torresian imperial-pigeon Ducula spilorrhoa over twenty-one years on North Brook Island, north Queensland","Torresian Imperial-Pigeons, a breeding summer migrant to northern Australia, were counted during their evening return flight to North Brook Island. 29 km off Cardwell, from 1965/66 to 1985/86. In the first four years numbers declined from 4692 to a low of 1451 in the 1968/9 season, followed by a recovery over eight years to a December maximum of 9808. Thereafter, counts have fluctuated beteen about 10 000-13 000 Imperial-Pigeons returning to the island in the evening flight, except for a sudden increase to 21 815 in January 1986. The population decline is attributed to shooting of the Imperial-Pigeons at the nesting colony, and the population recovery protection."
1391,2105,Variations in the abundance of Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) from the northwestern Pacific in relation to oceanic-climate changes,"Effects of oceanic-climate changes on the abundance of Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) in the northwestern Pacific during the last half century were investigated. Abundance indices of both large and medium size groups exhibit interannual-decadal variations, but their patterns were different. The large and medium size groups of saury are corresponding to the recruitments of winter- and spring-cohort, respectively. The abundance of large size group saury was significantly correlated with the winter sea surface temperature (SST) in the Kuroshio region, whereas the medium size group saury showed high correlations with SST in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone and the Oyashio region, indicating that the two size groups are affected by subtropical and subarctic environment, respectively. Significant negative correlation between the abundance index and the southern oscillation index (SOI) suggested that El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) events have marked impacts on the large size group saury. Subtropical high pressure index and far east zonal index also show high correlations with the abundance of both large and medium size group saury, indicating a linkage between large-scale atmospheric circulation and the abundance of saury. These correlations demonstrate that the abundance of Pacific saury is directly affected by the SST fields through large-scale atmosphere-ocean interactions from the equatorial Pacific to mid- and high-latitude areas such as El Nino events."
1392,4419,Population density estimation of southern stingrays Dasyatis americana on a Caribbean atoll using distance sampling,"The southern stingray Dasyatis americana is a benthic mesopredator found in varying densities throughout Caribbean shallow reef systems, yet despite its increasing inclusion in fisheries, many aspects of its population ecology are still unknown. Belt transects and distance sampling techniques were used to estimate seasonal abundance of an unexploited, isolated population of southern stingrays in lagoon and forereef habitats at Glovers Reef Atoll, Belize. Southern stingrays were the most abundant elasmobranch in both shallow lagoon margin (< 5m) and shallow forereef (< 15m) habitats in all sampling seasons. Lagoon density showed no seasonal variation and was estimated at 245 (95% CI 226-265) individuals per km2. Forereef sampling indicated lower densities compared with the lagoon habitat, as well as seasonality with a significantly lower stingray density in November of 25 (16-37) compared with either of the April surveys of 100 (71-141) and 78 (53-116). Total population size for all lagoon habitat was estimated as ~8400 stingrays (7700-9100, 4%CV). This is the first study known to utilize distance sampling techniques on benthic elasmobranchs. Absolute estimates of population density are crucial in wildlife management and will be an important tool in tracking community and trophic dynamics in affected systems of declining top predators, particularly in species devoid of natural identifying marks.

1393,19,The decline and impending extinction of the South China Tiger.,"The South China tiger Panthera tigris amoyensis is the rarest of the five living tiger subspecies, the most critically threatened and the closest to extinction. No wild South China tigers have been seen by officials for 25 years and one was last brought into captivity 27 years ago. The 19 reserves listed by the Chinese Ministry of Forestry within the presumed range of the tiger are spatially fragmented and most are too small to support viable tiger populations. Over the last 40 years wild populations have declined from thousands to a scattered few. Despite its plight and occasional anecdotal reports of sightings by local people, no intensive field study has been conducted on this tiger subspecies and its habitat. The captive population of about 50 tigers, derived from six wild-caught founders, is genetically impoverished with low reproductive output. Given the size and fragmentation of potential tiger habitat, saving what remains of the captive population may be the only option left to prevent extinction of this tiger subspecies, and even this option is becoming increasingly less probable. This precarious dilemma demands that conservation priorities be re-evaluated and action taken immediately to decide if recovery of the wild population will be possible."
1394,4585,Main potential drivers of trout population dynamics in bypassed stream sections,"The key role of hydrological variability in structuring brown trout populations is well established. However, the influence of additional drivers is more difficult to identify. The implementation of long-term monitoring and the development of reliable tools can help to reveal fine local drivers structuring fish populations in contrasted flow regimes. This study used data series for nine reaches monitored for nine to nineteen years in four French salmonid streams. Study reaches were within five bypassed sections influenced by instream flow. A deterministic trout population dynamics model was applied on each reach, with calibration and validation procedures. Results revealed that biological drivers structured all reaches similarly. In addition, seven other drivers were identified. Among these additional drivers, hydrology mainly explained temporal fluctuations in trout density, regardless of reach. Three drivers independent of hydrology were also revealed: poor water quality, limited spawning area and the effect of power plant operations (overtopping, flushing or plant shutdown). All drivers influenced the whole bypassed section and were never limited to the scale of the reach (sampling area). Further analyses of each driver are now needed, to regionalise and quantify their respective impact precisely. Thus, assessment of trout population status would be simplified, enabling implementation of efficient management rules."

1396,3807,Estimates of density and sustainable harvest of the lowland tapir Tapirus terrestris in the Amazon of French Guiana using a Bayesian spatially explicit capture–recapture model,"The Amazonian moist forest, which covers most of French Guiana, is one of the core habitats for the lowland tapir Tapirus terrestris. Tapirs are hunted in French Guiana, although a law introduced in 2011 restricts hunting to one animal per person per hunting trip. We carried out cameratrap surveys in the Nouragues Nature Reserve for 4 years, with the goal of estimating tapir densities in undisturbed conditions and determining sustainable harvest levels for tapirs in French Guiana. We analysed our data with a Bayesian spatially explicit capturerecapture model, with parameter sharing across surveys to improve estimates, and used the model to calculate derived parameters such as maximum sustainable harvest levels. Density estimates for all four surveys were similar and the model indicated a difference in encounter rates for the two camera models used but no difference in encounter rates or home range sizes for males and females or between years. Based on the calculated density of 0.32 tapir km?2 we estimated sustainable harvest levels at 0.009 tapir km?2. Comparing this value to hunting surveys from 11 sites between 1999 and 2006, we found that hunting levels were unsustainable in at least seven villages. We conclude that even the new restrictive hunting law will not prevent overhunting of tapirs in certain areas and thus stronger regulations are needed. However, because of the remoteness of tapir habitat in many parts of French Guiana tapirs are not immediately threatened in the country as a whole."
1397,3906,A modelling approach to determine a translocation scenario for the endangered New Zealand frog Leiopelma hamiltoni,"A stage-structured population model was developed to predict which of nine hypothetical translocation scenarios was likely to produce the best outcome for the rare Hamiltons frog (Leiopelma hamiltoni  McCulloch).  Model outcome was measured in terms of population growth rate and probability of extinction.  Only females were modelled.  The model predicted that moving at least 20 female adult frogs was the best strategy, and moving subadult frogs alone, or no frogs at all was the worst in terms of mean growth rate of  both populations combined. When the new population was considered separately, introducing subadults alone was the worst strategy in terms of mean growth rate and extinction probability. Extinction of the donor population was most likely when 40 adult females were removed, and the extinction risk was reduced when only 20 were removed. We consider the most reasonable management strategy confirmed by the modelling and supporting qualitative data-  is the translocation of 20 adult and 20 subadult female frogs (with the concurrent translocation of 40 males). This scenario provides a balance between risk of extinction in the donor population and probability of success in the translocated population. "
1398,4022,The inter-island translocation of the New Zealand frog Leiopelma hamiltoni,"Leiopelma hamiltoni from Maud Island, Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand is confined; to two populations totalling approximately 19,000 individuals. In May 1997, 300 L. hamiltoni from; Maud Island were translocated to nearby Motuara Island in an effort to expand their distribution and; lower the risk of extinction for the species. By August 2002, 155 of the translocated frogs had been; recaptured and the population contained a range of young to old frogs. Population estimates indicated; the population on Motuara Island had stabilised with losses of the translocated frogs offset by new; recruits. The first juvenile frog was found in January 1998, only 10 months after the translocation and; 42 recruits were captured by August 2002. Although initial survival was low for the translocated frogs,; survival following the initial 2-month settling-in period was high (71-100%). New recruits produced; on Motuara Island had survival rates of 29-88%. Capture-recapture analyses support the view that; the survival estimates include a large dispersal component. The a priori criteria for a successful; translocation were met; the appropriateness of the Motuara Island habitat for breeding and adult; survival was demonstrated."
1399,1933,Effects of forest removal on amphibian migrations: implications for habitat and landscape connectivity,"1. Habitat loss is a leading cause of global amphibian declines. Forest removal is a particularly significant threat because an estimated 82% of amphibians rely on forests for part of their lives. 2. Biphasic amphibians rely on suitable terrestrial habitat to support their post-metamorphic growth and survival and also to maintain appropriate habitat and landscape connectivity. 3. We created 4 replicate, 16-ha experimental arrays in the southeastern USA to examine the effects of forest removal on migratory movements of adult biphasic amphibians. Each array contained four forest-harvesting treatments that included an unharvested control, a partially harvested stand, a clearcut with coarse woody debris retained, and a clearcut with coarse woody debris removed. 4. Some amphibian species emigrated from wetlands in significantly greater numbers through forest controls compared with harvested treatments. Also, salamanders were generally more sensitive to forest removal than were frogs, with a significantly greater proportion of salamanders migrating through forested habitat compared to frogs. 5. For several species, individuals were significantly more likely to avoid clearcuts when emigrating compared to immigrating. Individuals that emigrated into clearcut treatments were more likely to reverse direction and return to wetlands in some species. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our study identifies one mechanism by which forest removal shapes the abundance and distribution of amphibians in terrestrial habitat. To promote the persistence of amphibian populations, conservation efforts should focus on preserving forest habitat adjacent to reproduction sites. Such measures are especially important where forest habitat connects local populations or where it links reproduction sites to other habitat features necessary for amphibian growth, survival, or overwintering.

1400,4174,"Size, distribution and catch rates of the oceanic whitetip shark caught by the Brazilian tuna longline fleet","Catch and effort data from 14,835 longline sets conducted by foreign tuna longline vessels chartered by Brazil, from 2004 to 2010, were analyzed aiming at assessing the size, distribution and the relative abundance of the oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) in the southwestern and equatorial Atlantic Ocean. The nominal catch per unit of effort (CPUE) exhibited a gradual increase, from 0.04 sharks/1000 hooks, in 2004, the first year of the time series, up to 0.13, in 2007. In 2008, however, the CPUE increased sharply, reaching 0.43, dropping, then, back to 0.15, in 2010. A CPUE standardization was performed using a delta-GLM approach, but the standardized index of abundance did not differ significantly from the nominal CPUE. The models indicated that the catches of oceanic whitetip sharks are higher for the Spanish fishing strategy, which is characterized by the deployment of hooks at shallower depths. These results indicate that the use of deep longline hooks (>100. m) may help to mitigate the bycatch of this species. "
1401,3828,"Nesting ecology of East Pacific green turtles at Playa Cabuyal, Gulf of Papagayo, Costa Rica","East Pacific green turtles (Chelonia mydas), often referred to as black turtles, are smaller and exhibit a lower reproductive output than other populations of green turtles in the Atlantic, Indian and Western Pacific Oceans.  Knowledge of nesting ecology of East Pacific green turtles is limited to general descriptions. We conducted an exhaustive analysis of the nesting ecology of East Pacific green turtles at Playa Cabuyal, North Pacific Costa Rica. Compared with other populations of green turtles, East Pacific turtles exhibited smaller clutch sizes (mean  SD: 76.9  18.2 eggs per clutch), but the number of clutches (estimated clutch frequency (ECF): 4.3  2.3 clutches) fell within the upper limit reported for green turtles. Clutch size and seasonal reproductive output (409  135 eggs per female), but not ECF, increased with female size. The observed internesting period (OIP) between consecutive oviposition events (mean  SD: 15.4  2.9 days) increased as the season progressed and was approximately 2 days longer than the mean OIP reported for the species. Most clutches were laid in the upper vegetated part of beach (zone 3, 75%) and within this zone, tended to be located underneath trees (79%). Hatching success of clutches laid underneath trees was significantly higher (0.89  0.17) than that of clutches laid in the exposed areas of zone 3 (0.75  0.33). Mean duration of the nesting process (3:14 h) was on average 45 min longer than previously reported for the species. Frequency of false crawls was high (49% of nesting activities), and nesting success was low (54% of nesting attempts). Poaching of eggs, tourism and predation by dogs were important threats to this population. Conservation actions were being successfully implemented at the local level due to presence of beach patrollers, but official protection is needed for the preservation of the nesting population into the future."
1402,4045,Reservoir refilling enhances growth and recruitment of an endangered remnant riverine fish,"Rapid increases in native riverine fish populations associated with trophic upsurge immediately following reservoir construction are well documented. Repeated upsurge periods and extended benefits to populations are, however, less understood. We used sclerochronology to investigate fish growth and netting surveys to estimate recruitment and abundance of a lacustrine population of an Australian riverine fish, the Macquarie perch (Macquaria australasica) in Lake Dartmouth. Record low inflows from 1997 to 2008 caused the reservoir to shrink to its lowest volume since construction. Refilling began in 2008, reaching 99% capacity in 2013. We hypothesized that fish growth, recruitment, and abundance would increase in response to the refilling of the lake, reproducing a similar response to the initial filling period. Our findings supported this hypothesis. Macquarie perch growth, recruitment, and abundance were enhanced during the refilling of Lake Dartmouth. Growth, best explained by the effects of dam height, change in dam height, temperature (and their interactions), and recruitment, were highest during the first years of refilling when lake levels and temperatures were low. We propose one or a combination of varying levels of intraspecific competition (low during initial filling and high following population expansion) and improved riverine conditions for reproductive success as the most plausible explanation. Our results suggest extended periods of low lake levels followed by rapid inundation events are likely to enhance recruitment and population growth opportunities for this species. While reservoir construction in general impacts negatively on native fish populations, the potential to offset these impacts for conservation management purposes should be considered."
1403,3830,Decline and demographic changes in the population of the Near Threatened brown lemur Eulemur fulvus on Mayotte,"The population of the Near Threatened brown lemur Eulemur fulvus on the island of Mayotte was censused in 1974, 1984 and 1999. We carried out a new census in 2008, estimating individual and group densities in the three main habitat types on the island (preserved forest, anthropogenic forest and agricultural areas), and more generally evaluating population trends. Data included sex ratios and the number of young < 1 year-old per female. The census was at the end of the dry season, along 14 transect lines of 0.5 or 1 km length. Counts of groups and individuals were repeated three times between 07.00 and 10.00 and between 15.00 and 18.00. The densities of groups and individuals were calculated using Distance. By 2008 group and individual densities had significantly decreased in preserved forest, and there was also a decrease in group size in all habitat types. The 2008 census also showed that the overall population of E. fulvus on Mayotte has decreased by about half since 1999. We suggest that these changes reflect environmental stress associated with a decrease in available food resources. Urgent action to preserve forest habitat is necessary for the long-term survival of this lemur."
1404,2222,The Spanish population of the white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala) twenty five years after 1977,"The evolution of white headed duck (Oxyura leucophala) Spanish population is analysed since the historical minimum of 1977. In 2002 it has been 25 years since those unfortunate days when this species could be observed only in the lagoon Zonar and now it is the right time to analyse the response to the measures aimed to avoid the extinction of white-headed duck. The prohibition of hunting and the regeneration of many Spanish wetlands, mainly hydric, has allowed the increase of the number of specimens from 22 in 1977 to 2600 in 2002. Reproduction areas and areas where are present have been enlarged. It has been observed in 180 wetlands of 27 provinces in 12 Autonomous Communities and has reproduced in 62 wetlands of 7 provinces and 4 Autonomous Communities for 25 years. It has been stated a close relationship between the increase of the number of specimens and precipitation and there is a clear migration towards places with higher precipitation. All together has allowed a spectacular increase that was cut down when it reached 4500 specimens in september of 2000."
1405,3782,Alarming houbara bustard population trends in Asia,"Relative abundance and density estimates of Asian houbara were assessed during the breeding season in two breeding grounds of migrant populations (China and south Kazakhstan) and in one breeding ground of a resident population (Oman), between 1998 and 2002. For the study period, the relative abundance was from 0.004 to 0.06 individual per km driven and density estimates varied from 0.01 to 0.2 houbara per km 2. Relative abundance and density of houbara declined by 63% and 69%, respectively in China, by 60% and 49%, respectively in Kazakhstan and by 50% and 75%, respectively in Oman. Overall, an average of 27-30% annual decline in both relative abundance and density was observed for the three regions. Despite being legally a strictly protected species in China, Kazakhstan and Oman, houbara are heavily hunted and poached on all their migration routes and wintering grounds. The current levels of hunting and poaching are not sustainable and without the immediate agreement and implementation of international conservation measures, the Asian houbara may face extinction in the wild in the foreseeable future.

1406,4175,"Environmental Influences on the Abundance and Sexual Composition of White Sharks Carcharodon carcharias in Gansbaai, South Africa","The seasonal occurrence of white sharks visiting Gansbaai, South Africa was investigated from 2007 to 2011 using sightings from white shark cage diving boats. Generalized linear models were used to investigate the number of great white sharks sighted per trip in relation to sex, month, sea surface temperature and Multivariate El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Indices (MEI). Water conditions are more variable in summer than winter due to wind-driven cold water upwelling and thermocline displacement, culminating in colder water temperatures, and shark sightings of both sexes were higher during the autumn and winter months (MarchAugust). MEI, an index to quantify the strength of Southern Oscillation, differed in its effect on the recorded numbers of male and female white sharks, with highly significant interannual trends. This data suggests that water temperature and climatic phenomena influence the abundance of white sharks at this coastal site. In this study, more females were seen in Gansbaai overall in warmer water/positive MEI years. Conversely, the opposite trend was observed for males. In cool water years (2010 to 2011) sightings of male sharks were significantly higher than in previous years. The influence of environmental factors on the physiology of sharks in terms of their size and sex is discussed. The findings of this study could contribute to bather safety programmes because the incorporation of environmental parameters into predictive models may help identify times and localities of higher risk to bathers and help mitigate human-white shark interactions."
1407,666,"Cofán Indians' monitoring of freshwater turtles in Zábalo, Ecuador","The Cofán Indians of Aguarico and Zábalo Rivers in Ecuador in 1990 began a turtle recuperation effort by raising turtle hatchlings (Podocnemis expansa and P. unifilis) in small pools. To evaluate the effectiveness of this program, the Cofán developed and tested three methods to document changes in the populations of turtles. The first method consisted of interviews with people from neighbouring communities about their perceptions of changes in turtle abundance. The second method was a direct count of turtles observed along the rivers from canoe. The third method was an indirect count, involving turtle nest censusing along community beaches. Two of the methods yielded numerical, statistically positive turtle population trends. The turtle program has influenced the community's perception of turtle conservation issues so that, instead of hunting the adults and eggs, they now protect them. The training in record-keeping permits them to make a transparent history of the equitability of access to the turtle egg resource. The Cofán monitoring experience strengthened their successful petition to the Ecuadorian government for the rights to manage their territorial lands within the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve, and to receive protected area status and management rights to other ancestral lands. The experience gained by the Zábalo monitors is now serving as a model for the design and implementation of the park monitoring system of the newly-established Cofán Park Ranger Corps, which will be patrolling three Ecuadorian Ecological Reserves which overlap Cofán inhabited areas.

1408,2321,Modelling wildebeest population dynamics: implications for predation and harvesting in a closed system,"1. Predation upon ungulates is generally considered to have a stronger regulatory effect on sedentary than migratory populations, with migratory populations maintaining higher densities. The blue wildebeest Connochaetus taurinus is a migratory species that has suffered a general decline in numbers and distribution across its species range. Wildebeest suffer from a fragmented distribution together with isolation of populations in closed reserves, preventing migratory movements and potentially allowing predators to benefit from a 'captive' prey resource. 2. In Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, the declining blue wildebeest population (from 1074 in 1995 to 594 in 2001) is sedentary because the park (50 000 ha) is completely enclosed by fencing. This population was used to model the potential effects of predation and harvesting. The Pilanesberg population was then compared with other wildebeest populations in southern Africa. 3. The model outputs demonstrated that increased levels of predation by lions Panthera leo on a 'captive' population of prey such as wildebeest, in combination with regular harvesting by park managers, can drive the population towards extinction. At lower levels of predation some other factor needs to act in combination with predation to drive the population into a decline. 4. During our study the lion biomass density in Pilanesberg was almost three times greater than that predicted by regression models of the stable relationship between lion and prey biomass densities across African savannas. Furthermore, the ratio of lion numbers to prey numbers was substantially higher than in most other African reserves. 5. Synthesis and applications. In African savannas, artificial closed systems provide advantages to large predators. If wildlife-cropping schemes are implemented in such systems without careful monitoring and regulation of large predators, then ungulate populations can decline more rapidly than managers expect. "
1409,2586,First Recorded Loss of an Emperor Penguin Colony in the Recent Period of Antarctic Regional Warming: Implications for Other Colonies,"<p>In 1948, a small colony of emperor penguins <italic>Aptenodytes forsteri</italic> was discovered breeding on Emperor Island (67° 51? 52? S, 68° 42? 20? W), in the Dion Islands, close to the West Antarctic Peninsula (Stonehouse 1952). When discovered, the colony comprised approximately 150 breeding pairs; these numbers were maintained until 1970, after which time the colony showed a continuous decline. By 1999 there were fewer than 20 pairs, and in 2009 high-resolution aerial photography revealed no remaining trace of the colony. Here we relate the decline and loss of the Emperor Island colony to a well-documented rise in local mean annual air temperature and coincident decline in seasonal sea ice duration. The loss of this colony provides empirical support for recent studies (Barbraud &amp; Weimerskirch 2001; Jenouvrier et al 2005, 2009; Ainley et al 2010; Barber-Meyer et al 2005) that have highlighted the vulnerability of emperor penguins to changes in sea ice duration and distribution. These studies suggest that continued climate change is likely to impact upon future breeding success and colony viability for this species. Furthermore, a recent circumpolar study by Fretwell &amp; Trathan (2009) highlighted those Antarctic coastal regions where colonies appear most vulnerable to such changes. Here we examine which other colonies might be at risk, discussing various ecological factors, some previously unexplored, that may also contribute to future declines. The implications of this are important for future modelling work and for understanding which colonies actually are most vulnerable.</p>"
1410,3751,"Ecological drivers of change at South Georgia: the krill surplus, or climate variability","Macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus are thought to be one of the most important mesopredators in the Southern Ocean having a greater impact on prey availability and abundance than any other seabird species. Their population centre has long been held to be South Georgia where populations were thought to comprise many million animals. Here we report the results of a recent census of the macaroni population at South Georgia undertaken using aerial survey methods. We report dramatic declines in numbers (~1.0 million breeding pairs) compared to numbers observed in the late 1970s (~5.4 million pairs), but show that these reductions have occurred principally at sites where numbers had previously been very large. During the breeding season, the main foraging grounds of birds from these sites overlap with the foraging grounds of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella, a major competitor for their principal prey, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We suggest that the redistribution of the macaroni penguin population at South Georgia reflects the recent recovery of fur seal populations and thus the ongoing consequences of human intervention at South Georgia, a process which started more than 2 centuries previously. The implied resource competition and the observed population changes may also be exacerbated by recent reductions in Antarctic krill abundance which have been linked with reductions in seasonal sea ice following recent, rapid, regional warming in the Antarctic; however, the recovery of fur seal populations, and the ongoing recovery of krill-eating whale populations argues that tropho-dynamic interactions may be sufficient to explain the observed changes.

1411,4574,"Spatial dynamics and burrow occupancy in a desert lizard floodplain specialist, Liopholis slateri","1. Desert river floodplains are resource rich but high-risk habitats. For surface-dwelling animals in these habitats, persistence is a trade-off between the advantages of relatively abundant food resources and the costs of episodic surface disturbances from infrequent but unpredictable rainfall events. 2. In central Australia, there are few non-flying, terrestrial species that are specialised floodplain occupants, and their persistence strategies are not well understood. 3. Using photographic mark-recapture and scat DNA, we observed a population of one such desert floodplain specialist, Slater's skink Liopholis slateri, over four years to understand how it persists in these disturbance-prone habitats. 4. We found evidence of a highly mobile, but site stable population, with spatial clustering of burrows into local ‘neighbourhoods’. There were relatively low fluctuations in population size among years, with a second seasonal breeding event following heavy rain in January 2015. We observed both long-term residence of individuals and long-term use of burrows at the site. 5. Frequent movements within and among neighbourhoods, and regular burrow construction, suggest a population capable of dispersal in the event of high intensity disturbance. Dispersing individuals and some neighbourhoods may act as recolonization sources in the event of a flood extirpating the core population."
1412,3453,Empirical assessment of fish introductions in a subtropical wetland: an evaluation of contrasting views,"We summarized data from eight quantitative fish surveys conducted in southern Florida to evaluate the distribution and relative abundance of introduced fishes across a variety of habitats. These surveys encompassed marsh and canal habitats throughout most of the Everglades region, including the mangrove fringe of Florida Bay. Two studies provided systematically collected density information over a 20-year period, and documented the first local appearance of four introduced fishes based on their repeated absence in prior surveys. Those species displayed a pattern of rapid population growth followed by decline, then persistence at lower densities. Estuarine areas in the southern Everglades, characterized by natural tidal creeks surrounded by mangrove-dominated marshes, and canals held the largest introduced-fish populations. Introduced fishes were also common, at times exceeding 50% of the fish community, in solution holes that serve as dry-season refuges in short-hydroperiod rockland habitats of the eastern Everglades. Wet prairies and alligator ponds distant from canals generally held few individuals of introduced fishes. These patterns suggest that the introduced fishes in southern Florida at present may not be well-adapted to persist in freshwater marshes of the Everglades, possibly because of an interaction of periodic cold-temperature stress and hydrologic fluctuation. Our analyses indicated low densities of these fishes in central or northern Everglades wet-prairie communities, and, in the absence of experimental data, little evidence of biotic effects in this spatially extensive habitat. There is no guarantee that this condition will be maintained, especially under the cumulative effects of future invasions or environmental change."
1413,3463,Aquatic fauna as indicators for Everglades restoration: applying dynamic targets in assessments,"A major goal of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is to recover historical (pre-drainage) wading bird rookeries and reverse marked decreases in wading bird nesting success in Everglades National Park. To assess efforts to restore wading birds, a trophic hypothesis was developed that proposes seasonal concentrations of small-fish and crustaceans (i.e., wading bird prey) were a key factor to historical wading bird success. Drainage of the Everglades has diminished these seasonal concentrations, leading to a decline in wading bird nesting and displacing them from their historical nesting locations. The trophic hypothesis predicts that restoring historical hydrological patterns to pre-drainage conditions will recover the timing and location of seasonally concentrated prey, ultimately restoring wading bird nesting and foraging to the southern Everglades. We identified a set of indicators using small-fish and crustaceans that can be predicted from hydrological targets and used to assess management success in regaining suitable wading bird foraging habitat. Small-fish and crustaceans are key components of the Everglades food web and are sensitive to hydrological management, track hydrological history with little time lag, and can be studied at the landscape scale. The seasonal hydrological variation of the Everglades that creates prey concentrations presents a challenge to interpreting monitoring data. To account for the variable hydrology of the Everglades in our assessment, we developed dynamic hydrological targets that respond to changes in prevailing regional rainfall. We also derived statistical relationships between density and hydrological drivers for species representing four different life-history responses to drought. Finally, we use these statistical relationships and hydrological targets to set restoration targets for prey density. We also describe a report-card methodology to communicate the results of model-based assessments for communication to a broad audience. "
1414,1736,Shifts in native ungulate communities on a former cattle ranch in Tanzania,"When an area is brought under protection, current animal populations and their habitat preferences need to be assessed to predict population trends and future habitat availability. Using data from walking transects, we estimated the size of native ungulate populations on an abandoned cattle ranch in a coastal savannah in Tanzania, now included in the new Saadani National Park. Data were analysed with DISTANCE sampling and conventional strip transect techniques and were compared with results of previous wildlife counts. Few individuals of mainly browsing species were present in former cattle grazing areas exhibiting high bush-encroachment while a ten times higher biomass of browsers and grazers was found in the cattle-unmodified savannah. Population sizes of some species increased twofold between 1991 and 2001 within the entire area but neither population size nor species richness increased in the abandoned rangeland during our 3-year study period from 2001 to 2003. We conclude that the former ranch has potential for future recolonization by wild ungulates. Resettlement will take place gradually with 'pioneer-species' facilitating the entry of more demanding species. Habitat restoration through wildlife can be observed and quantified on Mkwaja Ranch which will be of importance for future management of native ungulates reclaiming abandoned rangeland. "
1415,1338,The decline of Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatus in Alaska: a review of the nutritional stress hypothesis,"1. The decline of Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatus in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands between the late 1970s and 1990s may have been related to reduced availability of suitable prey. many studies have shown that pinnipeds and other mammals suffering from nutritional stress typically exhibit reduced body size, reduced productivity, high mortality of pups and juveniles, altered blood chemistry and specific behavioural modifications. 2. Morphometric measurements of Steller sea lions through the 1970s and 1980s in Alaska indicate reduced body size. Reduced numbers of pups born and an apparent increase in juvenile mortality rates also appear to be nutritionally based. Blood chemistry analyses have further shown that Steller sea lions in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands area exhibited signs of an acute phase reaction, or immune reaction, in response to unidentified physical and/or environmental stress. Behavioural studies during the 1990s have not noted any changes that are indicative of an overall shortage in the quantity of prey available to lactating female sea lions. 3. The data collected in Alaska are consistent with the hypothesis that Steller sea lions in the declining regions were nutritionally compromised because of the relative quality of prey available to them (chronic nutritional stress), rather than because of the overall quantity of fish per se (acute nutritional stress). This is further supported by captive studies that indicate the overall quality of prey that has been available to Steller sea lions in the declining population could compromise the health of Steller sea lions and hinder their recovery."
1416,1541,Possible decline in leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea nesting along the coast of Caribbean Central America,"Leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea nesting has declined on Pacific beaches and as a result the species is considered Critically Endangered. Atlantic populations are, however, also important for the species' survival and therefore we undertook a study to quantify the size and nesting trend of the Caribbean Costa Rica and Panama leatherback turtle rookery. Tag returns show that post-nesting females from the rookery disperse throughout the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic. Aerial and track survey results were used to estimate 5,759-12,893 nests per year between San Juan river and Chiriquí beach, making this the fourth largest rookery worldwide. Monitoring results from three beaches (Tortuguero, Pacuare and Gandoca) were used to examine any temporal trend in nesting using nonparametric regression. Nesting appeared to decline slightly from 1995 to 2003 but the trend could be an artefact of interannual variation in nest numbers. Explanations for the difference in nesting trends over the past 15 years for Pacific (rapid decline) and Caribbean (slight decline or stable) rookeries include: (1) hatching success on Caribbean beaches has been higher due to dispersed nesting, (2) fisheries bycatch has been greater in the Pacific, and (3) less overlap between fishing areas and leatherback turtle habitats in the Atlantic. Quantification of human-caused mortality of all life stages and knowledge of the marine habitats used by Atlantic leatherback turtles are required to facilitate the development and implementation of effective strategies to reduce threats and avoid a repeat of the decline that has occurred in the Pacific population. "
1417,2956,"Leatherback Turtle Nesting Trends and Threats at Tortuguero, Costa Rica","Leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) nesting activity was monitored, individual movements via flipper tag recoveries and satellite telemetry were determined, and illegal egg collection was quantified at Tortuguero, Costa Rica from 1995 to 2006. Annual nest deposition was estimated at 199-1,623 nests per year; a Bayesian regression model suggests that leatherback nesting decreased by 67.8% between 1995 and 2006. Tag recaptures from fisheries bycatch and strandings have been reported from Cuba, Nicaragua, and the United States. Two leatherbacks were followed with satellite telemetry; 1 swam to Cuba and 1 moved into the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Minimum rates for illegal egg collection from 2000 to 2005 were estimated at 13.0%-21.5%. "
1418,674,"Long-term conservation efforts contribute to positive green turtle Chelonia mydas nesting trend at Tortuguero, Costa Rica","Worldwide, green turtle Chelonia mydas populations have declined and the species is classified as globally endangered. Tortuguero, Costa Rica, hosts the largest remaining green turtle rookery in the Atlantic basin. Tortuguero green turtles have been hunted since pre-Columbian times. Monitoring and conservation of the green turtle population began in 1955. The long-term efforts provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate the success of sea turtle conservation action and policies. Nest counts conducted 1971-2003 were analyzed to: (1) determine the nesting trend, (2) estimate rookery size and (3) identify events and policy decisions influencing the trend. A nonparametric regression model indicates a 417% increase in nesting over the study period. Rookery size was defined as the mean number of nests 1999-2003 and estimated at 104,411 nestsyear-1, corresponding to 17,402-37,290 nesting femalesyear-1. A comparison with 34 index populations verifies Tortuguero as one of the two largest green turtle rookeries worldwide. Events and policy decisions in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama that comprise the main nesting, feeding and mating grounds for the Tortuguero population are likely to have had the greatest influence on green turtle survivorship. Conservation efforts and policies catalyzing increased hatchling production and decreased adult and juvenile mortality since 1963 have contributed to the positive nesting trend. The trend demonstrates that long-term conservation efforts can reverse nesting declines and offers hope that adequate management can result in recuperation of endangered sea turtle species. "
1419,2496,The relationship between population means and variances of reproductive success differs between local populations of white stork (Ciconia ciconia),"We studied the size and productivity of white stork (Ciconia ciconia) populations in eight study sites in Poland. The number of nesting pairs and the average number of chicks fledged per pair fluctuated over time, and the studied populations differed in the variance of both breeding success and number of breeding pairs. The variance of breeding success (both for the mean number of chicks and the proportion of successful nests) and the variance of the number of breeding pairs was not correlated with the extent of stable habitats (pastures, meadows, wetlands), other habitats (farmland), or with local population trends over time. We found a nonlinear symmetrical relationship between annual mean reproductive success and its variance but only when considered as the proportion of successful nests (i.e., when individual nests are coded as a binary value: 0, no success; 1, success). No such relationship existed when success was expressed as the number of fledged chicks. Although a positive significant correlation occurred between fledgling numbers (discrete data) and the proportion of successful nests (binary data), we believe that the use of only binary data will be inadequate in more detailed analyses, such as population viability analysis."
1420,4456,"Development and testing of a Bayesian population model for the bigeye thresher shark, Alopias superciliosus, in an area subset of the western North Pacific","A Bayesian population modelling tool integrating separable virtual population analysis, per-recruit models and age-structured demographic analysis was developed for the bigeye thresher Alopias superciliosus (Lowe) population in an area subset of the western North Pacific. The mortality rates for years 19892016 were estimated, various biological reference points and associated risks of decline were also estimated, and alternative harvest strategies for the stock were evaluated. Estimates of the posterior mean of fishing mortality for bigeye thresher shark suggest fishing pressure has been high in recent years (20112016). The estimated population growth rate (?) (without fishing) obtained from age-structured demographic model was relatively low (? = 1.01 per year; 95% confidence intervals of 1.00 and 1.03 per year). Risk analyses revealed that only low levels of fishing pressure (10% of the current fishing pressure) over a wide range of ages could maintain a relatively low risk of population decline for bigeye threshers. Sensitivity testing indicated that the model is robust to prior specification. The developed framework could be used as an assessment tool to evaluate the risk of decline for other widely distributed pelagic shark species where insufficient catch and effort data are available."
1421,3599,Distribution of relatively rare demersal elasmobranchs in the eastern Mediterranean,"A time series of data for the demersal elasmobranchs Mustelus mustelus, Raja asterias, Torpedo marmorata and Galeus melastomus obtained from the "" MEDITS"" experimental surveys carried out in the Aegean Sea from 1998 to 2008 were examined to identify depth preferences, together with the spatial and temporal distribution pattern of the species. Survey data have been modelled by means of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), as functions of depth, sampling position (latitude-longitude interaction) and year. Both depth and geographical coordinates were the key determinants of the presence of all species, while annual abundance fluctuations were found to be either insignificant or without any specific trend. The depth distribution patterns differed between species. M. mustelus, and T. marmorata, were more frequent in continental shelf areas (up to 180-200 m). R. asterias preferred the transitional depth zone between shelf and slope (around 200 m), while depths over 350 m (continental slope) favoured the presence of G. melastomus. Model predictions were used to generate density distributions maps, which could facilitate conservation plans in the area through the identification of abundance hotspots. "
1422,3837,Long-Term Monitoring of Dzanga Bai Forest Elephants: Forest Clearing Use Patterns,"Individual identification of the relatively cryptic forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) at forest clearings currently provides the highest quality monitoring data on this ecologically important but increasingly threatened species. Here we present baseline data from the first 20 years of an individually based study of this species, conducted at the Dzanga Clearing, Central African Republic. A total of 3,128 elephants were identified over the 20-year study (1,244 adults; 675 females, 569 males). It took approximately four years for the majority of elephants visiting the clearing to be identified, but new elephants entered the clearing every year of the study. The study population was relatively stable, varying from 1,668 to 1,864 individuals (including juveniles and infants), with increasingly fewer males than females over time. The age-class distribution for females remained qualitatively unchanged between 1995 and 2010, while the proportion of adult males decreased from 20% to 10%, likely reflecting increased mortality. Visitation patterns by individuals were highly variable, with some elephants visiting monthly while others were ephemeral users with visits separated by multiple years. The number of individuals in the clearing at any time varied between 40 and 100 individuals, and there was little evidence of a seasonal pattern in this variation. The number of elephants entering the clearing together (defined here as a social group) averaged 1.49 (range 112) for males and 2.67 (range 114) for females. This collation of 20 years of intensive forest elephant monitoring provides the first detailed, long term look at the ecology of bai visitation for this species, offering insight to the ecological significance and motivation for bai use, social behavior, and threats to forest elephants. We discuss likely drivers (rainfall, compression, illegal killing, etc.) influencing bai visitation rates. This study provides the baseline for future demographic and behavioral studies of this population."
1423,4302,Conservation status of chimpanzees Pan troglodytes verus and other large mammals in Liberia: a nationwide survey,"Liberia has the largest blocks of continuous forest in West Africa, providing habitat for numerous wildlife species. However, there is a lack of empirical data about the status of Liberia's wildlife populations. During 20102012 we conducted the first nationwide survey in Liberia along c. 320 km of systematically located transect lines to estimate the abundance of chimpanzees Pan troglodytes verus, the diversity of large mammals and the nature and degree of anthropogenic threats. With &gt; 7,000 chimpanzees, Liberia is home to the second largest population of West African chimpanzees and is therefore a priority for conservation of the species. Compared to the fragmented populations in other range countries the Liberian population is potentially one of the most viable. Our study revealed that the majority of chimpanzees and some of the most species-diverse mammal communities in Liberia exist outside protected areas. High hunting rates and plans for large-scale exploitation of natural resources necessitate rapid implementation of effective strategies to ensure the protection of one of West Africa's last strongholds for chimpanzees and other rare and threatened mammal species. We provide a country-wide baseline dataset that may serve as a platform for Liberian wildlife authorities, policy-makers and international conservation agencies to make informed decisions about the location and delineation of proposed protected areas, to identify conservation gaps and to devise a conservation action plan to conserve Liberia's wildlife resources."
1424,93,Reedbed Management and Breeding Bitterns Botaurus stellaris in the UK.,A survey of habitats at 17 reedbed sites in the UK which currently hold or have recently held breeding bitterns Botaurus stellaris has shown significant differences between sites with decreasing and sites with increasing numbers of birds over the period 1979 to 1994. Those sites where bitterns have declined had significantly higher values for variables describing scrub encroachment and the presence of wet herb species than those where the bitterns have increased. A model describing bittern numbers in 1990 at the 17 sites included reed area and a measure of scrub encroachment as the significant predictive variables. It is concluded that hydroseral succession has been a key factor in the recent decline in breeding bitterns in the UK.
1425,4567,Effectiveness of deepwater marine protected areas: Implication for Okinawan demersal fisheries management,"Deepwater snappers (Lutjanidae) support important commercial demersal fisheries in Okinawa and throughout much of the Indo-Pacific region. However, recent evidence suggests that over-exploitation has substantially reduced stock biomass throughout these regions. Deepwater marine protected areas (MPAs) are often established as a conservation and management tool, but there are few published studies on their efficacy. This study examined the effectiveness of a deepwater MPA in the Kita-Taikyu Bank (KB), based on the changes in relative abundance and size-frequency distributions for target species collected over seven years between a five-year period of year-round closure and subsequent seasonal closures. Etelis coruscans was the most abundant lutjanid in the KB, comprising 45.0% of the total number of individual deepwater snappers. The relative abundance of E. coruscans in the deepwater MPA was influenced by whether protection was year-round or seasonal; their abundance decreased significantly when the ban was lifted. Some distinct size modes of E. coruscans gradually grew larger during the year-round closure, but modes were indistinct after the change to seasonal closures. In addition, our results showed that the relative abundance of mature size classes had not fully recovered during the study period. In our tagging experiment for 151 deepwater snappers comprised of six species, two tagged Pristipomoides filamentosus were recaptured. These cases supplied some biological data regarding deepwater snappers: the periodicity of the growth zone formation and the low rate of cross-border movement of Pr. filamentosus. Our study suggested that deepwater snappers are rapidly depleted by fishing and very slow to recover. It also provided evidence of the potential success of MPAs for deepwater snappers; longer-term year-round closure of deepwater MPAs may be the best solution for affording long-lived fishery species the protection necessary for them to achieve maturity."
1426,4027,Floods and famine: climate-induced collapse of a tropical predator-prey community,"Will climate change threaten wildlife populations by gradual shifts in mean conditions, or by increased frequency of extreme weather events? Based on long-term data (from 1991 to 2014), the aim of the present study was to analyse and compare the sensitivity of predator-prey demography to extreme climatic events versus normal, albeit highly variable, annual deviations in climatic conditions in the Australian wet-dry tropics. From 1991 to 2005, predators (water pythons, Liasis fuscus) and their main prey (dusky rats, Rattus colletti) showed significant climate-driven fluctuations in numbers. These fluctuations were, however, trivial compared to the impact of two massive but brief deluges in 2007 and 2011, which virtually eliminated the dusky rats. The two floods resulted in the pythons experiencing an unprecedented famine in seven out of the last 8 years causing a massive shift in python demography, that is a significant reduction in feeding rates, reproductive output, growth rates, relative body mass, survival, mean body length and numbers (from 3173 in 1992 to 96 in 2013). Our results demonstrate that attempts to predict faunal responses to climate change, even if based on long-term studies, may be doomed to failure. Consequently, biologists may need to confront the uncomfortable truth that increased frequency of brief unpredictable bouts of extreme weather can influence populations far more than gradual deviations in mean climatic conditions."
1427,3644,"Population demography of frillneck lizards (Chlamydosaurus kingii, Gray 1825) in the wet-dry tropics of Australia","We explore the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the population demography of frillneck lizards (Chlamydosaurus kingii) in the Australian wet-dry tropics. Annual growth rates of males were significantly higher across all body sizes compared to females, resulting in a significant larger maximum body size in males. Both male and female lizards were highly philopatric and 81% of the among-year recapture distances were less than 200m. Juvenile and adult frillnecks were subjected to low but highly variable annual survival rates. Both proportion of juveniles and relative proportion of reproductive females showed extensive among-year variations. No relationship was, however, observed between proportion of gravid females and that of juveniles captured during the subsequent year. High rainfall in January was negatively correlated with recruitment most likely caused by increased egg/embryo mortality due to flooding of nest sites. We therefore suggest that the lack of association between female reproduction and juvenile recruitment was due to the effects of stochastic variation in January rainfall. Lizard numbers increased during the first five years of the study followed by a decline during the subsequent four years. Our analyses show that annual variation in survival constituted the main determinant in driving the annual change in frillneck numbers. Surprisingly, no relationship was observed between fillneck population dynamics and annual variation in juvenile recruitment. We suggest that the 7-years over which these analyses were conducted were insufficient to detect any significant effects of recruitment on lizard numbers, demonstrating the need for long-term studies to accurately document vertebrate population demographic processes in areas experiencing stochastic variations rainfall such as the Australian wet-dry tropics."
1428,2801,"Detecting the impact of invasive species on native fauna: cane toads (Bufo marinus), frillneck lizards (Chlamydosaurus kingii) and the importance of spatial replication","An understanding of which native species are severely impacted by an anthropogenic change (such as the arrival of an invasive species) and which are not is critical to prioritizing conservation efforts. However, it is difficult to detect such impacts if the native taxa exhibit strong stochastic variations in abundance; a 'natural' population decline might be wrongly interpreted as an impact of the invader. Frillneck lizards (Chlamydosaurus kingii) are large iconic Australian agamids, and have been reported to decline following the invasion of toxic cane toads. We monitored three populations of the species in the savanna woodland of tropical Australia over a 7-year period bracketing toad arrival. One population crashed, one remained stable and one increased. Hence, studies on any single population might have inferred that cane toads have negative, negligible or positive effects on frillneck lizards. With the benefit of spatial replication, and in combination with observations of prey choice by captive lizards, our data suggest that invasive cane toads have had little or no effect on frillneck abundance."
1429,2341,"Regionally coherent trends in colonies of African penguins Spheniscus demersus in the Western Cape, South Africa, 1987–2005","From 1987 to 2005, numbers of African penguins Spheniscus demersus breeding in South Africa's Western Cape Province increased by about 50%. Numbers decreased at the four northernmost colonies in the region: Lambert's Bay and the three colonies in Saldanha Bay, although at Jutten Island the decrease is inferred from an estimate for 1987, derived from interpolation. Numbers also decreased at Geyser Rock and Dyer Island on the South Coast. At five colonies between Saldanha Bay and Dyer Island there were large increases. At a sixth colony in that region, Seal Island, where Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus limit breeding space, numbers remained stable. At two colonies that were initiated in the early 1980s, Robben Island and Boulders, increases were initially rapid (>20% per annum) and matched growth of the South African stock of sardine Sardinops sagax. Strong growth at Dassen and Vondeling islands, between Robben Island and Saldanha Bay, was observed from about 1996-2002, when there was a large increase in the biomass of pelagic fish off South Africa. Increases at colonies between Saldanha Bay and Boulders slowed after 2002, whereas the colony at Dyer Island stabilised at that time. In 2003, a new colony was initiated east of Dyer Island at De Hoop Nature Reserve. These latter trends followed an eastward shift in the distribution of sardine. Small penguin colonies may act as foci for growth in a period when the distribution of prey is changing. Hence, it is important that they be maintained, especially those that, if lost, would increase the isolation of regional populations. Some of the small colonies are less susceptible to oil spills than colonies in the proximity of harbours, and for that reason also are important. "
1430,2103,"Population size of humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, in waters off the Pacific coast of Mexico","The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is a cosmopolitan species whose stocks were drastically decreased by commercial whaling practices prior to 1967. The North Pacific population was estimated to be between 15,000 and 20,000 animals before the practice of whaling. At the time of the commencement of its international protection in 1967, this population may have been reduced to fewer than 1000 individuals. The Pacific coast of Mexico and the Revillagigedo Archipelago constitute one of the main breeding and calving areas for North Pacific humpback whales. The objective of this paper is to present an estimation of abundance of humpback whales in this region based on photographic identification of individual animals. Estimates of population size were obtained by using mark and recapture models for both closed and open populations, with each year representing a capture occasion. A total of 1184 humpback whales were identified in Mexican waters between 1986 and 1993. The best estimates of population size for the Mexican stocks were those provided by the modified Jolly-Seber method: 1813 (95% CI: 918-2505) for the coastal stock in 1992, and 914 (95% CI: 590-1193) for the Revillagigedo stock in 1991."

1432,4047,"Age and Population Size Estimates of Overwintering Shortnose Sturgeon in the Saint John River, New Brunswick, Canada","The densities and overall abundances of overwintering shortnose sturgeon Acipenser brevirostrum were estimated using underwater video at the Kennebecasis River overwintering site in 2009 and 2011. In 2009, underwater cameras coupled with lasers provided image-based estimates of fish lengths (and therefore ages). The precision and accuracy of laser-based measurements were estimated by laboratory experiments. In total, 362 and 222 overwintering shortnose sturgeon were counted in the 0.02-km2 area during 2009 and 2011, respectively. The fork lengths of 83 overwintering shortnose sturgeon measured in 2009 ranged from 54 to 119 cm, corresponding to ages of 11?57 years (20.3 ± 7.9 years [mean ± SD]). Length measurement accuracy was highest (±10% fork length) when fish were positioned at 0 ± 30° or 180 ± 30° to the camera's lens. Three different models of spatial fish density estimated a total of 3,852?5,222 shortnose sturgeon in 2009 and 2011, similar to the 2005 local population estimate of 4,836 shortnose sturgeon. The consistent, high-density aggregation of subadults and adults at this small site between 2005 and 2011 suggests that the site is important for protection of shortnose sturgeon in the Saint John River system.

1433,1896,Fluctuations in abundance of large herbivore populations: insights into the influence of dry season rainfall and elephant numbers from long-term data,"In some African protected areas, elephant populations have reached high densities causing concern about their influence on other forms of biodiversity, and in particular, other large herbivores. This has led to a debate whether management of elephant populations might need to be implemented. Surprisingly, few studies have focused on the influence of elephants on other herbivores and the existing results are conflicting. We investigated such influence in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, where elephants were culled and maintained at low density up to 1986, and have more than doubled since then, thus providing the opportunity to explore their possible influence on other herbivore species. Trends of different herbivore populations were obtained using long-term waterhole census data, with these results also being correlated to changes in dry season rainfall, as another fundamental determinant of herbivore population fluctuations. While our study did not allow us to properly disentangle the role of elephants and rainfall, it provided valuable insights. For five out of the 13 herbivore species studied, the population increased between 1973 and 1986 (high dry season rainfall; relatively low elephant abundance), then decreased between 1987 and 1995 (extremely low dry season rainfall; increase in the elephant population), and finally have increased since 1996 (high dry season rainfall; high elephant abundance). These results are consistent with an important role of dry season rainfall on herbivore population dynamics. Additionally, for four other species, the population increased between 1973 and 1986 and has decreased since then. As most herbivore declines occurred simultaneously with increase in the elephant population in the 1987-1995 period, and with the recent increase in most populations happening at a lower rate than the 1973-1985 period, our results suggest the possible existence of a negative influence of high elephant densities on other herbivores. We discuss what the possible underlying mechanisms can be and how to investigate them. "
1434,3591,Effects of a marine protected area on fish assemblage associated with Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds: temporal and depth variations,"This study describes the changes in the structure of the fish assemblage associated with Posidonia oceanica meadows after the establishment of a marine protected area. The survey of the ichthyofauna in the Marine Reserve of Tabarca Island was carried out by visual censuses with SCUBA. Inside and outside the reserve was sampled six times at random from summer 1997 to summer 1999 and in three different depths (1, 5 and 15 m) by applying transects of 150 · 5 m over the P. oceanica meadows. The data were analyzed with multivariant methodologies and with analysis of variance. The most represented families in number of species were the sparids and labrids. Mean abundance, biomass and number of species were higher inside the reserve in all studied periods. Inside the marine protected area, these variables decreased as depth increased; outside the protected area the pattern was the opposite, reaching the maximum at 15 m."
1435,1188,Abundance and distribution of the South American Altiplano flamingos,"The James Flamingo (Phoenicopterus jamesi), the Andean Flamingo (P. andinus), and part of the Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis) population occur in the High Andes of Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and Peru. Until January 1997, the altiplano population and distribution of the James and Andean Flamingos was unknown, except for very crude estimates made in 1977. We performed simultaneous censuses (by car) with the participation of Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and Peru. In January 1997, we censused 100 lakes and counted 47,619 James Flamingos and 33,927 Andean Flamingos. In January 1998, we censused 133 lakes and counted 63,143 James Flamingos and 25,643 Andean Flamingos. In August, the wintering season for these species, we counted 31,657 James Flamingos and 13,944 Andean Flamingos in the same region. During the summer months (January-March), the James Flamingo was concentrated mainly in Bolivia and Argentina, whereas the Andean Flamingo was concentrated in Chile and Bolivia. During the winter months (June-September), the James Flamingos was found in Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia, while the Andean Flamingos were principally in Chile and Peru."
1436,2024,"Decline of the olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) nesting assemblage at Nancite Beach, Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica","The olive ridley sea turtle nesting colony at Nancite beach, Costa Rica, was monitored since 1980. Estimates of numbers of nests oviposited throughout the term of the study were obtained by empirical sampling of the mass nesting assemblages (arribadas) occurring during the peak nesting months of August through November for 15 years. The method to obtain these estimates is described and discussed. The number of nests laid during each arribada averaged 37,960 and varied in size from 148,000 nests in October 1980 to 350 nests in August 1993. Data showed a steady decline in the number of nests laid and in frequency of occurrence of arribada events at Nancite beach. There was a sharp decline during 1983 and consecutive poor nesting periods during 1987-96. Whereas nesting during any one year may be affected by environmental factors such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation events, we suggest that low hatching rates recorded at this beach may play a significant role in determining the long-term decline of the nesting effort of the Nancite assemblage."
1437,3592,"Rapid changes in growth, condition, size and age of small pelagic fish in the Mediterranean","Since 2007, the ecosystem of the Gulf of Lions has shifted to a different regime, characterised by a low anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) biomass and a remarkably high sprat (Sprattus sprattus) biomass. Surprisingly, the abundance and recruitment of anchovy and sardine remained high. To understand which processes (bottom-up or top-down control, etc.) could have caused this shift, we studied the changes in body condition, growth and size and age of anchovy, sardine and sprat over 1984–1985 and 1992–2012, using data from scientific surveys. The annual age structure of anchovy and sardine was estimated using Bayesian mixture models based on size frequency data with priors on the age–length relationship derived from independent otolith readings. The results indicated periods during which anchovy and sardine were in an average (1992–2004), good (2005–2007) or poor (2008–2012) overall state of condition. For sardine, the shift towards smaller fish observed during these past 4 years was explained by a combination of slower growth and the disappearance of older individuals (ages 2+). Despite the increase in biomass of sprat since 2008, indications were found that sprat was also smaller than in the past. As growth and condition decreased and overexploitation has not been documented or suspected for those three species in this area, we propose that the current decline in sardine and anchovy biomass could be due to qualitative and/or quantitative modifications in the planktonic production (i.e. a bottom-up control) or mass mortalities of adults due to an epidemic disease."
1438,3622,Interactions between native and non-native cichlid species in a Costa Rican river,"The convict cichlid, Amatitlania siquia, is a serially monogamous, bi-parental cichlid species native to Costa Rican rivers. Numerous field studies conducted in the Rio Cabuyo (Lomas Barbudal, Costa Rica) have provided a wealth of information regarding the behavioral ecology of this species. Recently a cichlid species that was previously not found in the Rio Cabuyo was identified as Hypsophrys nematopus. This influx of this non-native species provides an interesting ability to study the interactions of this potentially invasive species and to monitor the changes made by the native cichlid species. Over the course of several field seasons, I investigated the interactions between the native convict cichlid and the non-native cichlid. I surveyed the distribution of breeding pairs of both species and conducted behavioral tests to examine the interactions between the native and non-native species. I found an overall decline breeding pairs of both species over the course of the study. I found that both species were more aggressive to conspecific intruders and that female convict cichlids were aggressive to juveniles but males were not. These results provide important information concerning how native species interact with non-native species. It appears that the A. siquia population may experience a change in its reproductive behaviors due to the influx of H. nematopus."
1439,2083,Mass occurrence of snake pipefish in the Northeast Atlantic: result of a change in climate?,"In 2004, a sudden mass occurrence of snake pipefish Entelurus aequoreus took place in the Northeastern Atlantic and the abundance has been increasing since. Before 2004, snake pipefish were mainly found in coastal areas and have been reported only occasionally in oceanic waters. The oceanic form lives free in the water column while the coastal form is found among sea weeds or in sea grass beds. Abundance indices (numbers per hour fishing) from inshore surveys have remained at the same level, while those from offshore surveys show a very strong increase since 2004. The length distributions differ significantly between surveys, with coastal snake pipefishes being larger. Although the outward appearance of the coastal pipefishes seems different from the pelagic specimens, no differences were found when comparing taxonomic features. Apart from appearance the habitat is different for the two types of snake pipefish. The oceanic specimens of snake pipefish are much leaner than the coastal specimens. Stomach contents of the oceanic snake pipefishes revealed remains of relatively small calanoids (mean length 2.4 mm). The calanoid population has recently changed and is nowadays dominated by the smaller Calanus helgolandicus. Here we put forward the hypothesis that the sudden appearance of the snake pipefish in the deeper waters is a result of the change in the average lengths of calanoids which in firm is caused by changes in the hydroclimatic environment. The mass occurrence of the snake pipefish is affecting the ecosystem. Seabirds are feeding their chicks with them and they are also found in stomachs of fish and sea mammals. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

1441,2524,Wintering White-Tailed Eagles Haliaeetus albicilla in the Netherlands: Aspects of Habitat Scale and Quality,"The coastal wetlands of The Netherlands have always served as winter haunts for juvenile and immature White-tailed Eagles from breeding populations further north and east. Even as these populations were at their lowest ebb by the 1960s and 1970s, each winter a few individuals showed up, invariably favouring large wetlands with a good supply of wintering, mainly herbivorous, waterfowl. An analysis of the presence of eagles in the wetland Oostvaardersplassen showed that wintering numbers as well as the duration of individual stays increased as a function of the number and biomass of waterbirds present. During the pioneering stage of this newly reclaimed area the dynamic vegetation produced huge seed supplies that attracted vast numbers of herbivorous waterbirds. The increase in eagle numbers in the Oostvaardersplassen reserve preceded the recovery of the northern and eastern breeding populations of Whitetailed Eagles, but did not increase any further after reaching a maximum of 3-4 wintering birds, despite the fact that wintering numbers elsewhere in The Netherlands continued to rise in the wake of the increasing breeding population elsewhere in Europe. It is argued that 'core area' Oostvaardersplassen became saturated each winter in the 2000s. Additional eagles reaching The Netherlands spent the winter at alternative sites with smaller food supplies. In 1997-99, new waterbodies were created in the dry border zone of Oostvaardersplassen. The subsequent boost in waterbirds and fish may have triggered - in combination with the presence of undisturbed breeding habitat - the summering, and eventual breeding, of White-tailed Eagles from 2004 onwards. Water management towards improving dynamics in larger wetlands (both estuarine and riverine) jnay further boost food supplies for waterfowl and, hence, create suitable habitat for White-tailed Eagles elsewhere in The Netherlands."
1442,5,Indexing European bird population trends using results of national monitoring schemes: a trial of a new method.,"Many European countries have annual breeding bird monitoring schemes based on nationwide samples; most are in northern and western Europe. We have developed a method to produce yearly population indices of bird species across countries by combining the results of existing national schemes. The method takes into account the differences in population sizes per country, as well as the differences in field methods, and the numbers of sites and years covered by the national schemes. In order to test the method, we collected raw data from a number of countries and applied an index method to produce scheme results per country. Data were collected for five farmland species (Lapwing Vanellus vanellus, Linnet Carduelis cannabina, Skylark Alauda arvensis, Whitethroat Sylvia communis and Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella), from seven countries (UK, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Latvia and Estonia) for a 20-year period (1978-97). The trial demonstrated that it was possible to combine national indices to provide supra-national yearly totals and their standard errors; the results were similar to those produced when the raw data were used. Thus, yearly European indices can be produced by exchanging only limited amounts of information, that is the national yearly indices of each species or, preferably, the yearly population numbers and their standard errors. At a European scale, the populations of the five species selected have changed considerably. In western Europe (UK, Netherlands, Denmark and former West Germany combined), Linnet, Skylark and Yellowhammer have declined and Whitethroat has increased. Most changes occurred during the first ten-year period (1978-88). The changes in eastern Europe (the remaining countries) were less clear, in part because the statistical power of the national schemes is as yet limited. "
1443,3925,Habitat use and status of the Bokikokiko or Christmas Island Warbler (Acrocephalus aequinoctialis),"The Bokikokiko or Christmas Island Warbler (Acrocephalus aequinoctialis); is found only on Kiritimati (Christmas) and Teraina ( Washington) Islands; in the Republic of Kiribati. The population on Kiritimati Island is threatened by; habitat degradation, sea level rise, and predation from feral cats (Felis catus), Pacific; rats (Rattus exulans), and recently arrived black rats (Rattus rattus). There is; scant information about distribution and abundance of the Bokikokiko. From; 2007 to 2012, we conducted surveys with song playbacks at 83 points on 12 transects; in the northern half of Kiritimati Island to measure abundance of the; Bokikokiko and begin monitoring for possible declines associated with the; spread of rats, and we collected habitat data to investigate factors that influenced; Bokikokiko abundance. Song playbacks resulted in a 263% increase in detection; rate over passive listening. We detected an average (±1 SE) of 0.63 ± 0.11 birds; per point using playbacks. Average population density was 0.36 ± 0.06 birds per; hectare, but abundance varied among regions, and no birds were detected in; some areas with apparently suitable habitat. Range of the Bokikokiko encompassed; an area of 14,180 ha but was fragmented by many lagoons and bare; ground, and only about half that area was actually occupied. Estimated population; size was 2,550 ± 425 birds. Bokikokiko were more abundant in areas with; taller Heliotropium trees and taller Scaevola shrubs, and less abundant in areas; with more Suriana shrubs, bare ground, and grass. Conservation actions needed; for the Bokikokiko include ongoing removal of rats from islets within the lagoons; of Kiritimati Island, protection of preferred habitat from development; and fires, and translocations to create additional populations on rat-free atolls."
1444,4128,"Juvenile survival, recruitment, population size, and effects of avian pox virus in Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) on Oahu, Hawaii, USA","Understanding population dynamics and determining conservation priorities in long-lived species with delayed; breeding often is hampered by lack of information about younger age classes. Obtaining accurate estimates of; juvenile survival and recruitment can be difficult because young individuals are infrequently observed. We used mark; recapture models to estimate age-specific survival, recruitment, population size, and encounter probability of Laysan; Albatrosses (Phoebastria immutabilis) using a 14-yr dataset from Oahu, Hawaii, USA. We also measured the long-term; effect of avian pox virus (Poxvirus avium) on the survival and recruitment of albatrosses infected as nestlings. Survival; of juvenile albatrosses during the first year after fledging was 0.757 6 0.042. We were able to estimate juvenile; survival, the first such estimate in any long-lived seabird, because our high search effort revealed that some birds; began visiting the natal colony at the age of 1 yr. The survival of prebreeders increased rapidly and reached a value in; the second year (0.973 6 0.008) that was similar to the survival of breeding adults (0.973 6 0.017). The average age of; first return to the natal colony was 4.24 6 0.11 yr. The average age at first breeding was 8.44 6 0.15 yr, with; recruitment probability peaking at ages 910 yr and a single bird being recruited into the breeding population at the; age of 4 yr. Pox virus decreased survival in the first year by 4%13% and decreased recruitment probability up to age; 12 by 4%26%, depending on the severity of infection. The total size of the Laysan Albatross population on Oahu in; 2015 was 555 birds, consisting of 270 active breeders, 231 prebreeders, and 54 birds that likely skipped breeding that; year. The number of prebreeders constituted an average of 44% of the total population. These demographic estimates; will be useful for population modeling exercises involving various threat and management scenarios, and for; examining environmental factors that influence demography."
1445,1886,Effects of climate variation on the abundance and distribution of flamingos in the Galapagos Islands,"El Nino Southern Oscillation events have been associated with large fluctuations in seabird and landbird populations of the Galapagos Islands. We reveal different effects of climatic variation on the abundance and distribution of a waterbird, as illustrated by the flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber living in saline coastal lagoons of the arid Galapagos environment. Using time series analyses (autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)) to model the temporal variations in abundance, we found significant correlations between rainfall, lagoon water level (LWL), lagoon temperature and flamingo abundance. Although these variables were good predictors of flamingo abundance, they explained <50% of the variance in monthly counts. During the strong El Nino event of 1982[long dash]1983, extreme rainfall resulted in an increase in LWLs (>300 mm above the long-term mean) and a record decline in flamingo numbers. Monthly abundance of flamingos was lower, on average, during the rainy season (between January and May) when LWLs were above their seasonal mean. Flamingo abundance at the two lagoons on Isabela Island and those at 'all other lagoons' in the Archipelago showed a significant negative correlation. We infer that moderate reductions in the abundance of flamingos in the rainy season and significant temporary declines during El Nino events are explained by movements between lagoons within the Archipelago rather than by mortality. This illustrates the general principle that climate change may, without directly affecting population sizes, prompt adaptive behavioural changes with the potential to affect population biology."
1446,1173,Population size and trends of the Galapagos Penguin Spheniscus mendiculus.,"We applied a capture-mark-resight (CMR) method to estimate the population size of the Galápagos Penguin Spheniscus mendiculus. In 1999, we estimated 1198 individuals, with lower and upper 95% confidence limits of 1054 and 1403 individuals, respectively, and estimated that approximately 57% of the total population was counted in an annual census. Applying this estimate to the 2003 census, we estimated that the population size for the whole archipelago was 1351 individuals. We also applied the correction factor derived from the 1999 CMR data to other censuses carried out between 1970 and 2003 and estimated a maximum population of about 4000 individuals in 1971 when the highest numbers of Penguins were counted. Although the Penguin population size has fluctuated in the last 33 years, the overall trend shows larger populations in 1970-80 followed by relatively smaller populations and a slow recovery rate in 1983-2003. The data set also shows two major population declines (in 1983 and 1998), which are coincident with El Niño episodes. "
1447,1876,Status of white croaker Micropogonias furnieri exploited in southern Brazil according to alternative hypotheses of stock discreetness,"The exploitation status of white croaker Micropogonias furnieri in southern Brazil is assessed using a production model constructed according to three hypotheses of stock discreetness: an isolated stock in southern Brazil; a straddling stock shared between Brazil and Uruguay; and a straddling stock shared among Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. Estimates of virgin stock size and maximum sustainable yield were more sensitive to the hypothesis assumed correct, the posterior means varying respectively from 177,648 to 1,007,256 tonnes and from 7459 to 38,677 tonnes. Estimates of stock status in relation to management reference points were more robust to the uncertainties in stock discreetness and indicate that the species in currently overfished (biomass at 60% of Bmsy) and under heavy overfishing (F between approximately 2 and 6 times higher than Fmsy). Results suggest that the relative stability of catches in the region occurs at the expense of a steady decline in stock abundance and that concerted management actions by the three countries are needed to bring the stock to safer levels of exploitation.

1448,3182,The Lesser white-fronted goose Anser erythropus in the south-east Caspian region of Turkmenistan,"The south-east Caspian region of Turkmenistan is an important; staging and wintering area for the globally threatened Lesser; White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus. During the period; 1975-2003, surveys carried out in late autumn and mid-winter; recorded Lesser White-fronted Geese at a total of 14 sites. The; numbers of geese fluctuated widely from a maximum of 1 850; individuals in November 1999 to none in several years. The most; important sites were the Turkmenbashi, Balkan, Mihkailovskiy; and Severo-Cheleken Bays in the central part of the Caspian; coast of Turkmenistan, and the delta of the Atrek River in the; southern part. Changes in the distribution and numbers of geese; have occurred as a result of habitat degradation or alteration and; other anthropogenic pressures, especially hunting. Various; measures are proposed for the protection and management of the; Lesser White-fronted Goose in Turkmenistan, and it is suggested; that these measures could be used in the development of an; international action plan for the conservation of the species in; the Caspian region as a whole."
1449,2575,Long-term effects of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on a lizard assemblage inhabiting coastal dunes in Argentina,"We studied abundance and habitat use in two species of Liolaemus (Squamata: Tropiduridae) at a coastal dune site in eastern Argentina before and 7 years after a road was built at the site. Before disturbance, lizards exhibited similar abundances and a wide segregation in microhabitat use. Liolaemus multimaculatus used flat dunes scarcely covered by Spartina ciliata, while Liolaemus gracilis used the grass Panicum racemosum as cover. After disturbance, the mean number of L. multimaculatus detected by month was significantly less than that observed in the predisturbance period, owing to a drastic reduction in S. ciliata microhabitat patches. The mean number of L. gracilis was similar to that seen during the first period. These differences were clearly linked to habitat loss at the site. We concluded that human impact on the habitat structure of foredunes induced changes in the structure of the lizard assemblage, including shifts in the relative abundance of species and the proportional use of their preferred microhabitats."
1450,4239,Monitoring and a population study of the common dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) in Flanders (Belgium),"In 2007 we started standardised monitoring of the Flemish common dormouse population, which is; limited to the eastern part of the municipality of Voeren, by a yearly nest count along 16 fixed transects; in autumn.

1451,2536,"Survival rate, abundance, and residency of long-finned pilot whales in the Strait of Gibraltar","Long-finned pilot whales in the Strait of Gibraltar are distributed over the main shipping routes. This exposes them to risks of collisions and probable acoustic and physical disturbance. This species is also the target of whale-watching operations. The aim of this study was to estimate the annual population size, survival rate, and population growth rate of pilot whales occurring in the Strait and their inter-annual variation using photo-identification. A robust design was used to estimate all three parameters. A total of 10,784 individual pilot whale fins were photographed and analyzed. The population size estimation in summer ranged from a low of 147 individuals in 1999 to a high of 265 individuals in 2003. The annual population growth rate was estimated from mark recapture models to be 5.5%. The survival rate of adults was estimated at 0.982 (95% CI: 0.955-0.993). The same individuals have been observed between years. This suggests that this population is resident in the Strait, at least during summer. This study provides baseline knowledge prior to a predicted increase in shipping traffic throughout the main foraging area due to the opening in 2007 of a major shipping harbor along the Moroccan coast of the Strait.

1452,2503,Economical versus ecological development: a case study of white storks in a cattle farm,"Aims: Wildlife and humans compete for natural resources generating conflicts that sometimes translate into financial loss. In this study, the economical costs of the upkeep of a white stork Ciconia ciconia colony at a cattle farm over a six-year period were evaluated. Furthermore, the effect of ash lopping in nest site selection and the efficacy of nest removal in controlling the population of this species was analysed. Location: The ash dehesa studied was located in the Northern area of the Madrid province, in both Soto del Real and Manzanares el Real localities (40° 44' N, 3° 49' E), from 1999 to 2004. Methods: Estimation was made of the economical cost of white stork colony maintenance by estimating the total weight of branches and bud shoots on the ashes. The tree type (lopped or unlopped) was noted to determine nest site selection where new nests were established in the subsequent year after lopping. Finally, it was recorded if removed nests (by the Regional Government as a method of population control) were less like to rebuilt in function of previous breeding success (failed or not). Results: Storks mainly selected lopped trees as nest sites. To avoid the increase of white stork pairs in the colony, lopping was not carried out in subsequent years, causing economical losses to landowners (a minimum of 13,902.33 € in six years). In addition, due to the high nest-site fidelity in this species, the total number of nests in the colony was not reduced by nest removal. Nests that contained a pair that failed in their reproductive attempt were less likely to be rebuilt in the consecutive breeding season. The results showed that selective nest removal (removal of nests which failed the previous year) might be a more effective method for population control than nest removal methods used to date. Conclusions: Due to the low total economic cost of colony maintenance, it is proposed that economical compensation by the regional government to the farm owners will be a more effective management measure than nest removal."
1453,3109,Fall distribution of pelagic birds over the shelf off SW Vancouver Island,"The distribution of pelagic birds was investigated over the continental shelf off southwestern; Vancouver Island in September and October of 1986 and 1987. The California Gull (Larus californicus) had; higher densities (average 61 birds/km) than all other birds combined and most gulls occurred in few but; relatively large flocks near fish trawlers over offshore banks and the outer continental shelf. California Gulls; were seen at more locations and in much smaller flocks in nearshore waters than further seaward. Glaucouswinged; Gulls (L. glaucescens), Cassin's Auklets (Ptychoramphusa leuticus) and Common Murres (Uria aalge) occurred; more in nearshore waters, while Sabine's Gulls (Xema sabini) and Sooty Shearwaters (Puffinus griseus); occurred mostly over the mid shelf. Pink-footed Shearwaters (P. creatopus) were generally observed to be; further from shore than were Sooty Shearwaters. Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) were most abundant; in the deepest waters (100-200 m) and Common Murres in the most shallow waters (<60 m). The distribution; of pelagic birds over the shelf is discussed in relation to that of their diet and the presence of trawlers."

1456,2079,Past and recent sperm whales sightings in the Azores based on catches and whale watching information,"The sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus, was the most captured great whale in the Azores Archipelago by land-based whaling and nowadays is the most appealing species for whale watching, one of the archipelago's principal sources of tourism. Our objective was to compare number of sightings during whaling and whale watching activities. Our main question to address the possible impact of past whaling in recent whale watching is: does a present-day eco-tourist sight more or fewer sperm whales than a whaler could sight in the past? For that, a compilation of data resulting both from past whaling records and recent whale watching records was conducted. We obtained a total of 727 independent sightings of sperm whales during a total of 280 different days of sperm whaling between 1947 and 1973. A total of 1767 sperm whale sightings were made during 1133 days of whale watching activities, between 1997 and 2008. The sperm whale sighting per unit of effort average was significantly higher in the past (35.68) than in the present (12.06). In the Azores, captures over the decades greatly decreased the number of sperm whales in the region and twenty years after the end of sperm whaling a reduced number of recent sightings were found. "

Despite valiant efforts to protect them, the forest guards are poorly equipped and no match for poachers armed with automatic weapons or those who make use of high-voltage power lines to electrocute the animals. The authors have discussed the many problems besetting rhino conservation in Assam with wildlife officials and they make several recommendations that would improve the situation. "
1458,4578,Within- and among-population variation in vital rates and population dynamics in a variable environment,"Understanding the causes of within- and among-population differences in vital rates, life histories, and population dynamics is a central topic in ecology. To understand how within- and among-population variation emerges, we need long-term studies that include episodic events and contrasting environmental conditions, data to characterize individual and shared variation, and statistical models that can tease apart shared and individual contribution to the observed variation. We used long-term tag-recapture data to investigate and estimate within- and among-population differences in vital rates, life histories, and population dynamics of marble trout Salmo marmoratus, an endemic freshwater salmonid with a narrow range. Only ten populations of pure marble trout persist in headwaters of Alpine rivers in western Slovenia. Marble trout populations are also threatened by floods and landslides, which have already caused the extinction of two populations in recent years. We estimated and determined causes of variation in growth, survival, and recruitment both within and among populations, and evaluated trade-offs between them. Specifically, we estimated the responses of these traits to variation in water temperature, density, sex, early life conditions, and extreme events. We found that the effects of population density on traits were mostly limited to the early stages of life and that growth trajectories were established early in life. We found no clear effects of water temperature on vital rates. Population density varied over time, with flash floods and debris flows causing massive mortalities (>55% decrease in survival with respect to years with no floods) and threatening population persistence. Apart from flood events, variation in population density within streams was largely determined by variation in recruitment, with survival of older fish being relatively constant over time within populations, but substantially different among populations. Marble trout show a fast to slow continuum of life histories, with slow growth associated with higher survival at the population level, possibly determined by food conditions and age at maturity. Our work provides unprecedented insight into the causes of variation in vital rates, life histories, and population dynamics in an endemic species that is teetering on the edge of extinction."
1459,1003,Population contraction of the white-backed woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos in Finland as a consequence of habitat alteration,"The population decline of the white-backed woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos in Finland is presented and factors affecting this decrease are analysed. The woodpecker favours mature, deciduous forests which include many dead trees. These forests have been clearcut and thinned heavily from the 1950s. Winter bird counts from the late 1950s to the 1980s show declines of over 90%. The size of the present population is estimated at 30-50 breeding pairs. Fledging success and adult survival rate are not exceptionally low compared to the results of other studies but juvenile mortality appears to be very high as the recruitment rate is low. The breeding population is also very sparse: the mean distance between nearest nests was 15 km. In order to preserve the white-backed woodpecker from extinction in Finland a network of deciduous forests favoured by the woodpecker has been proposed. "
1460,2171,"Ichthyofauna of the sub-tropical Nhlabane Estuary, KwaZulu-Natal: drought-related changes in the fish community during extended mouth closure","The fish fauna of the Nhlabane estuary in northern KwaZulu-Natal was studied during a drought over the period 1992-95. The estuary mouth closed in late 1991, due to the drought as well as water abstraction from the system, and only reopened when the drought ended in late 1995. Fish were sampled by seine and gill-netting. Of 40 species recorded, most were estuarine-dependent marine species. Marine and estuarine dependent species dominated during 1992, whereas freshwater and resident estuarine species dominated in 1995. Estuarine-dependent marine species declined most in number and abundance and were most affected by the low salinities and lack of marine influence due to the lack of post-larval recruitment and the loss of the nursery function of the estuary. Exploitation of the Nhlabane system as a water resource also contributed to the extended mouth closure and the decline in the fish community. Limited post-larval recruitment by means of wave-overtopping did, however, appear to continue even though the estuary mouth remained closed."
1461,3627,Fish community structure of the St Lucia Estuarine System under prolonged drought conditions and its potential for recovery after mouth breaching,"The St Lucia Estuarine System, South Africa, has been under pressure due to recent drought conditions, which have led to closure of the mouth, extremely low lake levels and hypersaline conditions. The estuary mouth closed in June 2002 and remained so for almost 5 years before being breached by Cyclone Gamede in May 2007. After mouth closure in August 2007, salinities in South and North Lake gradually increased to reach highs of 68 at the end of 2008, while salinities in the Narrows gradually declined during the study. Fish were sampled biannually during 2006-2008 with seine and gill-nets at six sites throughout the system. A total of 20,422 fish from 72 species were recorded, with the number of species and CPUE gradually decreasing from the Narrows throughout the system to Hells Gate in the upper parts of the system. The fish community was dominated by the freshwater species Oreochromis mossambicus, and two estuarine species, Ambassis ambassis and Hyporamphus capensis. The fish community was dominated in terms of species numbers by marine spawning species, but in terms of fish abundance by freshwater and estuarine breeding species. Recruitment of post-larvae of 20 marine species into the system occurred following opening of the mouth in March 2007, highlighting the importance of the system as a nursery area for marine species. The fish community was structured by spatial differences between sampling areas and between the three main compartments of the system, and not by temporal changes during the study period. "
1462,3638,"Fish assemblages in the Mfolozi-Msunduzi estuarine system, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, when not linked to the St Lucia mouth","The fish community of the Mfolozi-Msunduzi estuarine system was investigated with particular emphasis on its role as a nursery area for marine fish when the adjacent St Lucia mouth is closed. The mouth was open during March 2007 and 2008 with high-turbidity river water flowing into the sea, and was closed during August 2007 and 2008. Fish were sampled biannually with seine-nets during March and August in 2007 and 2008 at five sites throughout the system. A total of 5 886 fish from 59 species were recorded, with a higher number of species and CPUE in the Mfolozi Estuary than in the Msunduzi Estuary. Seine-net catches were dominated by Ambassis gymcocephalus, Ambassis natalensis, Leiognathus equula and Valamugil cunnesius. Juveniles of marine spawning species were present throughout the study period, even when the mouth was closed. The sampled fish assemblage structure was influenced by significant temporal differences between the four biannual sampling seasons, with relatively small spatial differences between the sampling areas. Temperature, salinity and sediment characteristics were most responsible for the structure of the fish assemblage as sampled by seine-nets. The results emphasise the importance of the Mfolozi-Msunduzi estuarine system as an alternate nursery area. "
1463,2375,"Population trends of Black Vulture Aegypius monachus in Dadia Forest, north-eastern Greece following the establishment of a feeding station","Dadia Forest in north-eastern Greece is well known for its diversity of breeding birds of prey. In 1980, the area was declared a wildlife reserve. One of the most endangered species at that time was the Black Vulture Aegypius monachus. To help the population of Black Vultures a feeding station was established in 1987. A monitoring programme from 1984 until present indicates that the operation of the feeding station has coincided with an increase in the numbers of Black Vultures wintering in Dadia by nearly threefold, an increase in the number of breeding pairs from 10 to 21, and an increase in breeding success from 40% to a peak of 95%. A slight faltering in the continued rise in the numbers of Black Vultures in Dadia is attributed to a poisoning event in 1995."
1464,2727,"The population dynamics of the longnose skate, Raja rhina, in the northeast Pacific Ocean","The longnose skate, Raja rhina, is the most commonly landed skate species in the northeast Pacific Ocean. It also dominates survey catches in the area. Existing knowledge on skate biology and fisheries suggests that large skate species with late sexual maturation, like the longnose skate, are extremely vulnerable to overfishing, and if overfished they are slow to recover. Historically, in the US Pacific Coast skates have not supported directed fisheries, but have been taken as bycatch in other commercially important fisheries. For the past 13 years, landed catches of skates in waters off Washington, Oregon and California have significantly increased. Using the Stock Synthesis 2 modeling framework, a population model for the longnose skate was developed to assess the current state of the stock and reconstruct its past dynamics. Model results indicate that the longnose skate spawning biomass has slowly declined since 1915; the current stock biomass is estimated as 66% of its unexploited level. Uncertainty in regards to fishery-dependent data and female maturity parameters was explored through sensitivity analyses. The model results indicate that it is important to conduct species-specific identification in the fishery and monitor discard of longnose skate to improve the accuracy of fishery catch data and make assessment conclusions more robust.

1465,1621,"A 13-Year Study of the Population Dynamics and Growth of the European Eel Anguilla anguilla in a Norwegian River: Evidence for Density-Dependent Mortality, and Development of a Model for Predicting Yield","In the Imsa River, SW Norway mean age of the descending silver eels was 7.9 yr; there was a significant relationship between number of elvers ascending and silver eels descending 8 yr later. The weak 1979 year-class could be recognized in the age-distribution samples. Instantaneous rate of total mortality based on age data varied from 0.088-0.225 for the 5 year-classes, and the mortality rate for 1975-1987 was estimated at 0.167 based on mean ascent and descent data. Numbers of ascending elvers varied strongly, and was significantly related to water temperature. Survival rate of eels in fresh water was density-dependent. The sex ratio (males/females) varied from 0.010-0.075, but this variation could not be explained by variation in elver numbers or by variation in eel density in the river during the first summer. Back-calculated growth rate of male silver eels and female silver eels >7 yr old was close to the growth rate of yellow eels of the same age. Females grew faster when they transformed at a younger age. Instantaneous growth rate for weight decreased from 1.4 the first season in fresh water to 0.2 for the 7th growth season onwards. Mean annual production in the system was 3.51 kg ha-1; mean yield was 2.27 kg ha-1. -from Authors"
1466,1912,Non-additive effects of density-dependent and density-independent factors on brown trout vital rates,"Interactions between density-dependent and density-independent processes can lead to variation in both growth and survival rates. Detecting such effects, however, will often require sampling on an individual level and at the appropriate spatial and temporal scale. This study documents substantial variation in survival and growth of stream-dwelling brown trout Salmo trutta from a small Norwegian stream. The data is based on seasonal capture-recaptures of individually marked trout on fixed stations during eight years. The fish were small-sized, rarely reaching sizes larger than 20 cm and ages older than seven years. Density varied between 0.2-0.8 fish m-2. Variation in survival and recapture probabilities was analysed using program MARK. Apparent survival (the probability of being alive and present within the study area) generally decreased with increasing trout density and increasing drought level (measured as lowest observed water flow) during both winter and summer. Further, there was a significant interaction effect between density and water flow, indicating that density-dependent effects on survival predominated when environmental conditions were benign (no drought), while density-independent processes were most important under harsh environmental conditions (drought). Observed length-at-age during autumn indicated a more or less linear growth trajectory throughout life, and no effect of density, water flow or temperature was found. However, using the individual-based capture-recapture data to estimated specific growth rate, significant positive effects of water flow and temperature and a negative effect of density were identified. Thus, the capture-recapture data suggest a strong potential for population regulation at the rather low densities found in this stream, and regulation may occur both through effects on survival and growth."
1467,2749,History and status of the population dynamics of moose in the steppe zone of Ukraine,"The moose (Alces alces) population in the steppe zone of Ukraine developed initially in 1955-1965. Early annual population growth rates were high ranging from 13-49% partly due to immigration of moose from Russia and Byelorussia. However, after fully occupying forest habitat and expanding to treeless biotopes, reproductive efficiency declined. This decline was influenced by large spatial isolation of suitable habitat; 52% of solitary males and 48% of solitary females were in isolated biotopes during breeding. Further, 8% of adult bulls were in herds without cows, and 21% of cows were in herds without bulls. Although individual productivity was good, 1.3[plus or minus]0.1 /pregnant cow and 0.4/ adult cow, isolation caused low participation in breeding (38.5% of adult cows), low number of calves (17.1% of population), and low annual population growth rate ([approximately equal] 6%/yr). The steppe moose population reached its maximum (n = 2776) in 1974 followed by steep decline; the decline was associated with harvests of 16.1% in 1973 and 12.5% in 1974, of which about 50% were adult animals. The population reached a second peak (n = 2147) in 1982 and declined gradually until 1992. A steep, annual population decline of 25.3[plus or minus]5.8% occurred after 1992; this decline was associated with excessive harvest beyond the annual population growth rate. Moose were extirpated from most regions of the steppe zone by the late 20th century. The current southern range of moose is limited to forest habitat, and except for a remnant population of about 80, the unique steppe population has disappeared from Ukraine."
1468,1900,Recruitment and survival of immature seabirds in relation to oil spills and climate variability,"1. In long-lived animals with delayed maturity, the non-breeding component of the population may play an important role in buffering the effects of stochastic mortality. Populations of colonial seabirds often consist of more than 50% non-breeders, yet because they spend much of their early life at sea, we understand little about their impact on the demographic process.2. Using multistate capture-mark-recapture techniques, we analyse a long-term data set of individually identifiable common guillemots, Uria aalge Pont., to assess factors influencing their immature survival and two-stage recruitment process.3. Analysis of the distribution of ringed common guillemots during the non-breeding season, separated by age classes, revealed that all age classes were potentially at risk from four major oil spills. However, the youngest age class (0-3 years) were far more widely spread than birds 4-6 years old, which were more widely spread than birds aged 6 and over. Therefore the chance of encountering an oil spill was age-dependent.4. A 2-year compound survival estimate for juvenile guillemots was weakly negatively correlated with winter sea-surface temperature, but was not influenced by oil spills. Non-breeder survival did not vary significantly over time.5. In years following four oil spills, juvenile recruitment was almost double the value in non-oil-spill years. Recent work from Skomer Island showed a doubling of adult mortality associated with major oil spills, which probably reduced competition at the breeding colony, allowing increased immature recruitment to compensate for these losses. We discuss the implications of compensatory recruitment for assessing the impact of oil pollution incidents."
1469,2516,Population and ecology of the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) and its conservation status in Slovenia,"In Slovenia, the White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) reaches the south-western limit of its distribution in Europe. Its status in Slovenia changed significantly throughout the last 250 years, especially at the end of 20,h century when the first breeding was confirmed. At the beginning of the 90ies, the size of the breeding population was estimated at 1-3 pairs, but after several new discoveries at the beginning of the 21st century, new estimates amount to 8-11 breeding pairs. The wintering population is still increasing with an annual increase of 9,7 +/- 4,9% according to data obtained during the winter waterbird censuses. The species is more abundant in E than in W Slovenia. Characteristic for the country are mountainous breeding territories, which are situated in large forest complexes, but usually near large takes or rivers. In winter, White,tailed Eagles are frequently present at large water bodies with high abundances of waterbirds, and the wintering areas of the species correspond well with its breeding grounds. In Slovenia, the White-tailed Eagle is officially protected since 1921, however, the main listed threats are illegal hunting, tourism, and intensive logging."
1470,2880,Marine biological community baselines in unimpacted tropical ecosystems: spatial and temporal analysis of reefs at Howland and Baker Islands,"Howland and Baker Islands are two small, isolated reef and sand islets located near the equator in the central Pacific Ocean that are situated approximately 60 km apart. In 2004 and 2006, species-level monitoring at multiple sites, coupled with towed-diver surveys in 2002, 2004, and 2006 on both of these federally protected islands, revealed diverse fish, coral, macroinvertebrate, and algal assemblages. This study examines inter- and intra-island spatial and temporal differences in community composition among sites and presents baseline biological community parameters for two of the least impacted reef systems in the world. Despite similarities in species composition, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and multidimensional scaling ordinations (nMDS) suggest biological communities at the two islands are distinct with Baker Island containing a greater percent cover of branched Acroporid corals and turf algae and Howland Island containing a greater percent cover of crustose coralline red algae and small, compact genera of coral. Both islands also contained considerable cover of non-invasive macroalgae. PERMANOVA further revealed benthic and fish species composition to differ between forereef and reef shelf sites from different sides of each island. When islands were considered as a whole, temporal changes were not noted between 2004 and 2006; however, temporal changes at select sites did occur, with coral cover decreasing significantly along the west side of Baker Island from 2004 to 2006."
1471,1281,The influence of prey consumption and demographic stochasticity on population growth rate of Isle Royale wolves Canis lupus,"The relationship between the rates of prey capture and predator population growth is a fundamental aspect of predation, yet it is rarely measured for vertebrate predators. For the isolated wolf population on Isle Royale, annual variation in kill rate explains 22% of the variation in wolf population growth rate. From the slope of this relationship, we estimate that the production efficiency (ratio of production to respiration) of wolves is between 0.5% and 1.5%. More generally, we assess the relative extent to which wolf population growth rate is affected by density dependence, prey availability (moose, Alces alces), winter weather, and demographic stochasticity. Prey availability explains the most variation in wolf growth rate (42%), but this is only recognized after accounting for the influence of a disease-induced population crash and age structure of the prey population (i.e. number of vulnerable moose, >9 years of age). Demographic stochasticity accounts for approximately 30% of the variation in wolf growth rate. This recognition is important, but not surprising, given that the average population size of Isle Royale wolves is 22. Previous work indicates that the effect of winter climate, as mediated through prey vulnerability and kill rates, is substantial. This work indicates that the direct effect of winter climate is weak, and explains only about 4% of the variation in wolf growth rate (P = 0.10)."
1472,3211,Terrestrial movements of juvenile and adult tailed frogs in relation to timber harvest in coastal British Columbia,"Tailed frog (Ascaphus truei Stejneger) populations are at risk in much of the Pacific Northwest, and recolonization of sites may be slow postlogging. To examine the terrestrial movements of Ascaphus in clearcuts and old growth, we employed pitfall traps and drift-fence arrays installed along streams and 100 m into upland habitat. In the fall, we captured frogs farther from streams in old growth than in clearcuts, and more frogs were captured ≤25 m from streams in clearcuts. Stronger stream affinity in clearcuts was most evident with juvenile frogs, which exhibited more upstream movements than adults. Compared with inland sites where frogs remained close to streams (e.g., 12 m), frogs at our coastal sites were captured at greater distances from streams (≥100 m), having lower stream affinity than frogs at inland sites. Long-distance overland movements appear more likely where forested stands are present. Aggregations of Ascaphus at individual streams may not represent distinct populations and should not be managed as distinct units. Preserving groups of interconnected streams within watersheds instead of individual streams will improve the conservation status of Ascaphus. Population monitoring can ensure conservation measures promote long-term persistence. "
1473,2065,Population changes and biology of the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans gibsoni at the Auckland Islands,"Gibson's wandering albatross Diomedea exulans gibsoni is endemic to the Auckland Islands in the New Zealand subantarctic. In 1991 a programme of regular census and population study was initiated to assess the impact of longline fisheries bycatch on the status of the subspecies. This paper reports on field work carried out on Adams I. in the Aucklands Islands group during January and February most years between 1991 and 1997. Over this seven-year period, the average annual number of pairs nesting on Adams I. was 5831. This is the first reliable estimate of the size of the population. Evidence of population changes on the Auckland Is is reviewed. Annual adult survival has been estimated for three years and averaged 97%; females have a 2% lower rate than males. D. .e. gibsoni were easily sexed by measurements. Productivity over five breeding seasons averaged 67%. Timing of egg-laying and nest-site fidelity of D. e. gibsoni are described and compared with those of other subspecies of wandering albatross."
1474,3681,Population size and structure of the Nile crocodile Crocodylus niloticus in the lower Zambezi valley," Concern has been raised about the lack of population data for the Nile crocodile Crocodylus niloticus in the lower/middle Zambezi valley. This area is important for conservation as well as being a source of crocodile eggs and adults for the ranching industry. Two spotlight surveys, in 2006 and 2009, were used to estimate population size, structure and trends. A stage-structured matrix model was parameterized from existing literature and the expected predictions were compared to those observed. The survey data suggests a population increase since 2006. Crocodile density was greatest (3.1 km -1) in the areas of increased wildlife and habitat protection and lowest (1.4 km-1) in areas of increased human presence. The predicted population stage structure differed to that observed, suggestive of a population not at equilibrium. Data on offtakes of crocodile eggs and adults would be useful for examining why this is the case. Continued monitoring of the wild population is necessary, to evaluate the trend of an increasing crocodile population, and additional demographic data for modelling purposes would be desirable. "
1475,3749,"Humboldt Penguin Spheniscus humboldti population in Chile: counts of moulting birds, February 1999-2008","We conducted annual counts of moulting Humboldt Penguins roosting on the mainland coast and on offshore islands in north and central Chile during 1999–2008. The census area included the known major breeding colonies in Chile, where many penguins moult, as well as other sites. Population size was relatively stable across years, with an average of 33 384 SD 2 372 (range: 28 642–35 284) penguins counted, but the number of penguins found at any individual site could vary widely. Shifting penguin numbers suggest that penguins tend to aggregate to moult where food is abundant. While many of the major breeding sites are afforded some form of protected status, two sites with sizable penguin populations, Tilgo Island and Pájaros-1 Island, have no official protection. These census results provide a basis upon which future population trends can be compared."
1476,1937,"Factors affecting black rhino monitoring in Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya","The black rhino in Africa is slowly recovering from poaching. This has been achieved in part by maintaining ongoing monitoring as part of intensive protection and biological management. However, the efficacy of population monitoring methods has not been assessed. Rhino surveillance records and rainfall data were used to determine which ecological and operational factors affected monthly rhino sightings by vehicle patrols in Masai Mara, Kenya. Comparisons of sightings capture rates using different groundbased and aerial methods were also conducted. Stepwise multiple regression revealed a model (adjusted R2 =0.66) predicting monthly rhino sightings with four significant factors; number of patrols, rhino population size, rainfall over the previous 2 months and a dummy variable for the month of August. The latter two variables represent the negative effects of long grass growth and the annual wildebeest migration on rhino sightings, and result in seasonal deficiencies tn monitoring. During vehicle patrols, 51% of sightings were made whilst moving, and 49% were made whilst stationary and scanning with binoculars, although sightings capture rate was an order of magnitude higher when stationary. Equally. sightings capture rate from hot air balloons was twice that during vehicle-based patrols, although with less accuracy of identification. The introduction of foot patrols would increase patrol cost-effectiveness and fill seasonal troughs, thereby providing better all-round surveillance."
1477,4465,Wintering waterbirds in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain: changes in abundance and distribution,"Summary The middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain is a globally important wintering area for waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Ornithologists have reported on wintering waterbirds in the floodplain since the 1950s. However, an integrated analysis of the long-term changes in waterbird diversity is not available. Here, we synthesise existing information on changes in wintering waterbird abundance and distribution in the floodplain, summarise possible influencing factors and propose some priorities for further research. Waterbird richness and abundance have declined over the past 60 years. Declining trends have been observed in a number of areas and species. Nevertheless, a few areas and species showed different trends. In addition, waterbirds have become more concentrated in a few suitable areas such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake. Land reclamation, hunting, dam operation and extensive aquaculture are probably the four major threats to wintering waterbirds, while establishment of nature reserves is beneficial to waterbird conservation. Our study suggests that waterbirds in the floodplain are vulnerable, and that effective conservation measures are needed to protect and restore the waterbird diversity of this area."
1478,2875,Effects of marine reserves on coral reef fish communities from five islands in New Caledonia,"The effect of marine reserve protection on coral reef fish communities was studied on five islands located in the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia. Commercial fish communities and Chaetodontidae, sampled before fishing prohibition and after five years of protection, were compared. Reference stations were also sampled to assess variability in unprotected communities on the same time scale. The hypothesis that marine reserves protect and develop fish stocks was confirmed. Species richness, density and biomass of fish on the protected reefs increased respectively by 67%, 160% and 246%. This increase was statistically significant, whereas the reference stations showed only a small increase in density. There were significant increases in the species richness, density and biomass of the major exploited fish families (Serranidae, Lutjanidae, Lethrinidae, Mullidae, Labridae, Scaridae, Siganidae and Acanthuridae) and also of the Chaetodontidae. No significant increase in the mean lengths of fishes was noted among the main species, with the exception of one species of Siganid. Size structure changed for most of the main species, as the proportion of small individuals increased after five years of protection. Detrended correspondance analysis indicated that marine reserve protection was the most important determinant of the fish community structure. The second determinant was the position along an inshore-offshore gradient. Marine reserve protection resulted in an increase in the relative abundance and species richness of large edible species within the assemblages."
1479,2986,Spatial and temporal trends in yellow stingray abundance: evidence from diver surveys,"Recent concerns about changing elasmobranch populations have prompted the need to understand their patterns of distribution and abundance through non-destructive sampling methods. Since scientific divers represent a small portion of the total number of divers worldwide, the use of non-scientific divers could drastically increase the number of observations needed to monitor broad-scale, long-term trends. Here, we use 83,940 surveys collected by trained volunteer divers to examine spatial and temporal trends of the most frequently sighted elasmobranch species in the greater-Caribbean, the yellow stingray (Urobatis jamaicensis). Despite being relatively common and listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, little is known about the status of this species. In total, yellow stingrays were observed on 5,658 surveys (6. 7% sighting frequency) with the highest occurrence in the regions surrounding Cuba. Overall, sighting frequency declined from 20. 5% in 1994 to 4. 7% in 2007-a standardized decline rate of -0. 11. However, these trends were not consistent in all regions. The strongest decline occurred in the Florida Keys, the most sampled region, where trends were similar among all areas, habitats and depths. In contrast, sighting frequency significantly increased in Jamaica where large fishes are severely depleted. We discuss possible explanations for these changes including habitat degradation, exploitation and changes in trophic interactions. Our results suggest large-scale changes in yellow stingray abundance that have been unnoticed by the scientific community. Thus, our study highlights the value of non-scientific divers for collecting data that can be used to understand population trends of otherwise poorly studied species. "
1480,3496,"Diet, growth, and abundance of two seagrass bed fishes along a pollution gradient caused by milkfish farming in Bolinao, northwestern Philippines.","The present study clarified the impacts of aquaculture pollution on the surrounding seagrass bed fishes by comparing the diet, growth, and abundance of Parupeneus barberinus and Acreichthys tomentosus along a pollution gradient caused by intensive milkfish Chanos chanos farming in Bolinao, northwestern Philippines. The two fish species and potential food items exhibited increasingly enriched δ13C values with greater distance from the milkfish farming area, thereby indicating that stable carbon isotopes facilitated good discrimination between fishes from polluted and unpolluted areas. P. barberinus fed on epi-/benthic crustaceans, whereas A. tomentosus consumed a wide range of food, including invertebrates and plant materials in the unpolluted areas, but zooplankton were the most commonly predated food items in the polluted areas for both species. The growth rate of P. barberinus was marginally lower in the polluted area than in the unpolluted area, whereas that of A. tomentosus did not differ between the two areas. The abundance of both species did not differ significantly between the polluted and unpolluted areas, but the growth patterns of the two species suggest that A. tomentosus has greater physiological tolerance of the polluted environment than P. barberinus."
1481,1334,Holding on in the Djebela: Barbary macaque Macaca sylvanus in northern Morocco,"A survey of Vulnerable Barbary macaque Macaca sylvanus populations in the Djebela region of northern Morocco was conducted in October-November 2004 and the species' presence verified in four areas. This macaque occurs in habitat types ranging from matorral (shrub vegetation) to higher altitude fir forest. A total of 89 individuals were observed in nine groups. Comparisons of our survey with the previous one undertaken in the same area in 1980 indicate that group sizes are similar but the total population size may have decreased. We estimate there is a population of 200-300 Barbary macaques in the Djebela. Although some areas where the species is found are now protected, further work will be crucial to safeguarding this species in northern Morocco. "
1482,4485,Seasonal patterns of reproduction and abundance of leaf litter frogs in a Central American rainforest,"Patterns of reproductive phenology and temporal variation in species composition and age structure were investigated for a sample of terrestrial leaf litter frogs from a lowland tropical rainforest in north-eastern Costa Rica. Recruitment of most species showed a seasonal pattern in which the growth of juveniles occurred during the dry season. The phenology of the assemblage was also seasonal, with a peak in abundance during the dry season. Variation in abundance was driven by seasonal patterns of juvenile recruitment in one species, Eleutherodactylus brandsfordii. We suggest that the timing of reproduction and patterns of frog phenology may be tied to the availability of arthropod prey items. A comparison of our data with data collected at other rainforest sites in Central America and the Amazon basin of South America indicates that patterns of recruitment and abundance, while correlated with arthropod abundance on both continents, show divergent seasonal patterns. This and other studies indicate that peaks in abundance and recruitment of juvenile frogs are concentrated in the dry season in Central America, whereas in South American rainforests, the wet season is the period of highest abundance and juvenile recruitment. We suggest that the length and severity of dry periods in the Amazon basin limits the ability of terrestrial frogs to reproduce successfully, while in Central America a more benign dry season, while strong enough to create distinct seasonal trends in the phenology of rainforest animals, is not strong enough to prohibit frogs from recruiting juveniles during the dry season."
1483,1636,Demographic Causes and Predictive Models of Population Fluctuations in Red Grouse,"Lagopus lagopus scoticus were studied at a moor in NE Scotland in 1961-78. A fluctuation of c2-fold amplitude in breeding densities occurred in 1963-69, and a 5-fold one in 1969-77. Grouse tended to breed well in years of increase and more poorly in years of peak and decline, but there were exceptions. There were fewer hens than cocks in spring, and many fewer in some years of decline. Many birds emigrated in summer during decline years. Winter losses were only partly due to deaths in the area, and in most years involved much emigration. Intrinsic processes within the population caused losses more by emigration, and extrinsic processes imposed on the population more by death. The ratio of hens to cocks in spring, extent of summer emigration, number of chicks per hen in August, and winter loss were all correlated with one another. Variation in spring numbers could be accounted for by a multiple regression on the previous year's spring sex ratio, the extent of summer emigration, and the number of chicks per hen present in August. These 3 measures were combine in a chick production ratio (the ratio of half the young birds present in August to the number of adult cocks in spring, and similarly for hens). Changes in spring numbers could be predicted from the observed chick production ratio each year. Models based entirely on demographic data, with no explict environmental effect on numbers, fitted observed numbers reasonably well. The only observed extrinsic environmental relationship with numbers was the proportion of nests robbed.-from Authors"
1484,3834,Sudden and rapid decline of the abundant marsupial Bettongia penicillata in Australia,"The woylie Bettongia penicillata is categorized as Critically Endangered, having declined by c. 90% between 1999 and 2006. The decline continues and the cause is not fully understood. Within a decline diagnosis framework we characterized the nature of the decline and identified potential causes, with a focus on the species' largest populations, located in south-west Western Australia. We described the spatio-temporal pattern of the decline, and several attributes that are common across sites. We categorized the potential causes of the decline as resources, predators, disease and direct human interference. Based on the available evidence the leading hypothesis is that disease may be making woylies more vulnerable to predation but this remains to be tested. No substantial recoveries have been sustained to date, and one of the three remaining indigenous populations now appears to be extinct. Therefore, verifying the factors causing the decline and those limiting recovery is becoming increasingly urgent. Active adaptive management can be used to test putative agents, such as introduced predators. Insurance populations and ecological monitoring should also be included in an integrated conservation and management strategy for the species."
1485,660,Synchronous variation and long-term trends in two populations of black rat snakes,"Synchronous variation among animal populations affects the vulnerability of endangered species and is relevant to understanding population fluctuation generally. We analyzed data collected over 18 years from two populations of black rat snakes (Elaphe o. obsoleta), a species of conservation concern in Canada, to determine whether the populations varied synchronously. Because the populations were 30 km apart and genetically distinct, synchrony should be attributable to common stochastic environmental factors, the Moran effect. Synchronous variation in annual estimates of population size, survival probability, recruitment, and age structure all provided evidence of a Moran effect. However, opposite trends in age structure through time suggested that the internal dynamics of the two populations were different. The conservation implication of synchrony is that this population of rat snakes is vulnerable to stochastic environmental phenomena because all subpopulations could become rare simultaneously. Evidence of different population processes in the two populations suggests, however, that local factors may be of more immediate relevance to conservation than regional phenomena. More generally, these results indicate that evidence of synchronous variation in population size and similar long-term population trends - both populations appeared to be declining - are not necessarily indicative of common underlying population dynamics."
1486,1890,"Population ecology of the velvet gecko, Oedura lesueurii in south eastern Australia: Implications for the persistence of an endangered snake","Ecological specialization, such as major dependence upon a single-prey species, can render a predator taxon vulnerable to extinction. In such cases, understanding the population dynamics of that prey type is important for conserving the predator that relies upon it. In eastern Australia, the endangered broad-headed snake Hoplocephalus bungaroides feeds largely on velvet geckos (Oedura lesueurii). We studied growth, longevity and reproduction in a population of velvet geckos in Morton National Park in south-eastern Australia. We marked 458 individual geckos over a 3-year period (1992-1995) and made yearly visits to field sites from 1995-2006 to recapture marked individuals. Female geckos grew larger than males, and produced their first clutch at age 4 years. Males can mature at 2 years, but male-male combat for females probably forces males to delay reproduction until age 3 years. Females lay a single clutch of two eggs in communal nests in November, and up to 22 females deposited eggs in a single nest. Egg hatching success was high (100%), and juveniles had high survival (76%) during their first 6 months of life. Velvet geckos are long-lived, and the mean age of marked animals recaptured after 1995 was 6.1 years (males) and 8.4 years (females). Older females (7.5-9.5 years) were all gravid when last recaptured. Like other temperate-climate gekkonids, O. lesueurii has a 'slow' life history, and population viability could be threatened by any factors that increase egg or adult mortality. Two such factors - the removal of 'bush rocks' for urban gardens, and the overgrowth of rock outcrops by vegetation - could render small gecko populations vulnerable to extinction. In turn, the reliance of predatory broad-headed snakes on this slow-growing lizard species may increase its vulnerability to extinction."
1487,4201,Spinner dolphins Stenella longirostris off southwest Mauritius: abundance and residency,"Spinner dolphins Stenella longirostris longirostris off the south-west coast of Mauritius are subject to ongoing anthropogenic disturbance in the form of daily dolphin tourism, which has intensified since 1998. Abundance of; this species was estimated using photo-identification data and mark-recapture analysis. Between April 2008 and June 2010, identification photographs were collected from dolphins occurring along a 30 km length of the coast of south-west Mauritius. A total of 250 groups were encountered over 229 survey days. Mark-recapture analyses were performed on a photographic dataset of more than 8 000 good- and excellent-quality images and 83 animals were identified as distinctively marked individuals. The majority (85.5%) were seen more than once and resightings indicated a resident population. The compiled version of SOCPROG 2.4 was used to investigate the lagged identification rate. The fitted model supported a mostly resident population with additional animals moving in and; out of the study area. The estimated abundance of the total population in the study area ranged between 138 and 399 individuals. Our results can be used for monitoring the population for fluctuations and for encouraging both the enforcement of laws regarding dolphin watching and the development of further means of management needed to ensure the long-term presence of this population."
1488,1885,"Predator-prey relationships and responses of ungulates and their predators to the establishment of protected areas: a case study of tigers, leopards and their prey in Bardia National Park, Nepal","Interactions among sympatric large predators and their prey and how they respond to conservation measures are poorly known. This study examines predictions concerning the effects of establishing a protected area in Nepal on tigers (Panthera tigris), leopards (Panthera pardus), and their ungulate prey. Within a part of the park, after 22 years the total density of wild ungulates had increased fourfold, to ca. 200 animals/km2, almost exclusively due to a remarkable increase in chital deer (Axis axis). Tiger density also increased markedly to nearly 20 animals/100 km2, whereas leopard density did not and was ca. 5 animals/ 100 km2. The prediction that grazers should increase more than browsers was only partially supported. The prediction of positive density dependence in prey selection was not supported. Instead, the most abundant species (chital and hog deer, Axis porcinus) were killed less frequently than expected, whereas the lower-density wild boar (Sus scrofa) was preferred. Predictions that (i) initially rare species suffer highest predation was partially supported, that (ii) predation is highest among the most abundant prey was not supported, and that (iii) predation is highest among the most preferred prey independently of their densities was supported. Clearly, the conservation efforts adopted in Bardia were successful, as both tigers and their natural prey base increased. However, the positive numerical response of tigers limited and depressed the abundance of some prey species. Thus, conservation activities aimed at restoring large predators are likely to change in the composition of the overall mammal community, potentially eliminating rare but preferred prey species.

1489,1744,"Biology, fisheries, and conservation of sturgeons and paddlefish in China","This paper reviews five of the eight species of acipenseriforms that occur in China, chiefly those of the Amur and Yangtze rivers. Kaluga Huso dauricus and Amur sturgeon Acipenserschrenckii are endemic to the Amur River. Both species still support fisheries, but stocks are declining due to overfishing. Acipenseriformes of the Yangtze River are primarily threatened by hydroelectric dams that block free passage to spawning and feeding areas. The Chinese paddlefish Psephurus gladius now is rare in the Yangtze River system, and its spawning activities were severely limited by completion of the Gezllouba Dam in 1981. Since 1988, only 3-10 adult paddlefishes per year have been found below the dam. Limited spawning still exists above the dam, but when the new Three Gorges Dam is complete, it will further threaten the paddlefish. Artificial propagation appears to be the only hope for preventing extinction of P. gladius, but it has yet to be successfully bred in captivity. Dabry's sturgeon A. dabryanus is a small, exclusively freshwater sturgeon found only in the Yangtze River system. It is concentrated today in reaches of the main stream above Gezhouba Dam. The fishery has been closed since 1983, but populations continue to decline. Acipenser dabryanus has been cultured since the 1970s, and holds promise for commercial aquaculture; availability of aquacultural methods offers hope for enhancing natural populations. The Chinese sturgeon A. sinensis occurs in the Yangtze and Pearl rivers and seas of east Asia. There is still disagreement about the taxonomy of the Pearl and Yangtze River populations. The Yangtze River population is anadromous. Adults begin spawning at about age 14 years (males) and 21 years (females), and adults spend over 15 months in the river for reproduction. Spawning sites of A. sinensis were found every year since 1982 below the Gezhouba Dam, but it seems that insufficient suitable ground is available for spawning. Since 1983, commercial fishing has been prohibited but more measures need to be taken such as establishing protected areas and characterizing critical spawning, summering and wintering habitats."
1490,1036,Population dynamics of wandering albatross Diomedea exulans and Amsterdam albatross D-amsterdamensis in the Indian Ocean and their relationships with long-line fisheries: Conservation implications,"Studies carried out over the past three decades at Crozet and Kerguelen Islands in the Indian Ocean indicate that wandering albatross. Diomedea exulans populations declined markedly, but since 1986 have shown slow recovery. The population of the endangered Amsterdam albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis appears to have similarly recovered since 1985, but remains close to extinction. A demographic study of the Crozet population indicates that the earlier decline was mainly the result of increased adult mortality, and secondarily of low recruitment. Satellite tracking studies of breeding birds and band recoveries of non-breeding birds indicate that during and outside the breeding season these population are in contact with long-term fisheries, mainly the pelagic Japanese southern blue-fin tuna Thunnus maccoyii fishery and to a lesser extent the Patagonian tooth-fish Dissostichus eleginoides fishery operating on the Kerguelen shelf. Decreased fishing effort and a concentration outside the central Indian Ocean by the Japanese fishery during recent years has probably resulted in the slow recovery of these albatross populations as a result of improved adult survival and recruitment. Long-line fisheries still represent a major threat to great albatross populations, most of which are still declining in the Southern Ocean. Possible conservation measures to reduce mortality in the fishery and to reduce contacts between units and foraging albatrosses are examined."
1491,1033,The breeding biology and population dynamics of king penguins Aptenodytes patagonica on the Crozet Islands,"Among King Penguins Aptenodytes patagonica at Possession Island, one of the Crozet Islands, the length of the moult period, pre‐laying period, incubating and brooding shifts were highly variable according to the year and to the stage of the breeding season. The moulting period was shorter in late breeders than in early breeders. Only half of the birds which successfully reared a chick bred the following cycle, but late in the season. Almost all these late breeders were unsuccessful. The reasons for the high variability in the breeding pattern observed in this species between years, as well as between colonies and between individuals are discussed. Breeding success was on average 30.6% and survival during the first year at sea could reach 50%. The survival of adult birds has increased during the past 10 years from 90.7% to 95.2% per annum. Despite an almost biennial breeding frequency and a very high rate of chick loss during the winter fast, the King Penguin population of Possession Island has doubled between 1966 and 1985 due to a high survival rate of adult and immature birds. The increase during the last decade in adult survival and in adult and chick condition suggests that the population increase could be the result of an improvement in food availability. "
1492,1346,"Nesting and at-sea distribution of marine turtles in Angola, West Africa, 2000–2006: occurrence, threats and conservation implications","The status of marine turtles in Angola, West Africa, is poorly known, and therefore during 2000-2006 a combination of both dedicated and opportunistic beach and at-sea turtle surveys were carried out, and interviews conducted with fishing communities and at markets. Green Chelonia mydas, olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea, leatherback Dermochelys coriacea and loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta were recorded, and nesting of the first three species confirmed during September-March (peaking November-December). Green turtles nested mainly in the south, leatherback turtles in north and central Angola, and olive ridley turtle nesting was widespread. Olive ridley turtle nest density at Palmeirinhas averaged 32 nests km-1. At-sea surveys produced 298 turtle records, with peak occurrence during August. Significant anthropogenic-related mortality (including exploitation of meat and eggs and fishing bycatch) was recorded, in addition to natural predation and other threats. Maintenance of the long-term sustainability of these turtle populations should focus on the involvement of fishing communities and increasing awareness throughout Angola. "
1493,2142,Temporal trends in abundance of fish in the tidal Delaware River,"Water quality in the tidal Delaware River has improved dramatically over the last several decades. Areas near Philadelphia that were once anoxic and formed a pollution block to migratory fish passage now rarely experience dissolved oxygen concentrations less than 3 ppm. To assess whether these improvements in water quality led to increased abundance of juvenile fishes, data from a beach seine survey conducted annually since 1980 were examined. The number of species captured increased throughout the tidal river, but the increase was greatest in the areas downstream of Philadelphia, where water quality has improved the most. Abundance of juvenile striped bass and American shad, two important game species in the river whose migratory patterns make them susceptible to water quality problems, both increased more than 1,000-fold during the last decade. Correlations between the temporal abundance patterns of these species in the tidal Delaware River and in other East Coast systems were poor, suggesting that increases in their numbers were related more closely to improving conditions within the Delaware than to factors affecting coastal stocks."
1494,2917,Population cycles in the Varied Thrush (Ixoreus naevius),"The Varied Thrush (Ixoreus naevius), an endemic species of the Pacific Northwest of North America, shows dramatic year-to-year changes in wintering abundance. These changes have not, however, been systematically examined using standardized data. Using Project FeederWatch data from 1988-1989 to 1994-1995 we found that Varied Thrushes showed a biennial cyclic change in abundance within most of their normal wintering range. This cyclic pattern was also evident in Christmas Bird Count and Breeding Bird Survey data from the same time period. There was no difference in the extent or location of the winter range or in the distribution of elevations of Varied Thrush records between years of high and low abundance. More feeders had single Varied Thrushes in years of high abundance than in years of low abundance. Longer term (1969-1970 to 1994-1995) Christmas Bird Count and Breeding Bird Survey data showed a more variable pattern, with abundance peaks every 2-3 years. The number of vagrant Varied Thrushes from eastern North America reported in Audubon Field Notes winter season reports was not correlated with abundance in the normal wintering and breeding areas but was correlated with the number of Varied Thrushes tallied on southern California Christmas Bird Counts. These results suggest that patterns of vagrancy in Varied Thrushes are largely independent of population changes within the normal wintering area."
1495,3989,Arctic ground squirrel population collapse in the boreal forests of the Southern Yukon,"Context The arctic ground squirrel (Urocitellus parryii) comprised 17% of the biomass of herbivores in the Yukon boreal forest during the summer months from 1987 to 1996 and was responsible for 23% of the energy flow at the herbivore level. By 2000, ground squirrel populations in this region collapsed to nearly zero and have remained there. Aims We summarise the population monitoring (since 1975) and recent experimental work that has been done on this key herbivore in the Kluane area of the southern Yukon to test one mechanistic hypothesis as the possible explanation for this population collapse and subsequent lack of recovery: predation. Methods Ground squirrels are the preferred summer prey of bird and mammal predators when snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) populations are declining. We used translocations into formerly occupied habitat and radiotelemetry to determine movements and causes of death from 2009 to 2014. We surveyed 158 sites between 2008 and 2013 to measure the disappearance of colonies in alpine and forest habitats over 25000km2. Key results Ground squirrels from 2000 to 2013 comprised a small fraction of the herbivore biomass in the boreal forest zone, down from 17% earlier. Most forest populations (∼95%) are currently extinct, whereas just over half (65%) of low-elevation meadow populations are locally extinct. One hypothesis is that ground squirrels in the forest have been driven into a predator pit from which they cannot recover. They remain abundant in alpine tundra (93% occupancy rate) and around airport runways and human habitations (97% occupancy), but there is no apparent dispersal from alpine areas down into the boreal forest. Conclusion The predator pit hypothesis is a likely explanation for the initial collapse and sustained decline in population size from 2000 to 2013. Recent attenuation of the hare cycle and milder winter climate have allowed shrubs to expand throughout the forest, thereby reducing visibility and increasing predation risk. This conclusion will be tested in further research using reintroductions to formerly occupied sites. Implication If the loss of this herbivore from the boreal forest is not reversed, predator pressure on the other major herbivores of the montane forest zone is likely to change significantly."
1496,3628,"Assessment of catch, effort and species changes in the pair-trawl fishery of southern Lake Malawi, Malawi, Africa","Catch per unit effort (CPUE) and species composition in the pair-trawl fishery in commercial Area A of southern Lake Malawi were assessed from 1991 to 2001. CPUE declined from 1.7 t day-1 in 1995 to 0.5 t day-1 in 2001 and the fishery is considered depleted. In 2000/ 2002, catch composition differed significantly from a 1991 survey, and was dominated by haplochromine cichlids (92% by weight). Of 98 haplochromine cichlid taxa identified in the catch, 18 contributed ≥1% by weight. The artisanal fishery targeted similar species of a similar size. It was recommended that: (1) renewed investment and increased effort in the pair-trawl fishery is not advisable; (2) there was a need for effort limitation in Area A and (3) the pair-trawl fishery should not be managed in isolation of the artisanal fishery.

1497,1763,"Population declines of a long-lived salamander: a 20+-year study of hellbenders, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis","Accurate assessment of whether long-lived species are stable or declining is challenging. Life history characteristics such as delayed maturity result in relatively slow population responses to perturbations, so data should be collected across a relatively long time span. Because differential effects on age classes can be important, studies should also examine potential changes in the population's age structure. Moreover, multiple populations should be studied to indicate whether changes are regional or are restricted to local populations. We incorporated all three factors (long duration, multiple populations, age structure data) into our study of the conservation status of a long-lived aquatic salamander, the hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis. Over the 20 + years of this study, populations of hellbenders declined by an average of about 77%. This decline was characterized by a shift in size (age) structure, with a disproportionate decrease in numbers of young individuals. The change in density and age structure was consistent for populations in five rivers and for two subspecies (C. a. alleganiensis and C. a. bishopi), indicating that the decline is not restricted to one or two local populations. For the population with the most extensive data, the decline had clearly begun by the 1980s and there was a significant decrease in body condition over the period of the study. It is not known whether population declines for hellbenders have a single cause or whether each population has experienced independent declines. "
1498,4482,Shifting elasmobranch community assemblage at Cocos Island - an isolated marine protected area,"Fishing pressure has increased the extinction risk of many elasmobranch (shark and ray) species. Although many countries have established no-take marine reserves, a paucity of monitoring data means it is still unclear if reserves are effectively protecting these species. We examined data collected by a small group of divers over the past 21 years at one of the world's oldest marine protected areas (MPAs), Cocos Island National Park, Costa Rica. We used mixed effects models to determine trends in relative abundance, or probability of occurrence, of 12 monitored elasmobranch species while accounting for variation among observers and from abiotic factors. Eight of 12 species declined significantly over the past 2 decades. We documented decreases in relative abundance for 6 species, including the iconic scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) (-45%), whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus) (-77%), mobula ray (Mobula spp.) (-78%), and manta ray (Manta birostris) (-89%), and decreases in the probability of occurrence for 2 other species. Several of these species have small home ranges and should be better protected by an MPA, which underscores the notion that declines of marine megafauna will continue unabated in MPAs unless there is adequate enforcement effort to control fishing. In addition, probability of occurrence at Cocos Island of tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), and whale (Rhincodon typus) sharks increased significantly. The effectiveness of MPAs cannot be evaluated by examining single species because population responses can vary depending on life history traits and vulnerability to fishing pressure."
1499,1678,"Yellowstone's ungulates after wolves – expectations, realizations, and predictions","We evaluated the initial implications of wolf (Canis lupus) recovery on ungulates in Yellowstone National Park and compared expectations prior to wolf restoration with observed impacts since restoration. The numerical and functional responses of colonizing wolves in Yellowstone's prey-rich environment were higher than expected and close to the maximum rates predicted prior to wolf restoration. Counts of northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) decreased more (50%) than predicted (5-30%), and will likely continue to decrease given the strong preference of wolves for elk and continued high kill rates despite this substantial reduction in elk abundance. Contrary to expectations, human harvests were not reduced appreciably concurrent with wolf restoration, but instead remained similar to pre-wolf restoration years. However, antler-less permits were gradually reduced by 51% during 2000-2004 and additional reductions may be necessary while wolf densities remain high. There have been no substantial effects of wolf recovery on other ungulate species (bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), bison (Bison bison), moose (Alces alces), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana)). However, wolf recovery may eventually contribute to increased bison and pronghorn abundance by decreasing elk and coyote abundance, respectively. Wolf recovery may also contribute to more-pronounced spatial structuring of sex/age classes of northern Yellowstone elk through changes in their distribution, migration, and age structure. The initial consequences of wolf recovery support the premise that wolves may naturally achieve densities above their threshold for ecological effectiveness and contribute to significant changes in ecosystems, including the amelioration of ungulate-caused landscape simplification."
1500,545,Past and distant whaling and the rapid decline of sperm whales off the Galapagos Islands.,"It is generally expected that exploited whale populations should rebuild following the end of whaling. Using photographic identification of individuals during a series of field projects, we studied female and immature sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) that visit the waters off the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Analysis of mark-recapture data, using a likelihood model, indicates the population decreased at a rate of about 20% per year (95% c.i. 7-32%) between 1985-1995. During the study period the animals were not hunted and were not obviously the subject of other immediate anthropogenic threats. Rates at which research vessels encountered whales also fell over this interval The decline seems to be due principally to migration into waters off the Central and South American mainland. The population also has a very low recruitment rate, about 0.05 calves/female/year, as indicated by rates of observation of calves. Although other causes, cannot be ruled out, both the high emigration rate and low recruitment rate are probably related to heavy whaling in Peruvian waters which ended in 1981. Whales from the Galapagos are moving east to fill productive but depopulated waters near the coast, and the virtual elimination of large breeding males (in their late twenties and older) from the region has lowered pregnancy rates. The case of the Galapagos sperm whales strongly suggests that exploitation can continue to have substantial negative impacts on the size and recruitment rate of an animal population well outside the range of the hunt and for at least a decade after it has ended."
1501,1526,Estimates of current global population size and historical trajectory for sperm whales.,"Assessments of sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus abundance based on invalid analyses of whaling data are common in the literature. Modern visual surveys have produced population estimates for a total of 24% of the sperm whale's global habitat. I corrected these assessments for whales missed on the track line and then used 3 methods to scale up to a global population. Scaling using habitat area, plots of 19th century catches and primary production produced consistent global population estimates of about 360 000 whales (CV = 0.36). This is approximately 20% of the numbers reproduced in current literature from invalid whaling-based estimates. A population model, based on that used by the International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee, and which considers uncertainty in population parameters and catch data, was used to estimate population trajectories. Results suggest that pre-whaling numbers were about 1 110 000 whales (95% CI: 672 000 to 1 512 000), and that the population was about 71% (95% CI: 52 to 100%) of its original level in 1880 as open-boat whaling drew to a close and about 32% (95% CI: 19 to 62%) of its original level in 1999, 10 yr after the end of large-scale hunting. Thus, widely held views about the status of sperm whale populations need considerable revision."
1502,3258,"Trends in cetacean abundance in the Gully submarine canyon, 1988–2011, highlight a 21% per year increase in Sowerby’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens)","Long time series of abundance data have advanced ecological understanding. I examined trends in incidental sightings; of cetaceans in the Gully and neighbouring submarine canyons on the edge of the Scotian Shelf during summers between 1988; and 2011. There were a total of 2938 h of sighting effort in good conditions. I fit Poisson models to the sighting count data, and; examined the support for models that included parameters representing monthly variations in abundance, trends over years,; and different sighting rates in the different canyons. Sowerbys beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens (Sowerby, 1804)) were sighted; 3.5 times more often in the Shortland and Haldimand canyons, compared with the Gully. For all other species, the best-supported; models did not include differential sighting rates between canyons. The sighting rates of four species decreased over the 23 years; of the study, while three species increased. Some of these trends may be related to changes in overall population size or variation; in food resources, but a remarkable 21%/year increase in Sowerbys beaked whale is perhaps most plausibly explained by a; reduction in anthropogenic disturbance."
1503,1941,"A comparison of methods used to count the elephant population of the Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa","Evaluation of alternative techniques used to estimate elephant population sizes is important in order to assess the accuracy of the results obtained, upon which management decisions may be based. Data from annual helicopter surveys carried out in the Addo Elephant National Park (1978-97) are compared with registration counts obtained from intensive ground surveys in which all elephants within the park are individually known. On average, total population size estimated in aerial surveys is 8.0% lower than registration counts (n1997 = 251), aerial calf (< 1 year) counts are 48.8% lower than registration counts, and aerial carcass counts are 50% below the total number of deaths documented in ground surveys. Registration counts provide more accurate demographic data than aerial surveys, the results of which are shown to vary widely and unpredictably, thus compromising their value. Where population estimates rely exclusively on aerial surveys, replicate counts are recommended in order to generate confidence intervals."
1504,2597,"Establishment, growth and conservation of a mainland colony of Jackass penguins Spheniscus demersus at Stony Point, Betty's Bay, South Africa","Whittington, P.A., Hofmeyr, J.H. … Cooper, J. 1996. Establishment, growth and conservation of a mainland colony of Jackass Penguins Spheniscus demersus at Stony Point, Betty's Bay, South Africa. Ostrich 67: 144–150. Following the discovery of a single pair of Jackass Penguins Spheniscus demersus nesting on the mainland at Stony Point, Western Cape Province, South Africa (34 22S 18 53E) in 1982, a colony developed and has since been regularly monitored. Numbers of nests increased to 35 in 1986, until a leopard Panthera pardus severely reduced the size of the colony. Numbers subsequently rose again to a total of 139 nests in 1990, but fell to 57 in 1993. This decrease was probably due to predation by mammals. Following the use of a trap and translocation of the animals caught, the colony increased again in 1995 and 1996. Productivity of the colony was insufficient for it to be self-sustaining, and it therefore presently represents a population sink. "
1505,1398,"Evaluation of the effects of catch-and-release angling on the Ponoi River, Kola Peninsula, Russian Federation","We studied the effects of catch-and-release fishing upon the Ponoi River's Atlantic salmon populations. The Ponoi River is located on the Kola Peninsula of the Russian Federation, and has recently been developed for sports fishing. Angler exploitation rates are estimated to range from 10.4% to 19% of the river's salmon, thus the possibility of significant levels of post-release mortality is of concern. We radio-tracked fish caught and released by anglers in 1995 and 1996. Despite our simple equipment and the large size of the river, we were able to relocate most fish. These fish had high rates of survival, and anglers recaptured about 11% of them per year a second time. This is very similar to the recapture rates observed for Floy-tagged fish released in an angler-based mark-recapture assessment. We also held 62 angled fish for 24 hours in a live cage to evaluate rates of delayed mortality. Only one of the 62 fish died, and it was heavily scarred with gillnet marks. Most fish that are fatally stressed by angling die within 24 h (e.g., Booth et al. 1995). In 1996, up to 10% of our Floy-tagged fish were angled and released twice, and about 0.5% were angled and released three times. No significant biases were detected in the post-angling movement patterns of these fish. The multiple captures and lack of movement bias suggest that fish behavior was little altered by the angling experience. Nine fish Floy tagged prior to spawning have been recovered as typical emaciated kelts. Three were killed, and a post mortem exam showed all had spawned. Parr numbers at all monitored sites have been steadily increasing since the advent of catch-and-release fishing. By contrast, parr growth rates are generally unchanged or significantly better."
1506,2648,Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae): A review of conservation status,"The majority of wild Sumatran tigers are believed to live in 12 Tiger Conservation Landscapes covering approximately 88 000 km2. However, the actual distribution of tigers across Sumatra has never been accurately mapped. Over the past 20 years, conservation efforts focused on the Sumatran tigers have increased, but the population continues to decline as a result of several key threats. To identify the status of the Sumatran tiger distribution across the island, an island-wide questionnaire survey comprised of 35 respondents from various backgrounds was conducted between May and June 2010. The survey found that Sumatran tigers are positively present in 27 habitat patches larger than 250 km2 and possibly present in another 2. In addition, a review on major published studies on the Sumatran tiger was conducted to identify the current conservation status of the Sumatran tiger. Collectively, these studies have identified several key factors that have contributed to the decline of Sumatran tiger populations, including: forest habitat fragmentation and loss, direct killing of tigers and their prey, and the retaliatory killing of tigers due to conflict with villagers. The present paper provides management authorities and the international community with a recent assessment and a base map of the actual distribution of Sumatran tigers as well as a general overview on the current status and possible future conservation challenges of Sumatran tiger management."
1507,2133,"Status, distribution, and abundance of Black Brant on the mainland of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Northwest Territories, 1995-1998","To determine the distribution and abundance of Black Brant Branta bernicla nigricans on the mainland of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, aerial surveys were flown over a 5014-km2 area of the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, Mackenzie Delta, and western Liverpool Bay in June of 1995-1998. The estimated number of Brant, corrected for birds not seen by observers, was 2756 ± 413 (standard error) (0.56 ± 0.08 birds/km2 on 4930 km2) at the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula - Mackenzie Delta and 3176 ± 588 (37.81 ± 7.00 birds/km2 on 84 km2) at Campbell Island - Smoke-Moose Delta in Liverpool Bay. Another 76-225 Brant were found on small islands in western Liverpool Bay just outside the survey strata. Thus, the total population estimate for the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, Mackenzie Delta, and western Liverpool Bay was 6100 birds. Numbers of Brant at western Liverpool Bay have apparently increased since the 1970s or 1980s. Several hundred Black Brant also nest at the Anderson River delta (just east of our survey area), where numbers appear to have declined substantially since the 1970s or earlier. Recaptures of banded Brant suggest that some breeding individuals may have shifted from Anderson River to western Liverpool Bay (approximately 70 km west). Significant numbers of previously marked Black Brant were recaptured during banding drives in 1990-1998, and this information provided a Jolly-Seber estimate, which included both survey strata and Anderson River, of 6211 ± 868 Brant. The proportion of young birds among flocks captured during banding drives varied greatly from year to year (from 8% to 54% young), indicating that annual reproductive success was quite variable and sometimes low. Our results provide a baseline against which future population estimates can be compared."
1508,2583,"The demography of the lizard Tropidurus torquatus (Squamata, Tropiduridae) in a highly seasonal neotropical savanna","The demography of a population of Tropidurus torquatus was studied from March 1996 until December 1998, in the Cerrado biome of central Brazil, using the method of capture and recapture. Population size, number of incoming individuals in the population, and age structure varied seasonally, reflecting the reproductive cycle of the species. The instantaneous rate of population increase did not differ from zero throughout the study. In general, the permanence rates of juveniles and adults were low, indicating a large turnover of individuals in the population, with a maximum life expectancy of three years. The sex-ratio among adults was biased toward females. Since no bias was observed among juveniles and there was no difference in adult permanence between sexes, we suggest that the biased adult sex-ratio resulted from a lower permanence of males during a short ontogenetic period, when secondary sexual characteristics develop. When compared to T. itambere, the studied population of T. torquatus attained a higher density and a greater female bias in the sex-ratio. In general, the studied population presented characteristics that, according to life history theory, should be associated with early age at maturity and polygyny: short life expectancy, high population turn over, and female biased sex-ratios."
1509,2796,Exploitation status of cardinalfish (Epigonus crassicaudus) in Chile,"The exploitation status of cardinalfish (Epigonus crassicaudus) yielded in Chile between 33[degree] to 41[degree]S was analyzed. An indirect assessment was performed between 1997 and 2003 through size-structured model with a transition matrix defining the changes among sizes. The model was calibrated using size structures, official landings, catch-per-unit of effort (CPUE) taken from commercial fishing logbooks and standardized by generalized linear models (GLM). After 7 years of an intense fishery activity, we concluded that the cardinalfish resource in Chile is on the recruitment overfishing limit. On 2003, the spawning biomass with respect to the virginal spawning biomass is close to 40%. The biological references points (BRP) based on spawning per recruit biomass (SPR) support this assesment because the fishing mortality level on 2003 (Fact) was very close to fishing mortality level of 40% of SRP at virginal value (F40%)."
1510,2096,Spatial and temporal variability in surf zone fish assemblages on the coast of northern New Jersey,"The surf zone fish community along 15 km of northern New Jersey shoreline was sampled every 2 weeks by beach seine in the late summers and early falls of 1995-1999 in conjunction with monitoring of a beach nourishment project. Fifty-seven species representing 30 families were collected during the course of the study. Over 90% of each sampling period's catch was composed of five taxa or less. These taxa included Atlantic and rough silversides, Menidia menidia and Membras martinica, bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix, and bay and striped anchovies, Anchoa mitchilli and Anchoa hepsetus, with the relative contributions of these taxa varying among years. Both bluefish and anchovy abundances varied by an order of magnitude among years. Size-frequency distributions indicate summer-spawned bluefish recruit to the surf zone habitat as two cohorts in August and October, respectively. Fish abundance and richness were greater at substations closest to rock groins. Taxonomic richness declined along with decreasing water temperature in the fall, but was not correlated with turbidity or tide stage (measured as minutes before or after low tide). The extensive sampling effort undertaken in this study, 2190 seine hauls that captured 295 868 fish, was examined in relation to the number and relative proportions of taxa collected. Species accumulation curves and percent similarity calculations were used to investigate the adequacy of a reduced sampling protocol in characterizing the taxonomic composition of the surf zone fish community. Calculations from eight complete sampling periods (84 seine hauls each) indicate that a reduction in sampling effort by one-half would have yielded on average 75% of the total number of species captured with approximately 85% similarity in relative species composition."
1511,2011,Impacts of the Brown Tree Snake: Patterns of Decline and Species Persistence in Guam’s Avifauna,"Predation by brown tree snakes (Boiga irregularis) devastated the avifauna of Guam in the Mariana Islands during the last half of the twentieth century, causing the extirpation or serious reduction of most of the island's 25 resident bird species. Past studies have provided qualitative descriptions of the decline of native forest birds but have not considered all species or presented quantitative analyses. We analyzed two sets of survey data gathered in northern Guam between 1976 and 1998 and reviewed unpublished sources to provide a comprehensive account of the impact of brown tree snakes on the island's birds. Our results indicate that 22 species, including 17 of 18 native species, were severely affected by snakes. Twelve species were likely extirpated as breeding residents on the main island, 8 others experienced declines of ≥90% throughout the island or at least in the north, and 2 were kept at reduced population levels during all or much of the study. Declines of ≥90% occurred rapidly, averaging just 8.9 years along three roadside survey routes combined and 1.6 years at a 100-ha forested study site. Declines in northern Guam were also relatively synchronous and occurred from about 1976 to 1986 for most species. The most important factor predisposing a species to coexistence with brown tree snakes was its ability to nest and roost at locations where snakes were uncommon. Large clutch size and large body size were also related to longer persistence times, although large body size appeared to delay, but not prevent, extirpation. Our results draw attention to the enormous detrimental impact that brown tree snakes are likely to have upon invading new areas. Increased containment efforts on Guam are needed to prevent further colonizations, but a variety of additional management efforts would also benefit the island's remaining bird populations."
1512,4062,Cost-effective abundance estimation of rare animals: Testing performance of small-boat surveys for killer whales in British Columbia,"Top predators are often rare, subject to anthropogenic mortality, and possess life-history traits that make them inherently vulnerable to extinction. IUCN criteria recognise populations as Critically Endangered when abundance is <250 mature individuals, but estimating abundance of rare species can be more challenging than for common ones. Cost-effective methods are needed to provide robust abundance estimates. In marine environments, small boats are more widely accessible than large ships for researchers conducting sightings surveys with limited funds, but studies are needed into efficacy of small-boat surveys. This study compares line transect and mark-recapture estimates from small-boat surveys in summer 2004 and 2005 for northern resident killer whales in British Columbia to true population size, known from censuses conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The line transect estimate of 195 animals (95% CI 27559) used model averaging to incorporate uncertainty in the detection function, while the mark-recapture estimate of 239 animals (CI 154370) used a simple two-sample Chapman estimator. Both methods produced estimates close to the true population size, which numbered 219 animals in 2004 and 235 in 2006, but both suffered from the small sample sizes and violations of some model assumptions that will vex most pilot studies of rare species. Initial abundance estimates from relatively low-cost surveys can be thought of as hypotheses to be tested as new data are collected. For species of conservation concern, any cost-effective attempt to estimate absolute abundance will assist status assessments, as long as estimates are presented with appropriate caveats."
1513,4474,The distribution of chondrichthyans along the northern coast of Norway,"The relationship between temperature, latitude, and depth and the distribution and relative abundance of chondrichthyans along the northern coast of Norway was examined based on catches made in scientific trawls north of 62°N from 1992 to 2005. It appears that Chimaera monstrosa, Etmopterus spinax, Squalus acanthias, and Galeus melastomus were more abundant in the south, and Amblyraja radiata more common in the north. Between 1992 and 2005, the distribution and relative abundance did not appear to change significantly, although average water temperatures rose during the period. Current fishing levels do not appear to be impacting the populations of the more common species, but the status of species rarely found in the survey catches is unclear."
1514,959,The Land-Bird Community of Skokholm: Ordination and Turnover,"Records are available of the breeding of 29 species over 47 years, with counts for most species in most years from this Welsh island of 1 ${\rm km}^{2}$. The missing values are interpolated. Immigration and extinction affect primarily the casual breeders. Four species have established appreciable populations, all apparently reflecting national trends. The plot of immigration shows no relationship to species number, and considerable scatter. The plot of extinction also shows much scatter, but has a significant relationship with species number. Most of the turnover treated by MacArthur-Wilson theory is ecologically trivial. A new ordination technique, called step-along, which uses both variation in abundance, and absence records, brings out the spasmodic but persistent change in the community in time, and also the clear relationship of the early and late years. While the cause of this relationship is not known, the step-along technique quantifies the effect."
1515,1727,Birds of a central São Paulo woodlot: 1. Censuses 1982-2000. ,"Some 263 birds were recorded near and in a 230-ha patch of semideciduous forest in cane fields of central São Paulo, Brazil. Subtracting 67 open-area species, 22 of marshes or creeks, 10 vagrants and 12 recorded later, 152 forest and border species were recorded in 1982-86, much like what was observed in a similar woodlot near Campinas. Both woodlots lost species gradually over the years. Some birds avoided hard cane-field edges, preferring soft bushy edges. Of open-area species, 22 seemed to have disappeared by 1997 due to earlier high El Niño rains or rare permanently open habitats in the sugar cane; 17 new species were mostly nocturnal ones not noted earlier, or occasional visitors. Forest and borders lost 31 species, gaining five of dry regions and one winter visitor. Several migrants from the south appeared only in wet years before recent greenhouse effects, some resident birds were hunted, and canopy hummingbirds were perhaps still present. Dry-forest travel-prone or ""metapopulational"" species moved their centers of distribution, partly concealing loss of moist-forest diversity."
1516,4420,"Long-term fluctuations in distribution and populations of a threatened rodent (Pseudomys novaehollandiae) in coastal woodlands of the Otway Ranges, Victoria: a regional decline or extinction?","Since European settlement Australian native rodents have experienced dramatic extinctions and declines. We investigated long-term population and distribution changes during 1981-2003, and known or potential causal factors of decline in the vulnerable New Holland mouse (Pseudomys novaehollandiae). We found that populations (n = 8) were extant for 1-6 years and were predominantly small, localised and extinction prone. High-density populations occurred after above-average rainfall but declined precipitously during drought. Wildfire resulted in the extirpation of some populations, while others survived in unburnt refugia. We propose that post-fire vegetation (3-7 years) contemporaneous with above-average rainfall delivered productive habitat resulting in both a population irruption, and recovery after wildfire. Population declines occurred in drought periods. Recent trapping at 42 sites (2013-17) failed to record any New Holland mice. The species has not been recorded since 2003. Recovery is unlikely without intensive management, focussed on remnant or reintroduced populations, including protection from habitat fragmentation and inappropriate fire regimes. Prevention of extinction of the species throughout its southern range will require similar management strategies."
1517,1463,"Distribution and status of feral wild boar Sus scrofa in Dorset, southern England.","A recently established feral population of wild boar Sus scrofa in Dorset, southern England, was studied by collecting details of escapes, live sightings and animals killed, by examining field signs and by making direct observations in the field. Records were obtained from 47 national grid kilometre squares. Two or more records were received for 27 km2 and the presence of boar confirmed by field signs in 21 of these. The population appears to have originated from escapes in winter 1994/95 and to have remained largely confined to within 11 km of the escape site. The large number of animals killed, relative to the number of animals which escaped, reports of shot sows carrying foetuses and observations of sows with piglets in the field, confirmed that breeding had taken place. Estimates of live weight, estimated age, or descriptions of the animals killed were used to allocate each to a broad age class and thus construct a retrospective census. This suggested that the minimum population size peaked at about 30 animals in 1998 but that the prebreeding population has probably remained at fewer than 20 animals."
1518,3076,"Analyzing variability and the rate of decline of migratory shorebirds in Moreton Bay, Australia","Estimating the abundance of migratory species is difficult because sources of variability differ substantially among species and populations. Recently developed state-space models address this variability issue by directly modeling both environmental and measurement error, although their efficacy in detecting declines is relatively untested for empirical data. We applied state-space modeling, generalized least squares (with autoregression error structure), and standard linear regression to data on abundance of wetland birds (shorebirds and terns) at Moreton Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia. There are internationally significant numbers of 8 species of waterbirds in the bay, and it is a major terminus of the large East Asian-Australasian Flyway. In our analyses, we considered 22 migrant and 8 resident species. State-space models identified abundances of 7 species of migrants as significantly declining and abundance of one species as significantly increasing. Declines in migrant abundance over 15 years were 43-79%. Generalized least squares with an autoregressive error structure showed abundance changes in 11 species, and standard linear regression showed abundance changes in 15 species. The higher power of the regression models meant they detected more declines, but they also were associated with a higher rate of false detections. If the declines in Moreton Bay are consistent with trends from other sites across the flyway as a whole, then a large number of species are in significant decline. "
1519,3980,"Population dynamics of small mammals in relation to production of cones in four types of forests in the northern Sierra Nevada, California","We studied assemblages of small mammals in four types of coniferous forest (white fir, red; fir, mixed-fir, and pine-cedar) in the Sierra Nevada of California for 2 field seasons (20032004). We; assessed production of cones by dominant species of conifers in both years. Production of cones was; greater overall in autumn 2003, but varied within type of forest and between species of conifers. Parallel; to this, mean maximum densities of North American deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus) increased in; 2004 (from 0.77.3 individuals/ha to 65.7112.7 individuals/ha). Size of populations of golden-mantled; ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) were similar in both years; typical of hibernating species, this; taxon occurred at low densities in May (6.6 6 0.2), peak densities were in September (24.532.5; individuals/ha), and their populations declined in October (9.2 6 4.8). Long-eared chipmunks (Tamias; quadrimaculatus) reached higher densities in red fir (48.2 6 13.4 individuals/ha) and mixed-fir forests; (36.0 6 13.5 individuals/ha) than in white fir forests (7.6 6 2.7 individuals/ha), and all populations; peaked in September. Shadow chipmunks (Tamias senex) remained at lower densities than T.; quadrimaculatus except during September 2004, when they reached high densities (54.6 6 26.8; individuals/ha). Survival of P. maniculatus was dependant on an interaction between type of forest and; month, with additive effects of over-winter survival and mean production of cones in autumn 2003.; Survival of S. lateralis varied by month, whereas survival in both species of Tamias varied with the; interaction of type of forest and month, plus additional effects of over-winter survival and mean; production of cones for T. quadrimaculatus. Dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) were present at; lower elevations and reached greatest densities in pine-cedar forests. Northern flying squirrels; (Glaucomys sabrinus) were not captured commonly, and they occurred predominantly in red fir forests."
1520,1246,Adélie penguin population change in the pacific sector of Antarctica: relation to sea-ice extent and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.,"One of the longest continuing data Sets involving a marine organism in the Antarctic is that of annual estimates of breeding population size of Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae at colonies on Ross Island, Ross Sea, 1959 to 1997. The sizes of these colonies have displayed significant interannual variability during the 29-yr period. We hypothesized that changes are related to natural environmental factors; and used path analysis to analyze annual variation in population growth in relation to physical environmental factors during that part of the record with comparable sea-ice satellite imagery from 1973 to 1997. The Ross Sea sector of the Southern Ocean lying north of Ross Island, from 150°E to 130°W, comprised our study area. Annual population growth measured during summer was explained best, and inversely, by the extent of sea-ice in the study area 5 winters earlier, and in some way related to the Southern Oscillation. Analysis of a subset of the sea-ice data from 1979 to 1997 indicated strong correlations to ice conditions in the eastern portion of the study area (174 to 130°W), and virtually no correlations to the western half (150°E to 175°W). This result supported other indirect evidence that the Ross Island penguins winter in the eastern Ross Sea/western Amundsen Sea. A demographic model indicated that variation in survival of juveniles and subadults might account for the observed population variation, and would also explain the 5-yr lag as 5 yr is the average age of recruitment to the summer breeding population. Extensive sea-ice during winter appears to reduce subadult survival, expressed subsequently when these cohorts reach maturation. We hypothesize that extensive (more northerly) sea-ice limits access of penguins to productive waters known to occur south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, with starvation or increased predation disproportionately affecting less-experienced birds. The observed patterns of penguin population change, including those preceding the satellite era, imply that sea-ice extent has changed significantly over recent decades."
1521,3723,Factors influencing emigration of Ross's geese and snow geese from an Arctic breeding area,"Emigration is one of the most difficult demographic rates to estimate, yet understanding movement among populations has important consequences for wildlife conservation. We studied factors that affected emigration by adult Rosss geese (Chen rossii) and lesser snow geese (C. caerulescens caerulescens) during a demographic study from 1997 to 2013 of nesting geese at the Karrak Lake colony south of Queen Maud Gulf in the Central Canadian Arctic. Rising abundance of both species in recent decades has led to concerns about their impacts on Arctic ecosystems. We used Burnhams model to estimate true survival and fidelity (i.e., the complement of emigration). Mean estimates of fidelity were higher for Rosss geese (male¼0.910.02, female¼0.950.01) than for snow geese (male¼0.760.02, female¼0.900.02). Fidelity declined with prior nesting season abundance in both species with evidence that a reduction in population size led to greater fidelity in the following year. Fidelity was positively influenced by mean nest success in the previous year with similar responses by both species. However, years of low nest success were more frequent for snow geese resulting in higher emigration. We expected that deeper snow before nesting would motivate greater emigration but found the opposite effect in both species, suggesting that individuals may be discouraged from dispersing in snow-covered landscapes. We also tested whether a large decline in the number of snow geese nesting at Karrak Lake in 20072008 was related to a mass emigration event but found no evidence for a change in fidelity in these years. Moreover, survival of both species showed an increasing trend from 1997 to 2013 so the decline in nesting snow geese likely was an outcome of temporary non-breeding, rather than emigration or death. The destination of emigrants remains unknown, but we expect this movement has broader consequences for metapopulation dynamics of light geese across the central Arctic."
1522,2578,"Snake assemblage in a disturbed grassland environment in Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil: population fluctuations of Liophis poecilogyrus and Pseudablabes agassizii","A mark-recapture study of a snake assemblage using pitfall traps with drift fences was carried out in a disturbed grassland environment (e.g. cattle breeding and cultivations), located in the Pampa Biome, in the central region of the Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil. From February 2001 to January 2004 we caught 272 snakes belonging to 20 species from the following families: Elapidae (5%), Viperidae (10%), and Colubridae (85%). The assemblage had a unimodal seasonal pattern of activity, and the highest number of captures occurred between September and May. There was a positive and significant correlation between the number of captures and monthly minimum and maximum average temperatures. Recruitment was observed from January to April. During the study, the area was affected by human activities, which altered the community structure: Pseudablabes agassizii was negatively affected by habitat devastation while Liophis poecilogyrus took advantage of this. Our results reinforced the impression that Pseudablabes agassizii is a habitat specialist species. We extend the understanding of the susceptibility of this species to environmental destruction in open natural environments of South America, and propose its use as a potential bio-indicator of the Pampa biome. We also discuss the importance of conservation strategies for snakes in grasslands of southern Brazil."
1523,1983,"Enigmatic decline of a protected population of eastern kingsnakes, Lampropeltis getula, in South Carolina","Although recent reports of global amphibian declines have received considerable attention, reptile declines have gone largely unreported. Among reptiles, snakes are particularly difficult to quantitatively sample, and thus, most reports of snake declines are based on qualitative or anecdotal evidence. Recently, several sources have suggested that Eastern Kingsnakes (Lampropeltis getula) have declined over a substantial portion of their range in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida. However, published evidence for L. getula declines or their potential causes are limited. We monitored the status of a population of L. getula on the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) in Aiken, South Carolina, USA, from 1975 to 2006. Herpetofaunal populations on the Savannah River Site have been protected from the pressures of collecting and development since 1951 due to site access restrictions. Here, we document a decline in both abundance and body condition of L. getula inhabiting the vicinity of a large isolated wetland over the past three decades. Because this L. getula population was protected from anthropogenic habitat degradation, collection, and road mortality, we are able to exclude these factors as possible causes of the documented decline. Although the definitive cause of the decline remains enigmatic, natural succession of the surrounding uplands, periodic extreme droughts, shifts in community composition (e.g., increased Agkistrodon piscivorus abundance), introduced fire ants, or disease are all potential contributors to the decline."
1524,3520,Relative abundance and distribution of Common snook along shoreline habitats of Florida estuaries,"Quantitative estimates of relative abundance, spatial and temporal distribution, and habitat preference of common snook Centropomus undecimalis along shoreline habitats in four Florida estuarine areas were determined. Significant differences in the relative abundance of common snook among the estuarine areas suggested marked variation in common snook population abundance and densities on a regional scale. The highest adjusted mean relative abundance of common snook occurred in the southern Indian River Lagoon (4.68 fish/haul; SE = 0.08), followed by Tampa Bay (3.36 fish/haul; SE = 0.11), Charlotte Harbor (2.13 fish/haul; SE = 0.10), and the northern Indian River Lagoon (0.76 fish/haul; SE = 0.21). Several common factors (e.g., mangrove and seagrass habitat, salinity, and water temperature) among the estuarine areas were linked with common snook relative abundance and distributions, allowing us to better understand how these fish interact with their environment in different regions of Florida.

1525,3844,Comparative Demography of an At-Risk African Elephant Population,"Knowledge of population processes across various ecological and management settings offers important insights for species conservation and life history. In regard to its ecological role, charisma and threats from human impacts, African elephants are of high conservation concern and, as a result, are the focus of numerous studies across various contexts. Here, demographic data from an individually based study of 934 African elephants in Samburu, Kenya were summarized, providing detailed inspection of the population processes experienced by the population over a fourteen year period (including the repercussions of recent increases in illegal killing). These data were compared with those from populations inhabiting a spectrum of xeric to mesic ecosystems with variable human impacts. In relation to variability in climate and human impacts (causing up to 50% of recorded deaths among adults), annual mortality in Samburu fluctuated between 1 and 14% and, unrelatedly, natality between 2 and 14% driving annual population increases and decreases. Survivorship in Samburu was significantly lower than other populations with age-specific data even during periods of low illegal killing by humans, resulting in relatively low life expectancy of males (18.9 years) and females (21.8 years). Fecundity (primiparous age and inter-calf interval) were similar to those reported in other human impacted or recovering populations, and significantly greater than that of comparable stable populations. This suggests reproductive effort of African savanna elephants increases in relation to increased mortality (and resulting ecological ramifications) as predicted by life history theory. Further comparison across populations indicated that elongated inter-calf intervals and older ages of reproductive onset were related to age structure and density, and likely influenced by ecological conditions. This study provides detailed empirical data on elephant population dynamics strongly influenced by human impacts (laying the foundation for modeling approaches), supporting predictions of evolutionary theory regarding demographic responses to ecological processes."
1526,1939,"Demographic status of elephants in the Samburu and Buffalo Springs National Reserves, Kenya","Individual based demographic records of the elephants utilizing Samburu and Buffalo Springs National Reserves were collected from 1998 through 2003 and indicate that this elephant population was increasing at an average rate of 4.6% per year. Although the majority of carcasses were not found, known sources of mortality include disease, injury, and predation by lions and humans. Poaching did occur during the study period, however the population is increasing and thus our findings indicate ivory poaching has limited impact on the demographic status of these elephants. This population is part of the Samburu/Laikipia MIKE Site and thus its status is relevant to CITES ligislation."
1527,2719,Learning to count: adapting population monitoring for Endangered huemul deer Hippocamelus bisulcus to meet conservation objectives,"Considerable efforts have been invested in recent years to improve methods for both data collection and analyses required for population monitoring. Where historical or current estimates of population size are not adjusted for detection probabilities they may be too inaccurate to provide meaningful estimates of trends and thus monitoring methods need to be adapted. Here, we use data from the Endangered huemul deer Hippocamelus bisulcus to outline a framework to develop accurate robust estimates of detection probabilities that can be incorporated into new surveys in a cost-effective way and applied to existing survey data sets. In particular, by retroactively estimating detection probabilities for surveys of huemul, we show that current survey methods for huemul are inadequate to determine population trends reliably. Based on these results we propose a new monitoring method for the huemul and discuss the importance of estimating accuracies of historical survey data to ensure that changes in the abundance of the species reflect real population trends and are not an artefact of variation over time in the accuracy of survey data.

1528,907,"Long-term population increase of black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys at Heard Island, 1947/1948 – 2000/2001","The breeding population of the black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys has increased at Heard Island since the first census data were obtained in 1947/1948. Four breeding localities are known, and all populations have increased in the period 1947/1948-2000/2001. The breeding population is estimated to have been approximately 200 pairs in 1947/1948. Based on 2000/2001 census data, the population has increased to a minimum of approximately 600 pairs over the 53 years. Two mechanisms, that of increased prey availability through scavenging discards from trawlers operating within their foraging range, and climatic amelioration, are proposed as hypotheses for this increase."

1530,1039,"The distribution, abundance and status of Adelie Penguins Pygoscelis adeliae at the Windmill Islands, Wilkes Land, Antarctica.","The total breeding population of Adelie penguins at the Windmill Islands region in 1989/90 was 93 092±9300 pairs at 14 breeding localities. The population has apparently increased by 209% since a survey in the early 1960s, a trend shared with many other breeding localities where long-term data are available. Relict colony areas (former breeding sites) were identified at all but two localities currently supporting breeding colonies. The population on Shirley Island, near Casey Station, increased between 1961/62 and 1968/69, but has remained stable since 1968/69, coincident with the opening of Casey Station. The lack of growth in the breeding population is likely to be a result of disturbance by visitors to the island. -Authors"
1531,4421,"Monitoring indicates rapid and severe decline of native small mammals in Kakadu National Park, northern Australia","Context. Australia has a lamentable history of mammal extinctions. Until recently, the mammal fauna of northern Australia was presumed to have been spared such loss, and to be relatively intact and stable. However, several recent studies have suggested that this mammal fauna may be undergoing some decline, so a targeted monitoring program was; established in northern Australias largest and best-resourced conservation reserve.; Aims. The present study aims to detect change in the native small-mammal fauna of Kakadu National Park, in the monsoonal tropics of northern Australia, over the period of 19962009, through an extensive monitoring program, and to consider factors that may have contributed to any observed change.; Methods. The small-mammal fauna was sampled in a consistent manner across a set of plots established to represent the environmental variation and fire regimes of Kakadu. Fifteen plots were sampled three times, 121 plots sampled twice and 39 plots once. Resampling was typically at 5-yearly intervals. Analysis used regression (of abundance against date), and; Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests to assess change. For resampled plots, change in abundance of mammals was related to fire frequency in the between-sampling period.; Key results. A total of 25 small mammal species was recorded. Plot-level species richness and total abundance decreased significantly, by 54% and 71%, respectively, over the course of the study. The abundance of 10 species declined significantly, whereas no species increased in abundance significantly. The number of empty plots increased from 13% in 1996 to 55% in 2009. For 136 plots sampled in 200104 and again in 200709, species richness declined by 65% and the total number of individuals declined by 75%. Across plots, the extent of decline increased with increasing frequency of fire. The most marked declines were for northern quoll, Dasyurus hallucatus, fawn antechinus, Antechinus bellus, northern brown bandicoot, Isoodon macrourus, common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, and pale fieldrat, Rattus tunneyi.; Conclusions. The native mammal fauna of Kakadu National Park is in rapid and severe decline. The cause(s) of this decline are not entirely clear, and may vary among species. The most plausible causes are too frequent fire, predation by feral cats and invasion by cane toads (affecting particularly one native mammal species).; Implications. The present study has demonstrated a major decline in a key conservation reserve, suggesting that the mammal fauna of northern Australia may now be undergoing a decline comparable to the losses previously occurring elsewhere in Australia. These results suggest that there is a major and urgent conservation imperative to more precisely identify, and more effectively manage, the threats to this mammal fauna."
1532,4038,"Conservation status and reintroduction of the Cocos Buff-banded Rail, Gallirallus philippensis andrewsi","An endemic subspecies of Buff-banded Rail (Gallirallus philippensis) is restricted to the Cocos (Keeling); Islands, a group of 27 islands, with total area of ~15 km2, in the north-eastern Indian Ocean. Human settlement led to; marked environmental degradation of the 26 islands in the southern atoll of the group. The Cocos Buff-banded Rail; declined severely, with the last confirmed record from islands in the southern atoll in 1991. The subspecies has persisted,; however, with a population of ~800 individuals, on a single island, Pulu Keeling, 24 km north of the southern atoll.; A recovery plan for this endangered subspecies recommended reintroduction to a suitable island in the southern atoll.; This paper provides a brief overview of the history and status of the subspecies, and describes an April 2013 reintroduction of; 39 rails from Pulu Keeling to the 1-km2 Horsburgh Island in the southern atoll. This program has had at least short-term; success, with monitoring showing successful recruitment in the reintroduced population, and its increase to ~54 individuals; by October 2014 and ~121 individuals by June 2015. Much of the worlds loss of biodiversity has been from, and continues; to occur on, islands: this project demonstrates that well-considered mitigation of threats and translocation programs can; provide solutions to this challenge."
1533,2107,Population size and density of Colobus vellerosus at the Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary and surrounding forest fragments in Ghana,"The Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary (BFMS) is inhabited by a growing population of Ursine colobus (Colobus vellerosus), a species that is listed as vulnerable. Smaller, degraded forest fragments that surround the BFMS also contain C. vellerosus and may provide an important habitat for the monkeys. Our objectives were to 1) determine the current population size and density of C. vellerosus at BFMS and in five surrounding fragments, 2) examine the differences in demographics between the fragments and BFMS, and 3) determine whether a relationship exists between population density and fragment size and isolation distance from BFMS. The census was a complete count and was conducted for 1 month (July 2003) by S.W. and trained research assistants. Seven census routes were walked simultaneously on 13 days. The 2003 population estimate of C. vellerosus at BFMS was 217-241 individuals (15 groups), a slight increase from the 2000 census. Numbers in the fragments (58-62, six groups) have remained stable since 1997, when the only other census of these fragments was conducted. Mean group size did not differ between the fragments and BFMS. Larger fragments had larger numbers of colobus, but there was no relationship between fragment size and colobus density. Isolation distance had no effect on population density. Our data suggest that colobus probably travel between fragments. Conservation efforts should focus on treating the small forests and their connecting areas as a single conservation unit."
1534,902,Conserving the African wild dog Lycaon pictus. I. Diagnosing and treating causes of decline,"The African wild dog Lycaon pictus has declined dramatically over the past 30 years. Formerly distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa; today c. 5000 wild dogs remain in total, mostly in southern and eastern Africa. Wild dogs' decline reflects the expansion of human populations and the associated fragmentation of habitat available to wildlife. Because wild dogs live at very low densities, even 'fragments' covering thousands of square kilometres may not support viable populations. Furthermore, packs often range beyond the borders of reserves, so even nominally protected populations are often subject to persecution, road accidents, snaring and disease contracted from domestic dogs. Such edge effects mean that reserves smaller than c. 10,000 sq km will provide only incomplete protection. The highest priority for wild dog conservation, therefore, is to maintain and promote the contiguity of areas available to wildlife. Establishing cross-border parks and buffer zones, and encouraging game ranching on reserve borders, will all be beneficial. In smaller areas, protecting wild dogs requires that edge effects be mitigated by: (i) working with local farmers to limit persecution; (ii) controlling snaring; (iii) routing roads carrying high-speed traffic away from wildlife areas; and (iv) minimizing contact between wildlife and domestic dogs. Most of these measures will also benefit other wildlife."
1535,1429,The Impact of Hurricane Hugo on Forest Frogs in Puerto Rico.,"Hurricane Hugo caused extensive damage to the Luquillo Experimental Forest in September 1989. Individually marked Eleutherodactylus coqui were monitored in two study plots from January 1987 through October 1990. Survivorship estimates of adults for the period including the storm were within the normal range from previous years. Juveniles suffered severe reductions, primarily among the smaller size classes. By October 1990 adult population density had increased fourfold over prehurricane levels, although adults were smaller. Juvenile numbers also appeared to be increasing, but had not yet reached prehurricane densities. The rapid increase in density may have resulted from an increase in retreat sites and a decrease in invertebrate predators. Density changes for other species ranged from a 14% increase for the relatively common E. hedricki to an 83% decrease for the relatively rare E. richmondi. -from Author"
1536,3165,"Numbers and distribution of Bewick’s Swan Cygnus columbianus bewickii wintering in Britain and Ireland: results of international censuses, January 1995, 2000 and 2005","The total size of the Northwest European population of Bewick's Swan Cygnus columbianus bewickii is monitored at 5-year intervals by a coordinated midwinter census throughout the swans' wintering range. This paper presents the results of three censuses undertaken in Britain and Ireland between 1995 and 2005, with a particular focus on changes in abundance and distribution. A total of 7,563 Bewick's Swans were counted in Britain and Ireland during January 1995, 7,597 in January 2000 and 7,216 in January 2005, representing a 4.6% decrease in numbers between 1995 and 2005. Numbers in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland decreased dramatically over the period, and declines also occurred in several counties in the west of England. Eastern England consistently held the largest concentrations of Bewick's Swans in Britain and Ireland, increasing by 7% between 1995 and 2005. Southeast England also saw an increase in numbers, supporting the possibility of an eastward contraction of range. The percentage of cygnets recorded in flocks in Britain and Ireland was 11.5% during January 1995, 7.6% in January 2000 and 14.4% in January 2005; mean brood size was similar in these years, ranging between 1.97 and 1.98 cygnets per successful pair. Over 90% of birds were recorded on farmland, most of which were on arable land: 58% in 1995, 87% in 2000 and 86% in 2005. Analysis of data from across Europe is needed to determine whether declining numbers in parts of Britain and Ireland reflect a shift in winter distribution or a decrease in total population size for Bewick's Swans in Northwest Europe.

1537,4618,"Long term changes in the fish assemblage of Sulaibikhat Bay, Kuwait","Between February 1986 and July 1990, a total of 47,761 fish representing 70 species from 38 families were captured using an otter trawl in Sulaibikhat Bay, Kuwait. Young of the year dominated the catches. The assemblage can be characterised by depth and season, with depth made up of intertidal and subtidal. Seasons consisted of winter, spring and summer. The 20 most numerous species can be placed into several categories with typical examples as follows: regular species are: Leiognathus decorus (de Vis); spring and summer intertidal species Liza carinata (Valenciennes); irregular species Terapon puta (Cuvier) and subtidal species Solea elongata (Day). Fish abundance data showed considerable variation between years. The long-term dominant species, Leiognathus decorus (de Vis), unlike most other species reported here, was present in all life history stages and in consistent numbers every year. The two numerical dominants, Liza carinata and Pomadasys stridens (Forsskal), showed marked between-year differences in numbers, being present in large numbers in one year only."
1538,2088,"Importance of climatic and environmental change in the demography of a multi-brooded passerine, the woodlark Lullula arborea","1. We examined the influence of local weather conditions on reproductive success, timing of breeding and survival in a population of a multi-brooded ground nesting passerine (woodlark Lullula arborea) over 35 years. 2. Woodlarks laid larger clutches when rainfall was low and temperature high during the egg-laying and pre-laying period. Nest success increased with higher temperatures during the nesting period. In successful nests, the number of chicks fledged per egg laid was greater when weather was drier during the brood stage. 3. Although woodlarks bred earlier in years with warmer early spring temperatures, with the onset of breeding varying by 25 days, there was no significant advance in the onset of breeding over the 35 years of study, due to considerable inter-annual variability, and no overall trend, in weather. 4. Simulation modelling of annual reproductive output demonstrated that earlier breeding could increase productivity by 235% in the warmest compared to the coldest year, due to birds having more nesting attempts. Other effects of weather on productivity affected breeding output to a lesser extent. 5. Effects of weather on productivity were minor compared to an increased rate of nest predation through the period of study, which reduced productivity by 498% by 2004 compared to 1971. 6. Turning points analysis identified three distinct demographic periods: from1971 to 1988 the population grew slowly, during 1988-1999 the population grew rapidly, but after 1999 the population declined. Increased population growth after 1988 was associated with higher first-year survival rates (estimated using a population model). Population decline after 1999 was caused by a combination of reduced productivity (resulting from increased nest failure rates attributed to predation) and lower first-year survival rates, that appear unrelated to winter temperature. 7. Climate change (long-term changes in weather) did not explain the marked changes observed in the population trajectory over 35 years. We suggest that understanding effects of both climate and habitat change on populations is essential in predictive population modelling. "
1539,3981,"The El Niño Southern Oscillation, Variable Fruit Production, and Famine in a Tropical Forest","We tested the hypothesis that the El Nifio Southern Oscillation influences forest-wide fruit production, which, in turn, limits frugivorous and granivorous mammals on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Observations of BCI mammals have been com- piled for 49 years. Frugivorous mammals experienced famine between September and January in 1931-1932, 1958-1959, 1970-1971, and 1993-1994. The most recent famine is evident from an 1 1-yr record of natural deaths of mammals and a 2-yr record of population densities. Famine occurred every time a mild dry season followed an El Ninio event in the 49-yr record. This coincidence is statistically improbable, as demonstrated by a random- ization test. A 2-yr cycle of high, then low community-level fruit production has been observed twice for BCI when a mild dry season followed an El Nifio event. We used 260 litter traps to monitor community- and species-level fruit production from 1 January 1987 through 30 June 1996. Community-level fruit production was greatest during the 1992 El Nifio event and lowest one year later, after the mild 1993 dry season. We also reinterpret an earlier 2-yr record of fruit production in light of our 9.5-yr record of fruit production. Community- level fruit production was elevated during the 1969 El Niiio event and was very low one year later, after the mild 1970 dry season. We hypothesize that (1) El Nifio conditions enhance fruit production; (2) high fruit production consumes stored reserves, limiting the next reproductive event; and (3) mild dry seasons reduce fruit production. Each plant species may respond to any combination of the three components of this hypothesis. Community- level fruit production is extremely low when species sensitive to components 1 and 2 are entrained with species sensitive to component 3, or when a mild dry season follows one year after an El Niflo event. El Niiio events bring dry, sunny conditions to BCI and a large portion of the wet tropics. Drought and sun may both favor fruit production in wet tropical forests. Drought is known to synchronize flowering, and sunny conditions may relieve light limitation. The El Niiio Southern Oscillation has a strong 24-mo periodicity. This creates a strong tendency for dry, sunny years to alternate with wet, cloudy years in Central America and elsewhere in the tropics. We present evidence that this alternately enhances and reduces fruit production on BCI. Terborgh hypothesized that predators regulate frugivorous mammals in tropical forests. As a corollary, he further hypothesized that famines occur on BCI because several large predators are absent and frugivores escape predation. We extended censuses to the nearby mainland to evaluate this hypothesis. Poachers, who are active on the mainland, reduce the abundances of game species below levels maintained in the presence of large felids and raptors. There was evidence for famine in poached, mainland populations, and we rejected the hypothesis that reduced predation pressure is a prerequisite for famine."
1540,4193,Yellow-naped Amazon Amazona auropalliata populations are markedly low and rapidly declining in Costa Rica and Nicaragua,"Summary Accurate assessments of population sizes and trends are fundamental for effective species conservation, particularly for social and long-lived species in which low reproductive rates, aging demographic structure and Allee effects could interact to drive rapid population declines. In the parrots (Order Psittaciformes) these life history characteristics have combined with habitat loss and capture for the pet trade to lead to widespread endangerment, with over 40% of species classified under some level of threat. Here we report the results of a population survey of one such species, the Yellow-naped Amazon, Amazona auropalliata, that is classified as 'Endangered' on the IUCN Red List. We conducted a comprehensive survey in June and July of 2016 of 44 night roosts of the populations in contiguous Pacific lowlands of northern Costa Rica and southern Nicaragua and compared numbers in Costa Rica to those found in a similar survey conducted in June 2005. In 2016 we counted 990 birds across 25 sites surveyed in Costa Rica and 692 birds across 19 sites surveyed in Nicaragua for a total population estimate of only 1,682 birds. Comparisons of 13 sites surveyed in both 2005 and 2016 in Costa Rica showed a strong and statistically significant decline in population numbers over the 11-year period. Assessment of group sizes approaching or leaving roosts indicated that less than 25% of groups consisted of three or more birds; there was a significantly higher proportion of these putative family groups observed in Nicaragua than Costa Rica. Taken together, these results are cause for substantial concern for the health of this species in a region that has previously been considered its stronghold, and suggest that stronger conservation action should be undertaken to protect remaining populations from capture for the pet trade and loss of key habitat."
1541,3803,"Factors affecting population dynamics of re-introduced mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella) in the Ibex Reserve, central Saudi Arabia","Mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) in Saudi Arabia is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. At present the species survival is secured by extensive captive-breeding programs and re-introductions into protected areas. Post-monitoring of released individuals is essential for evaluating the success of such re-introductions but managers have difficulties in deciding whether food, water and other resources are sufficient to sustain a stable population. This study reports on data collected during standardized road transect counts in two wadis of the Ibex Reserve into which gazelles were previously released, and aims to compare the success of both re-introduction attempts with resource availability and home range size. Results from step-wise backward multiple regressions identified food availability and population density as significant predictors for home range size. The low amount of available food may have increased the competition between non-related females and therefore led to an increased overlap between non-group members resulting in increased dispersal rates. This information will allow interpretation of habitat suitability and provides possible reasons for the population decrease at both study sites. The data will enable conservation mangers to identify future re-introduction sites and will help improving the success of future re-introductions in Saudi Arabia or other parts of the species range."
1542,3199,Long-term changes in numbers of geese stopping over and wintering in south-western Poland,"South-western Poland belongs to the key staging areas for geese in Europe, supporting some 100000 birds in recent years. We compared goose counts conducted in the 1970s, 1990s and during 2009-2011 in this region, and linked the findings to the recent assessments of trends in the flyway-populations. Numbers increased several dozen times between the first two counts and have stabilized to the present. More than 14% of the flyway Tundra Bean Goose (Anser fabalis rossicus) stopped over in SW Poland on passage. Smaller numbers of White-fronted Goose (A. albifrons), Greylag Goose (A. anser), and four other rarer species, have all increased since the 1970s. The likely factors responsible for these changes are mild weather conditions, increased availability of large water bodies and shifts in winter ranges of particular species. Temporal mismatch between SW Poland and the total flyways in Bean and White-fronted Geese was recorded when we compared the long-term and the short-term population trends. Increasing reports of other species in SW Poland match the general tendencies in Europe. These data document that regional trends are not a simple reflection of those in flyways as a whole. To understand changes in goose populations a re-established international count network is desired. "
1543,1633,Demography of an Increasing Population of Sparrowhawks,"Recolonization of the Rockingham Forest area, Northamptonshire, by Accipiter nisus was studied after the local population had been eliminated, almost certainly by organochlorine pesticides. Over a 10-yr period, nest numbers increased rapidly to begin with and then more slowly, with a mean rate of 21% per year. Over the whole 10 yr, annual survival of breeders was at least 76% for males and 74% for females. Mean productivity was 2.1 young per nest. Throughout, the breeding population contained a large proportion of first-year birds, with an overall figure of 35% of all male breeders and 25% of all female breeders. As the breeding population grew, young raised in the area tended to disperse ever greater distances from their natal sites. Comparison of the increasing population with stable and decreasing populations in S Scotland showed that differences in population trend were associated mainly with differences in the recruitment of new breeders (greatest in the increasing and lowest in the decreasing population) and in age of first breeding (earliest in the increasing and latest in the decreasing population). There were also differences in dispersal distances (shorter in the increasing population), and in the annual survival of breeders (greater in the increasing population). Differences in breeding success between areas were slight, and non-significant. -Authors"
1544,1669,Climate-driven range expansion of a critically endangered top predator in northeast Atlantic waters,"Global climate change is driving rapid distribution shifts in marine ecosystems; these are well established for lower trophic levels, but are harder to quantify for migratory top predators. By analysing a 25-year sightings-based dataset, we found evidence for rapid northwards range expansion of the critically endangered Balearic shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus in northeast Atlantic waters. A 0.68C sea surface temperature increase in the mid-1990s is interpreted as an underlying controlling factor, while simultaneous northward shifts of plankton and prey fish species suggests a strong bottom-up control. Our results have important conservation implications and provide new evidence for climate-driven regime shift in Atlantic ecosystems. "
1545,3959,Estimating abundance and density of Amur tigers along the Sino-Russian border,"As an apex predator the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) could play a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of forest ecosystems in Northeast Asia. Due to habitat loss and harvest over the past century, tigers rapidly declined in China and are now restricted to the Russian Far East and bordering habitat in nearby China. To facilitate restoration of the tiger in its historical range, reliable estimates of population size are essential to assess effectiveness of conservation interventions. Here we used camera trap data collected in Hunchun National Nature Reserve from April to June 2013 and 2014 to estimate tiger density and abundance using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian spatially explicit capturerecapture (SECR) methods. A minimum of 8 individuals were detected in both sample periods and the documentation of marking behavior and reproduction suggests the presence of a resident population. Using Bayesian SECR modeling within the 11 400 km2 state space, density estimates were 0.33 and 0.40 individuals/100 km2 in 2013 and 2014, respectively, corresponding to an estimated abundance of 38 and 45 animals for this transboundary SinoRussian population. In a maximum likelihood framework, we estimated densities of 0.30 and 0.24 individuals/100 km2 corresponding to abundances of 34 and 27, in 2013 and 2014, respectively. These density estimates are comparable to other published estimates for resident Amur tiger populations in the Russian Far East. This study reveals promising signs of tiger recovery in Northeast China, and demonstrates the importance of connectivity between the Russian and Chinese populations for recovering tigers in Northeast China.

1546,2408,The decline of the Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus in Greece,"                             The Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus is considered to be an endangered species in Greece. The latest estimate in the mid 80s gave a population of about 25 pairs distributed over an area of about 8000 km                             2                             . In an attempt to update our knowledge on the post-1980 distribution and status of the species, we gathered all bibliographical references for the period 1985-1999 and conducted a field survey (1995-2000) in almost all traditional territories. Results revealed that an 84% loss of the species’ population and a 75% shrinkage of its breeding distribution have taken place during the last decade. The present population consists of four breeding pairs that are distributed over 2000 km                             2                              in Crete or an estimated 25 individuals. Population decline has been most pronounced in the mainland (>90% loss), where only one pair seems to have been left in the borders with the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia. Poisoning and direct persecution seem to have had the most serious impact on the species’ decline. Conservation actions such as safeguarding of nesting areas and reduction of human persecution are urgently needed for the long-term survival of the Greek population of Bearded Vultures.

1547,3055,The effects of flooding on the spatial ecology of spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata) in a partially mined peatland,"Many studies have focused on the effects of anthropogenic habitat alterations on animals, but little attention has been; given to the effects of natural changes in habitat. The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of flooding; caused by Beaver (Castor canadensis) dams on the spatial ecology of the federally endangered Spotted Turtle (Clemmys; guttata), in a bog in Ontario that was historically drained for peat extraction. We hypothesized that home range sizes; and daily distances traveled would be greater after flooding and that habitat selection would change because turtles; would exploit the increase in aquatic habitats post-flooding. Using 12 years of markrecapture data, radio telemetry,; and GIS software, we compared movements and habitat selection before and after flooding. Distances traveled and; home range sizes were larger post-flood compared to pre-flood conditions, indicating that turtles were opportunistically; exploring the new aquatic habitat. During pre-flooding, turtles primarily selected the drainage ditches created; to facilitate peat extraction; these were the only aquatic habitat available. After flooding, there was a strong; preference for newly flooded areas and drainage ditches, showing that turtles exploited the increase in available; aquatic habitat. Our findings indicate that natural habitat alteration resulting from Beaver dam flooding may be; beneficial for Spotted Turtles, although observations also suggest that nesting habitat may be limited due to the; flooding, and further research is needed to determine the effect of the flooding on recruitment into the population."
1548,905,"A census of the eastern lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla graueri in Kahuzi-Biega National Park with reference to mountain gorillas G. g. beringei in the Virunga Region, Zaire","A population census of eastern lowland gorillas Gorilla gorilla graueri was conducted in the original part of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, Zaire. At least 258 gorillas (25 groups and nine solitary males) were estimated by bed counts to have survived within the Park in the 1990 bamboo season. In comparison with results of the previous censuses, conducted between 1978 and 1979, the population showed a slight increase. The percentage of immature individuals in the population indicates that gorillas still maintain a healthy population, but mean group size has decreased markedly. Although gorillas expanded their range in the 11 years between the surveys, they have still tended to concentrate in the central well-protected area of the Park, possibly stimulating frequent transfer of females between groups or from groups to solitary males, resulting in the decrease in group size. Recent social changes recorded from observations of habituated groups tend to support this interpretation. Human disturbance in the bridge zone between highland and lowland forests prevents gorillas from making contact with their neighbours and reduces the possibility of outbreeding within the Park. Reference is made to the more detailed censuses of the mountain gorilla G. g. beringei. More international attention will be needed to increase conservation activity to protect gorillas from the hazards of human disturbances in this area. "
1549,1919,"The numerical status of Gazella dorcas and Gazella gazella in the southern Negev Desert, Israel","Annual counts of Gazella gazella and Gazella dorcas were conducted in the southern Negev Desert of Israel during 1964-85. The Gazella dorcas population increased at an average annual rate of 9.05% near agricultural settlements and 3.8% in other areas (overall mean for the whole area was 7%). The total population size in 1985 was about 1100 animals. The Gazella gazella population decreased during the study period at an average annual rate of 0.65%. The total population size in 1985 was estimated at 27 animals. Possible reasons for the above population trends are discussed. It is suggested that a significant decrease in poaching and increased water and food availability near human settlements are responsible for the increase of G. dorcas, while increased interference from people, feral dogs and predators were the main factors causing the decrease of G. gazella."
1550,3922,"Fishing-induced groupers stock dynamics in Karimunjawa National Park, Indonesia","As a result of high levels of exploitation, in many regions of the world grouper (Epinephelidae) populations are at risk and/or declining steadily, such as in Indonesia. The aim of this study was to determine grouper stock sizes in Karimunjawa National Park, Indonesia. If the establishment of the park with no-take zones was effective in protecting grouper populations, the biomass of the grouper populations in this park should have increased or at least have been maintained between 2005 and 2012, the period under study. We found that grouper mean abundance declined between 2005 and 2012, with a fluctuating mean biomass, but that the mean biomass increased from 2009 to 2012. A significant difference was found in the abundance and biomass of groupers between the different core zones, but no significant difference was observed for three observed species between these zones. Three fishing gear types are used by fishermen to catch groupers, with speargun fisheries being the most effective. In 2011, the speargun effort was decreased, based on self-regulation by fishermen; this resulted in a change in the groupers target size and impacted recruitment success, with an increase in the stock size and biomass of groupers in 2012. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the establishment of marine protected areas alone, as exemplified by the establishment of three core zones in Karimunjawa National Park, is not sufficient on its own to protect natural populations of groupers, and that fishing-gear regulation and community support are also required."

The main factors responsible for the abrupt decline of the Bering Sea group between 2002 and 2004 are discussed. A statistically significant correlation has been revealed between fluctuations of sea otter abundance and the cycles of solar activity in the period since 1992. Changes in the age and sex structure of the insular groups of sea otters are evaluated.
1552,4612,"Temporal variability in fish assemblage structure and recruitment in a freshwater-deprived estuary: The Coorong, Australia","River regulation can diminish freshwater flows to estuaries and compromise estuarine functionality. Understanding biotic responses to altered flow regimes is imperative to effectively manage aquatic ecosystems. The present study investigated temporal variation in fish assemblage structure and the recruitment of catadromous fish in the Coorong estuary at the terminus of the Murray River, in south-eastern Australia. Over the three-year study period, freshwater inflows to the estuary diminished and ultimately ceased, disconnecting freshwater and estuarine environments. It was hypothesised that these conditions would lead to (1) increases in estuarine salinities and concomitant changes in fish assemblage structure and abundance, and (2) decreased recruitment of catadromous fish. As freshwater inflow decreased, salinities immediately downstream of a series of tidal barrages increased from brackish to marinehypersaline, species richness and diversity decreased, freshwater and diadromous species became less abundant and assemblages were increasingly characterised by marine species. Furthermore, the abundance of young-of-year catadromous fish decreased dramatically. Excessive regulation of freshwater inflows is resulting in the Coorong estuary resembling a marine embayment, leading to a loss in species diversity. We suggest, however, that even small volumes of freshwater may promote diversity in estuarine fish assemblages and some recruitment of catadromous species. "
1553,4530,,"The northern part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul was extensively deforested in recent decades, and only isolated fragments of the original vegetation remain. The Parque Natural Municipal de Sertão comprises a remnant of Atlantic Rain Forest, one of the largest fragments in northern Rio Grande do Sul. This study examined the diversity of the herpetofauna, focusing on environmental distribution, seasonality and species richness. We used complementary methods of sampling such as pitfall traps, active search and occasional encounters. We recorded 23 species of frogs, nine snakes and one lizard. With respect to the relationship between amphibians and reptiles and the structural and abiotic factors of the environment, the edge of the fragment showed higher richness and increased dominance of amphibians and reptiles than the interior. The highest amphibian abundances were found when the minimum temperatures were higher and maximum temperatures were lower. The abundance of snakes was correlated with humidity, and species richness was influenced by humidity and monthly average temperature. Our results reinforce the importance of the conservation of forested areas to the maintenance of the species."
1554,2791,"Distribution, status and conservation of Hainan Eld's deer (Cervus eldi hainanus) in China","Hainan Eld's deer (Cervus eldi hainanus) was once widely distributed in Hainan Island of China. With the rapid increase of human population and the fast expansion of agriculture in the recent 350 years of Chinese history, the habitat of the deer has been greatly reduced. Habitat loss and hunting have driven the deer to the verge of extinction. The last group of 26 deer was protected at Datian Nature Reserve (DNR) which was founded in 1976. The habitat at present remains only 13.14 km2 at DNR, just 4.38-6.57% of that of the 1950's. The deer population increased to over 1,000 individuals in 2003 under the protection of enclosure building along the boundary of DNR. Moreover, an off-site conservation approach for the deer has been launched since 1990. A total of 83 deer from DNR had been accumulatively introduced to establish off-site populations by the end of 2000. The off-site conserved populations had reached 263 by the end of 2002, of which 246 animals were born in captivity or semi-captivity. A new off-site population in the natural environment was founded by introducing 65 animals from DNR during July to December 2003. Tile deer population still however faces challenges of habitat limitation, decrease of genetic diversity, inbreeding and poaching. Conservation approaches needed to practice immediately have been proposed in this paper."
1555,3958,"Spatio-temporal dynamics in the location of the fishing grounds and catch per unit effort (CPUE) for Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi Nichols, 1920) from Chinese trawl fleets on the high seas of the Southeast Pacific Ocean, 2001–2010","The decadal spatio-temporal distribution of the fishing effort; and catch per unit effort (CPUE) for Chilean jack mackerel,; Trachurus murphyi, stock are poorly understood. Data from; the Chinese jack mackerel fleet was used to describe the location; of the fishing effort and the relationship between standardized; CPUE and sea surface temperatures (SST) during; the period 20012010. A significant change in the spatio-temporal; distribution of fishing effort and standardized CPUE; was observed for jack mackerel during the study period.; From January to March, the average CPUE was generally; <15 tonnes (t) per net, except for 20072009. CPUE; increased significantly during the autumn-winter (April to; August), then gradually decreased in the spring and early; summer (September to December). Average standardized; CPUE in 20012005 was 23.3 t per net, but decreased to; 19.7 t per net in 20062010. The change in the gravity center; location of CPUE between months was similar during the; primary fishing period (autumn to winter) in 20012006.; After 2006, the pattern began to differ in JulyOctober,; which resulted in fishers spending more time to search for; aggregations. A seasonal change was observed in the range; of SSTs associated with high CPUE. Generally, the optimal; SST range was from 13.015.0°C in autumn, 12.014.0°C in; winter, 1316°C in spring, and 1519°C before 2006. However,; a 12°C decrease in the optimal range in recent years; was associated with a shift in the fishing grounds location to; the southern area. In 2009, the optimal SST range was lower; than in all other years. Taken together, the results suggest; that a more thorough understanding of the seasonal or decadal; relationship between SST and location of the fishing; grounds is critical to improving the efficiency of the fishery; and its management."
1556,1475,Recovery of a rodent community in an agro-ecosystem after flooding,"The Dongting Lake region is one of the areas prone to flood disaster in China. Despite the frequent occurrence of flooding in this area, few studies have analysed its effects on rodent communities, especially their recovery after withdrawal of floodwaters. We carried out a study of rodent recovery after flooding of the Dongting Lake region in 1998. Rodent population monitoring in the flooded countryside of the Dongting Lake region was conducted during 1998-2001. The census was conducted in Anzao polder of Anxian County in Hunan Province, where the dike burst in 1998 and thousands of hectares of farmland were flooded from July to October. The results indicate that flood disaster could provide important changes in rodent community structure. Firstly, species abundance in the post-flood area became less than in the normal area. Striped field mice Apodemus agrarius colonized the flooded area in farmland until March 2000, and Norway rats Rattus norvegicus and house mice Mus musculus occurred in July and December 2000, respectively. The degree of the effect on the rodent community in residential premises is less than that in farmland. However, the rodent community in the flooded area could recover and become similar to the normal community. The recovery of rodent species composition was faster in residential premises than in farmland after flooding. Secondly, there was a similar tendency of the dominant concentration indices between post-flood and normal areas. Thirdly, inundation for a long period could reduce the species diversity of the rodent community in farmland. The significant difference in abundance was continued to 2000 in post-flooded farmland; however, the influence on the rodent community in residential premises was less and their diversity indices did not differ in 1999. Similarity indices indicated that variation between post-flood and normal areas had been gradually becoming low from 1999 to 2001. Finally, the monitoring data showed that rodent populations in the flooded area were less than those in the normal area in the first step after withdrawal of floodwaters. However, the rodent population increased rapidly in the flooded area, and became greater than that in the unflooded area in half a year. The population in the flooded area also increased faster than that in unflooded neighbouring area after the application of rodenticide. Another phenomenon was that the population density of rodents could reach levels greater than the normal area, and may continue for more than 2 years. Flood disasters could reduce population densities and species abundance, species diversity and evenness, while increasing dominant concentration indices of the rodent community. However, after 3 years, the rodent community structure became similar to that in the non-flooded area, except for high density. The recovery of rodent communities in residential premises was faster than that in farmland for a lesser degree of flooding. "
1557,3207,The changing abundance and distribution of Greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons in the Yangtze River floodplain: impacts of recent hydrological changes,"Count data show that wintering Greater White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons numbers in their Chinese stronghold (the Yangtze River catchment) have fallen from about 140,000 in the late 1980s and early 1990s to c.18,000 now, despite increases in the overall flyway population (mostly wintering in South Korea and Japan). Declines have occurred in Jiangxi, but most markedly in Hunan (predominantly at East Dongting Lake) where the decline has been steady since 2003/2004, with few left from 2008/2009 onwards. Numbers have increased substantially in Anhui (predominantly at Shengjin Lake), which now supports more Greater White-fronted Geese than Jiangxi and Hunan combined. The species appears a habitat specialist in China, confined to grazing short-sward recessional Carex sedge meadows. At East Dongting Lake, reductions in Greater White-fronted Geese numbers correlated with declines in availability of suitable sedge swards, caused by earlier water table recession, which in recent years has meant swards were too tall for geese to utilise from their arrival in autumn. The hydrological changes are most probably due to the commissioning of the Three Gorges Dam in mid-2003. At Shengjin Lake, the increases may be due to recent stable first exposure dates and slow water recession rates which favour short Carex swards attractive to geese; high buffalo grazing density at this lake may also assist in maintaining suitable sward heights. These hypotheses require investigation. "
1558,2675,"Abundance and conservation status of the Yangtze finless porpoise in the Yangtze River, China","The Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) is endemic to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China. It is the only freshwater population of porpoises in the world and is currently listed as Endangered by IUCN. In November and December 2006 we used two boats and line transect methods to survey the entire current range of the population, except for two lakes (Poyang and Dongting). Sighting results were similar for both boats, so we pooled all data and analyzed them using two line transect models and a strip transect model. All models produced similar estimates of abundance (1111, 1225 and 1000). We then added independent estimates of the number of porpoises from the two lakes for a total estimate of approximately 1800 porpoises. Our findings indicate that the population continues to decline and that its distribution is becoming more fragmented. Our current estimate in the main river is slightly less than half the estimate from surveys between 1984 and 1991 (which was probably an underestimate). We also found an apparent gap in the distribution of porpoises between Yueyang and Shishou ([approximately]150 km), where sightings had previously been common. Continued threats to Yangtze finless porpoises include bycatch in unregulated and unselective fishing, habitat degradation through dredging, pollution and noise, vessel strikes and water development. Immediate protective measures are urgently needed to ensure the persistence of finless porpoises in the Yangtze River. The survey design and analytical methods developed in this study might be appropriate for surveys of cetaceans in other river systems. "
1559,2104,Population dynamics and stock assessment of Wanshan Spring Decapterus maruadsi (T. & S.) in South China Sea,"The general production model of Deriso-Schnute is modified to assess the stock of Wanshan Spring Decapterus maruadsi (T. & S.) in the South China Sea, using catch/effort data from 1960 to 1984. Limited data on age composition and growth were available and these were used to estimate growth parameters, the natural survival rate and proportions of fish recruiting at early ages. Stock-recruitment and catchability parameters were estimated by fitting the catch/effort data to the Deriso-Schnute model, using nonlinear parameter estimation. Equilibrium analysis for the fitted model suggests that the virginal stock was .apprx. 63 600 tons, of which the maximum average yield is close to 17 900 tons and would be associated with an average biomass of .apprx. 30 000 tons. To take this maximum would require approximately the present annual fishing capacity of 250 fishing boats, producing a 0.60 annual harvest rate. The present stock is at the lowest level on record; different recovery and management strategies were evaluated by computer simulations. Only .apprx. 3 years would be needed for the stock to recover to optimum equilibrium biomass with no fishing, but it is suggested that a longer recovery period, under reduced fishing effort, would be preferable."
1560,1586,Factorial analysis of population dynamics in rodents,"During the breeding season demographic processes in the vole populations basically depend on intrinsic factors. The latter, however, are influenced by circumstances related to the location of the population within the species geographical range, as well as to the habitat quality. Extrinsic factors, like weather and food conditions, are the most effective in autumn-winter and winter-spring. Analysis of multiannual population dynamics of two sympatric vole species shows that reproduction is influenced by the abundance and population structure of both of them. -from Author"
1561,4215,New evidence may support the persistence and adaptability of the near-extinct Chinese sturgeon,"Damming the Yangtze River has resulted in a shortened spawning migration distance and time period, created altered and fewer spawning locations, reduced spawning population size, and narrowed the spawning temperature range for the Chinese sturgeon, Acipenser sinensis. No sign of spawning activity was detected in 2013 and 2014, raising concern about the possible extinction of the species. However, the recent discovery of four wild juvenile Chinese sturgeon in the Yangtze Estuary in 2015 suggests that following a short time period when spawning was suspended, a few Chinese sturgeon have resumed spawning at an unknown location in the Yangtze River. This demonstrates that Chinese sturgeon have an extraordinary ability to adapt to environmental changes. However, they appear to have reached their limit in adapting to the drastically changed riverine environment. Innovative conservation efforts are needed to improve the chances for survival of this critically endangered species."
1562,2566,The role of forest reserves in the protection of the Black Stork Ciconia nigra in central Poland,"The black stork Ciconia nigra in central Poland (Lódź voivodship) increased from about 3 breeding pairs in the 1940s to 59 pairs in 2003. The density of the BS was 0.3 pairs per 100 km2 of the total study area in 2003,1.6 pairs per 100 km^ of forested area and 3.3 pairs per 100 km^ of forests older than 60 years. Eleven pairs of black storks built their nests within the boundaries of the forest reserves, 34 pairs had nests outside the forest reserves, and six pairs had one nest inside and one nest outside the reserves.Thus, the black stork shows a strong tendency to build nests in the forest reserves. The greatest increase in the number of breeding pairs in central Poland was recorded in the 1970s. At that time, most of the forest reserves were already established, making growth in the number of pairs possible. Forest reserves protect old-growth stands, which provide breeding trees for the storks. In addition, forest reserves serve as refuges from human encroachment and are thus of crucial importance for long-term protection of the breeding sites of the black stork."
1563,3086,Rapid and continued population decline in the Spoon-billed Sandpiper Eurynorhynchus pygmeus indicates imminent extinction unless conservation action is taken,"The Spoon-billed Sandpiper Eurynorhynchus pygmeus (IUCN Category: Critically Endangered) is in rapid decline. Data from across the entire breeding range (Chukotka and Koryakya in the Russian far north-east) and especially from the well-studied southern core breeding area at Meinypilgyno, confirm the continuing strong decline. At four breeding sites, where more than two counts were available for analysis, the decline was estimated at 26% per annum between 2002 and 2009, or an 88% decline over this period. Allowing for unsurveyed areas, this equates to a decline from a total population of approximately 1,000 breeding pairs in 2000 to 120-220 in 2009. Breeding studies at Meinypilgyno in 2003-2007 (not 2006) showed that the proportion of nests hatching at least one chick was 0.65 and once chicks left the nest, the mean brood size of chicks up to one week old was 1.99. Where it was possible to follow broods, 0.61 chicks fledged per nesting attempt. Survival and recruitment analysis of birds ringed at Meinypilgyno indicated that annual adult survival did not significantly differ over the 2003-2009 study but that recruitment in to the adult breeding population was effectively zero in all but one year of the study (2005). Resighting data for the last two years of the study were sparse due to very low numbers of marked adults being recorded and survival rates over the last 2-3 years of the study must therefore be treated with caution. The analysis therefore indicated that after fledging, survival during immaturity must be very low, leading to a low (or no) recruitment into an ageing population. Recent observations collated from the non-breeding areas confirm the declining trend observed in the breeding areas and imply that the main threats to the population lie along the migration route or in the wintering areas. These are poorly known although hunting in the wintering areas has been identified as a major mortality factor. Other threats include major loss of their intertidal habitats, and collection of birds on the breeding areas by specimen collectors. Improved monitoring in both the breeding and non-breeding areas as well as research on juvenile survival is recommended. Concerted international conservation action is essential if this species is to avoid extinction. This requires (i) improved understanding of the main wintering and staging areas and associated threats; (ii) addressing those threats that can be tackled with immediate effect, such as hunting; (iii) continued long-term monitoring on the breeding areas; (iv) an exploration of other potential breeding areas; (v) conservation action at all important stop-over and wintering sites along the entire flyway and (vi) consideration of a captive-breeding programme to ensure the survival of this species.

1564,4114,Population status and  natural history notes on the critically endangered stream-dwelling frog Craugastor ranoides in a Costa Rican Tropical Dry Forest,"The Craugastor rugulosus species series has been one of the most affected clades by the decline of amphibian populations in Mesoamerica. These stream-dwelling frogs are threatened at all altitudinal ranges throughout their distribution. Craugastor ranoides is categorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to the disappearance of populations in the highlands and lowlands of Costa Rica. Currently the species is only found on the Santa Elena Peninsula. Additional ecological and natural history studies are necessary to formulate conservation plans for this species, which should include captive breeding programs and continuous monitoring of wild populations. We conducted a study of density, habitat use, and morphometrics of C. ranoides in three streams on the Santa Elena Peninsula Guanacaste, Costa Rica, during two consecutive dry seasons. The density of adult frogs and the probabilities of detection were similar during both dry seasons but we found differences in both parameters between streams. Counts of juveniles and subadults differed between seasons and between streams. Stream sector (50-m length) occupancy was approximately 80% during both dry seasons. We found most frogs motionless on boulders, but juveniles also frequented leaf litter. Sexual dimorphism was found in snout-vent length, mass, and tympanum diameter in subadults and adults. This study establishes a baseline for further monitoring of wild populations. Additional research and monitoring are necessary to detect possible changes in abundance and potential decline of these populations, which might be the only ones remaining in Costa Rica. "
1565,2572,Habitat fragmentation and population size of the black and gold howler monkey (Alouatta caraya) in a semideciduous forest in northern Argentina,"A population of black and gold howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) living near the southern limit of its distribution in a semideciduous forest located in northern Argentina was studied in 2003 to evaluate the possible effects of habitat fragmentation - owing to logging - on its density and social organization within it. Aerial photographs taken in 1982, 1992, and 2001 were used to compare maps of vegetation. These maps were used to evaluate changes in the area covered by forest fragments. From March to June 2003, 10-day monthly surveys of howlers were made in each fragment. A total of 232 individual howlers were counted, belonging to 34 groups plus a solitary adult female. Groups ranged from 2 to 19 individuals (mean = 6.82, SD = 4.23), and 21% of the groups contained more than one adult male. Adults accounted for 55% of the individuals, immatures for 45%, and infants represented 13% of the total. Data obtained were compared with information available for the same population for 1982 and 1995. Results revealed no significant changes in the area of fragments, the crude and ecological density of howlers, and group composition. Group sizes and group composition of howlers suggest that the population remained stable over the past 22 years. The density, number of groups, and individuals appears not to be affected by fragmentation and logging, but crude density was low compared with other less-disturbed habitats. The status of the population remains uncertain owing to isolation, and because there are no protected areas to ensure its stability for the future."
1566,4192,Simultaneous population fluctuations of rodents in montane forests and alpine meadows suggest indirect effects of tree masting,"Resource pulses can generate cross-habitat dispersal of consumers, and therefore affect organisms even in areas where the resource pulses do not occur. We investigated this phenomenon at the elevational treeline in the Carpathian Mountains, where beech (Fagus sylvatica) masting caused an increase in abundance of forest rodents and intensified their use of alpine meadows. We tested 3 hypotheses concerning the impact of forest rodent spillover on the abundance of meadow-dwelling pine voles (Microtus subterraneus): 1) the competition hypothesis: if the spillover affects pine voles mostly through intensified competitive interactions, then pine voles should decline when forest rodents reach their peak abundance, i.e., 1 year after masting; 2) the apparent competition hypothesis: if predators switch to alternative prey when populations of forest rodents collapse, then pine voles should decline 2 years after masting; and 3) the apparent mutualism hypothesis: if the increase of forest rodents temporarily releases pine voles from predatory pressure, pine voles should increase in synchrony with forest rodents-1 year after masting. Our results, while correlative in nature, supported the apparent mutualism hypothesis: 1 year after masting, both forest rodents and pine voles strongly increased their abundance. Two years after masting, when populations of forest rodents crashed, abundance of pine voles returned to pre-masting levels rather than collapse. These findings suggest that pulsed spillover, known mostly from negative effects on organisms in recipient habitats, can also create indirect positive interactions. Furthermore, they illustrate how density-dependent spillover of animals might increase the spatial scale of masting effects beyond the habitats where seeds are released."

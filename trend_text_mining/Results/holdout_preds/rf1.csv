2987,Density-Dependent Spillover from a Marine Reserve: Long-Term Evidence,"Spillover, the net export of adult fish, is one mechanism by which no-take marine reserves may eventually have a positive influence on adjacent fisheries. Although evidence for spillover has increased recently, mechanisms inducing movement of adult fish from reserve to fished areas are poorly understood. While density-dependent export is a reasonable expectation, given that density of fish targeted by fisheries should increase over time inside well-protected no-take reserves, no study to date has demonstrated development of the process. This study provides evidence consistent with density-dependent export of a planktivorous reef fish, Naso vlamingii, from a small no-take reserve (protected for 20 years) at Apo Island, Philippines. Mean density of N. vlamingii increased threefold inside the reserve between 1983 and 2003. Density approached an asymptote inside the reserve after 15-20 years of protection. Modal size in the reserve increased from 35 to 45 cm total length (TL) over 20 years of protection. In addition, both density and modal size increased outside the reserve close to (200-300 m), but not farther from (300-500 m), the reserve boundary over the 20 years of reserve protection. Movement of adult N. vlamingii across the boundaries of the reserve was rare. Aggressive interactions among adult N. vlamingii were significantly higher (by 3.7 times) inside than outside the reserve. This suggests that density-dependent interactions were more intense inside the reserve. When interacting adults differed in size, the larger individual usually chased away the smaller one. Furthermore, the mean size of adult fish captured by experimental fishing decreased from 35-cm TL 50-100 m outside the boundary, to 32-cm TL 250-300 m outside the boundary. This represents some of the best evidence available for density-dependent home-range relocation of fish from a no-take reserve.

1742,"Population status of North American green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris","North American green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris, was petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The two questions that need to be answered when considering an ESA listing are; (1) Is the entity a species under the ESA and if so (2) is the ""species"" in danger of extinction or likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range? Green sturgeon genetic analyses showed strong differentiation between northern and southern populations, and therefore, the species was divided into Northern and Southern Distinct Population Segments (DPSs). The Northern DPS includes populations in the Rogue, Klamath-Trinity, and Eel rivers, while the Southern DPS only includes a single population in the Sacramento River. The principal risk factors for green sturgeon include loss of spawning habitat, harvest, and entrainment. The Northern DPS is not considered to be in danger of extinction or likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future. The loss of spawning habitat is not large enough to threaten this DPS, although the Eel River has been severely impacted by sedimentation due to poor land use practices and floods. The two main spawning populations in the Rogue and Klamath-Trinity rivers occupy separate basins reducing the potential for loss of the DPS through catastrophic events. Harvest has been substantially reduced and green sturgeon in this DPS do not face substantial entrainment loss. However there are significant concerns due to lack of information, flow and temperature issues, and habitat degradation. The Southern DPS is considered likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future. Green sturgeon in this DPS are concentrated into one spawning area outside of their natural habitat in the Sacramento River, making them vulnerable to catastrophic extinction. Green sturgeon spawning areas have been lost from the area above Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River and Oroville Dam on the Feather River.

4028,Monitoring the status and trends of tropical forest terrestrial vertebrate communities from camera trap data: a tool for conservation,"Reducing the loss of biodiversity is key to ensure the future well being of the planet. Indicators to measure the state of biodiversity should come from primary data that are collected using consistent field methods across several sites, longitudinal, and derived using sound statistical methods that correct for observation/detection bias. In this paper we analyze camera trap data collected between 2008 and 2012 at a site in Costa Rica (Volcan Barva transect) as part of an ongoing tropical forest global monitoring network (Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring Network). We estimated occupancy dynamics for 13 species of mammals, using a hierarchical modeling approach. We calculated detection-corrected species richness and the Wildlife Picture Index, a promising new indicator derived from camera trap data that measures changes in biodiversity from the occupancy estimates of individual species. Our results show that 3 out of 13 species showed significant declines in occupancy over 5 years (lowland paca, Central American agouti, nine-banded armadillo). We hypothesize that hunting, competition and/or increased predation for paca and agouti might explain these patterns. Species richness and the Wildlife Picture Index are relatively stable at the site, but small herbivores that are hunted showed a decline in diversity of about 25%.

3615,Hydrological attributes and rheophilic freshwater fish: stock assessment,"The mathematical and statistical advances in fitting stock assessment models enabled the emergence of the paradigm of ""integrated analysis"", which fits all available data to a single model of population dynamics that traditionally has total catch as the only forcing function of the system. This approach, however, allowed us to include, in a flexible way, the effect of hydrological regime as an additional forcing function. We tried to achieve this flexibility by making the annual recruitment rates and spawning biomass adjustable to the attributes of the hydrological cycle data. Our models showed that these attributes are influential in the population dynamics of Brycon hilarii of the Northern Pantanal, and their inclusion in the models allowed best partial fits (which considered fits only to the data components length- and age-compositions, CPUE of juveniles and adults) than the Base-case (without hydrological attributes). The best partial fits where obtained when the attributes ""delay of floods"" and ""intensity of floods"" were forcing the spawning biomass and the annual recruitment respectively, indicating that these characteristics of the population may be influenced by specific attributes of the water level.

Only Micronesian Starlings (Aplonis opaca) increased in abundance. Declines occurred in species abundant in both forested and open habitats, suggesting that the declines were unlikely to be simply the result of deforestation. While the introduction of the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) on Guam caused the collapse of that island's avifauna, we do not believe that Rota's declines are due to the establishment of a snake population.

2622,Density-dependent population growth in a reintroduced population of North Island saddlebacks,"1. Reintroductions provide a good opportunity to study density-dependent population growth, as populations can be studied at a range of densities and the change in density is not confounded with environmental conditions. An understanding of density dependence is also necessary to predict dynamics of reintroduced populations under different management regimens, and assess the extent to which they can be harvested for further reintroductions. 2. We monitored a North Island saddleback (Philesturnus rufusater) population for 6 years after reintroduction to Mokoia, a 135 ha island in New Zealand that was made suitable for saddlebacks by eradicating introduced Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). We modelled adult and juvenile survival using Program MARK, and modelled numbers of young fledged per pair using Proc Mixed in SAS with individual female as a random factor. 3. Juvenile survival clearly declined as the population increased, and the decline was closely correlated with the number of breeding pairs. Reproduction also showed a clear decline that was explained by two factors: a difference in quality between territories occupied immediately after reintroduction and those occupied later, and an overall decline as the number of pairs increased. Reproduction was also strongly affected by age, and this needed to be accounted for when modelling density dependence. 4. A stochastic simulation model incorporating these dynamics closely predicted the observed population growth. The equilibrium population size was insensitive to density dependence in reproduction, but highly sensitive to density dependence in juvenile survival. 5.

1357,Dynamics and Viability of a New Zealand Robin Population Reintroduced to Regenerating Fragmented Habitat,"New Zealand Robins (Petroica australis) were reintroduced to Tiritiri Matangi, a highly modified island undergoing an extensive revegetation program. The island had only 13 ba of fragmented forest likely to be suitable for robins. We wished to determine whether the population was likely to persist until additional habitat became available through maturation of the revegetation and, therefore, whether it was sensible to reintroduce this species early in the restoration program. We used an information-theoretic approach to model survival, fecundity, sex ratio, and juvenile dispersal for this population, based on data collected in the first 6years after reintroduction. This involved nominating a limited set of plausible models for each process and then selecting the models that best explained the data based on Akaike's information criterion. We used mark-recapture analysis on survey data to model survival and general linear modeling on fecundity data. The best models were as follows: (1) juvenile survival declined as population size increased, whereas adult survival was constant among years; (2) fecundity was substantially lower for females in their first year after translocation and varied among forest patches, but did not vary among age classes or years; (3) the expected sex ratio of recruits was 50:50; (4) the distribution of recruits depended on the number of existing residents in patches and patch sizes, but not on patch isolation. We used VORTEX to simulate the dynamics of the population based on these models and associated parameter estimates. The population was predicted to have negligible chance of extinction over several decades under current conditions, and this prediction was not sensitive to uncertainty in parameter estimates or model structure. Maturation of the planted matrix should allow the population to expand to several hundred birds over the next few decades, preventing extreme loss of genetic variation. We therefore conclude that the early reintroduction of this species was reasonable, despite the limited habitat available at the time. Our results show that it is critical to obtain data for the first few years after reintroduction if habitat is likely to be limited, because it is otherwise impossible to detect density-dependent processes critical to population viability.

Both species were abundant in the estuary but exhibited differential use of habitats along both gradients. Smooth flounder were most abundant at the mesohaline, riverine habitat, whereas winter flounder were most abundant at the polyhaline, open-bay habitat. Both species exhibited a generalized up-river movement as salinity increased with the seasons. Smooth flounder showed ontogenetic changes in distribution along the depth gradient, with smallest individuals occupying shallowest depths. Intertidal mudflats were an important nursery area for young-of-the-year smooth flounder.

4330,Drastic population size change in two populations of the Golden-striped salamander over a forty-year period—Are eucalypt plantations to blame?,"Over the last half century the Iberian peninsula has seen the large scale planting of exotic gum trees (Eucalyptus sp.) therewith reducing space for native wildlife. An additional effect of the gum tree plantations may be the lowering of the water table in adjacent streams, to which amphibian species with a larval niche in the running sections of small streams would be especially susceptible. In northwestern Iberia that niche is occupied by the Golden-striped salamander, Chioglossa lusitanica. I here report on the demographic trends of two C. lusitanica populations over a forty-year period, in two areas of one mountain range near Porto in northwestern Portugal. In both areas advantage was taken of the migration pattern of C. lusitanica to sites for aestivation and breeding in summer and fall. The area of the Silveirinhos brook was transformed in a plantation of gum trees shortly after the research started, while the area of Poço do Inferno remained virtually unaffected. At Silveirinhos the adult C. lusitanica population declined by one or two orders of magnitude, from ca. 1500 individuals to less than 50 at present. Demographic models that operate under a uniform larval mortality yielded population sizes that are compatible with field observations, including the late onset of the decline at 14 or more years after the planting of the gum trees and the near-extinction at year 32. An alternative reason for the relatively recent population collapse of C. lusitanica may have been disease, but no sick individuals or corpses have become available for clinical investigation. Conversely, the control population at Poço do Inferno increased in size by a factor of five or more. These data support the hypothesis that gum tree plantations have a strong negative effect on C. lusitanica. The population size increase at Poço do Inferno is probably attributable to the installation of wastewater treatment in the adjacent town of Valongo, with a discharge in the Simão river and closely connected to Poço do Inferno. This result suggests that the Simão river contributes to the Poço do Inferno population and that medium-large streams may constitute prime C. lusitanica habitat. Larval mortalities estimated for stable and declining populations are remarkable close (0.69 and 0.73, respectively), but dissimilar to the larval mortality at ca. 0.51 of an increasing population such as at Poço do Inferno.

4243,"Abiotic triggers for sea and river lamprey spawning migration and juvenile outmigration in the River Rhine, Germany"," The activity patterns of migrating lampreys (sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus and river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis) are poorly understood. This study uses extensive screening data from the cooling water intake of a nuclear power plant on the River Rhine, Germany, gathered on 1308 days over 46 consecutive months between 2011 and 2014. More than 34,000 lampreys were retrieved, of which the great majority (99.9%) were outmigrating nonfeeding postmetamorphic individuals. The main factors controlling outmigration were season, water temperature and river discharge. The bulk of downstream migration was observed each year in spring at water temperatures between 9 and 12°C, with earlier migrations during significant discharge peaks between December and February. The migration activity of postmetamorphic individuals declined during summer and autumn, regardless of discharge. Turbidity increased the occurrence of postmetamorphic lampreys and supported diurnal migration, which accounted for nearly 20% of all lamprey records. In winter, outmigrating individuals of both species exhibited significantly longer body lengths than those detected during other seasons. Haematophagus postmetamorphic sea lampreys were also retrieved (n = 28) and represent the most upstream records of parasitically feeding sea lamprey detected thus far. Adult lampreys migrating upstream were found mainly in spring, but in very low numbers, indicating high prespawning mortalities.

This survey covered the largest number of anatum populations to date and resulted in a larger number of occupied anatum territories and territorial anatum pairs than found in any of the previous surveys. The largest increases took place in Ontario and in central and southern Alberta, where mass reintroductions of captive-raised young had occurred yearly since 1992.

3785,Recent status and population decline of the Great Bustard Otis tarda in Iran,"The current distribution and recent population trends of the Great Bustard ( Otis tarda ) in Iran were investigated based on a literature review and unpublished data (19952008) followed by three years of census (20092011) in areas where the species is still breeding. Results suggest that Great Bustards have disappeared from a large part of their former distribution in the country, including East Azarbayjan, Hamedan and Kurdistan provinces. The surviving groups are concentrated in West Azarbayjan where numbers are rapidly declining.

2499,Population dynamics of the White Stork Ciconia ciconia in western France,"Population dynamics of the White Stork Ciconia ciconia were studied in Charente-Maritime, France from 1978 to 1996, during which time the number of breeding pairs increased from one to 44. Modal age at first return and first breeding were 2.4 and 3.4 years, respectively. White Storks produced an average of 3.2 fledglings per nest. The average number of fledglings per nest decreased with increasing nest density, probably because of an increase in the number of interactions between breeding birds. Nests surrounded by marshes had slightly greater productivity than nests on peripheral sites. Individual White Storks followed an annual breeding cycle and attempted to breed in 97% of seasons once mature. Nest-site and mate fidelity were high (88 and 83%, respectively). Immigration rate was nearly twice that of emigration during the last few years of the study and recruitment was close to 30%, although underestimated. We modelled survival and recapture probabilities using capture-mark-recapture methods. Adult survival was found to be dependent on age, but not sex. Survival of younger birds varied greatly over the years, whereas survival of older birds was relatively constant and averaged 78%. Survival rates of young birds wintering in the Sahel zone were positively linked to the amount of rainfall in their wintering area. The proximate reason for the population increase was probably immigration of birds from other European countries, probably encouraged by a high adult survival rate. Ringing recoveries indicate that some birds winter in Spain and the high adult survival rate may reflect a change in migratory pattern in recent years.

2650,Temporal variation in tiger (Panthera tigris) populations and its implications for monitoring,"Tigers (Panthera tigris) are endangered wild felids whose elusive nature and naturally low densities make them notoriously difficult to count. We present 7 years of camera trapping, tracking, and observational data on a local tiger population in Chitwan National Park, Nepal, to quantify changes in abundance of demographic groups and to identify underlying causes. Mean abundance in the 100-km2 study area was 18 tigers, but there was high variance among years. Transients were generally recorded at low levels, but there were large oscillations in numbers of tiger offspring, driven by infanticide perpetrated by male tigers taking over territories. The number of breeding animals in the study area remained relatively stable, with about 6 breeding females and 1 or 2 breeding males. The high density of breeding adults in Chitwan National Park highlights the region as a potential stronghold for tigers.

4564,"Roles of discharge and temperature in recruitment of a cold-water fish, the European grayling Thymallus thymallus, near its southern range limit"," Recruitment of salmonids is a result of density-dependent factors, specifically egg production in the previous year, and density-independent environmental processes driven by discharge and temperature. With the plethora of knowledge on major drivers of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta recruitment, there is a requirement to explore less known species, such as European grayling Thymallus thymallus, whose postemergence time coincides with period of increasing temperature and low discharge. This study assessed drivers of grayling recruitment in a southern English chalk stream, a system vulnerable to discharge and temperature alterations under future climate change predictions. The analyses explored age 0+ grayling survival in relation to conspecific and heterospecific densities and discharge- and temperature-derived factors. The final mixed-effects model revealed a positive relationship between age 0+ grayling survival and incubation temperature anomaly and age 0+ trout abundance. Similarly, postincubation temperature anomaly had a positive effect on 0+ grayling survival, but only up to a threshold temperature of 13.5°C, beyond which it had a negative effect. In contrast, increasing number of days with low discharge postincubation negatively influenced age 0+ grayling survival, with no evidence of an effect of elevated discharges following spawning. Our results emphasise the importance of maintaining natural discharge regimes in salmonid rivers by tackling multiple stressors operating at the catchment scale, including land and water use to mitigate for predicted climate driven changes.

1954,Population density estimates and growth rates of Eleutherodactylus coqui in Hawaii,"The Puerto Rican terrestrial frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) has received considerable attention in Hawaii because of its rapid spread, loud mating calls, and its potential threat to native species. Thus far, its invasion potential on the Island of Hawaii remains poorly understood. Critical components for determining this potential are robust estimates of abundance and vital rates across habitat types. To address this lack of information, we used mark-recapture methods to estimate E. coqui survival and abundance, determine growth rates of adult male and female frogs, and relate densities to elevation, snout-vent length (SVL), habitat structure, and invertebrate abundance. Mean adult E. coqui density across eight sites was 62 [plus or minus] 12 adults/100 m2 and ranged from 6-138 adults/100 m2. Our three-year mean adult density estimates were three times greater at three of our study sites (100 adults/100 m2) than the highest long-term estimates from Puerto Rico (33 adults/100 m2). Mean individual growth rates were 0.0078 mm/day ([plus or minus] 0.007 SD, N = 87) for males and 0.0097 mm/day ([plus or minus] 0.009 SD, N = 11) for females. Frogs of similar size were found to be growing slower in Hawaii than Puerto Rico. We found no relationship between elevation and E. coqui density or elevation and SVL or between invertebrate abundance and E. coqui density. However, there was a positive relationship between understory structure and E. coqui density.

While 150 animals were present in the study area (1050 km2) in 1996, only 15 were observed in 2007. A 12 mo assessment of fishing effort and catch, together with circumstantial evidence, suggests that the decline was caused largely by prey depletion resulting from overfishing. We analyzed the impacts of various fishing gear and estimated the degree of resource overlap between common dolphins and local fisheries. The total biomass removed annually by 308 fishing boats in the study area averaged 3571 t, while that consumed by common dolphins was 17 t. Resource overlap between common dolphins and fisheries - expressed as an average Pianka index of 0.5 - differed according to fishing gear, being higher for purse seiners (0.7) and beach seiners (0.4) and lower for bottom trawlers (0.1), trammel boats (0.2) and longliners (0.0). Only about 10 active purse seiners (4 % of the total active fishing fleet) were responsible for 33 % of the biomass removal, and likely had the greatest impact on prey of common dolphins.

4311,Dramatic decline of the bearded reedling Panurus biarmicus in Spanish Mediterranean wetlands,"The apparent stability of the bearded reedling in Spanish inland wetlands contrasts with its threatened status in Spanish coastal wetlands. The species has already disappeared from some coastal areas in Catalonia and its situation is critical in the region of Valencia. In 2013 we studied the breeding populations in three wetlands in Valencia using two methods: census by exhaustive search of individuals (territory mapping) and distance sampling using line transects. We estimated the trend of these populations from data obtained in previous censuses (2005 and 2006), and assessed their viability in the medium and short term using count-based population viability analysis (PVA). Results were alarming in the three studied wetlands, especially in the Albufera de Valencia, where only one breeding pair was found. The percentage of decrease of estimated pairs was similar in all wetlands: ca. 90% between 2005 and 2013. Results from the PVAs predicted a 90% probability of reaching the quasi-extinction threshold before 2024 or 2028 for the largest population of bearded reedling in the Valencia region, El Hondo, while for the Santa Pola population this threshold would be reached before 2016 or 2017. The parallel trend and generalized decline in the Spanish coastal wetlands suggests that these Mediterranean wetlands probably share some specific factors that have adversely affected its populations. Given that all these natural spaces are surrounded by intensively irrigated crops that are subjected to the intense use of pesticides, we hypothesize that these products could have had a detrimental effect on the bearded reedling. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the healthiest populations are situated in Iberian inland wetlands that are surrounded by dry crops, where the use of pesticides is less intense.

We accumulated 1,961 independent records of 31 mammal species and 427 images of 17 bird species during 5,547 trap-days. Number of mammal species ranged from 15 to 25 per year (107 to 466 images), whereas birds ranged from 3 to 11 species per year (10 to 122 images). Capture rates varied both among species and among years but showed no evidence of declines; populations of several species appeared to increase (Priodontes maximus, Dasypus novemcinctus, Pecari tajacu, and Dasyprocta fuliginosa). Similarly, occupancy rates provided no indication of consistent declines; occupancy rates increased significantly for D. fuliginosa, D. novemcinctus, and P. maximus. There was no indication that variation in either capture rates or occupancy was related to variation in large-scale climate trends as represented by the Southern Oscillation Index.

1349,Density dependence in the camelid Vicugna vicugna: the recovery of a protected population in Chile,"The vicuña Vicugna vicugna is a wild South American camelid. Following over-exploitation, which brought the species to the brink of extinction in Chile in the 1960s, the population was protected. Since 1975 the population has been censused annually, generating one of the most extensive long-term census databases for any South American mammal. In this paper we use these data, and measures of environmental parameters, to describe the population growth trend of the species and to estimate carrying capacity. Our results indicate that the vicuña has been protected successfully in northern Chile. The census data reveal that, following protection, the population displayed logistic growth between 1975 and 1992. Population growth rate declined linearly with population size, which indicates a degree of density dependence. Density independent factors, such as rainfall, may also have been important. The principal density dependent effect observed was that birth rate declined in those family groups with the most breeding females. The carrying capacity of the study area was estimated from the census data and from models based on precipitation and local primary productivity. Using the census data, an estimation of carrying capacity as the asymptote of the fitted logistic curve suggested that the vicuña population should reach approximately 26,000 vicuñas, whereas estimation when the population growth rate was equated to zero gave a carrying capacity of c. 22,000. Coe's method based on local precipitation predicted 31,000 vicuña, whereas Lavenroth's method based on local primary productivity predicted 26,000 vicuña. In reality, the census data showed that the population peaked at 22,463 vicuñas in 1990. The results are discussed in relation to the need for better census techniques and the implications of density dependent effects for the management of the vicuña in Chile.

852,Population cycles in small mammals: the problem of explaining the low phase,"Cycles characterize the demography of many populations of microtine rodents and snowshoe hares. A phase of low numbers often follows the decline and introduces a lag that lengthens the cycle. This low can last 1-3 yr in microtines and 2-4 yr in hares. Understanding the low phase is critical in explaining population cycles. Two major classes of hypotheses try to account for the low phase. The first proposes that something may be 'wrong' with the extrinsic environment. The most promising of these extrinsic explanations is that predation, acting either directly or indirectly, has delayed density-dependent effects on prey populations during the low phase. The second class of hypotheses proposes that something may be 'wrong' with the animals themselves. The most likely intrinsic factors are maternal effects or age effects on fitness during the low phase.

2095,Population abundance and growth rate of western gray whales Eschrichtius robustus,"The western population of gray whales Eschrichtius robustus is one of the most endangered whale populations in the world. Recent studies of this population off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia, have produced a photographic dataset that was utilized for the first markrecapture assessment of western gray whale abundance. Given encounter histories of 129 individually identified whales spanning 25 monthly capture occasions from 1997 to 2003, a closed capture estimator was employed to estimate the number of individuals using the study area in each year. Temporary emigration probabilities were then applied to the closed capture estimates to enumerate the total population size of whales off northeastern Sakhalin Island. Total abundances from 1997 to 2003 were estimated as 64 [plus or minus] 5.1 (SE), 55 to 75 (95% CI); 75 [plus or minus] 4.9, 66 to 85; 86 [plus or minus] 3.1, 80 to 93; 77 [plus or minus] 4.7, 68 to 87; 91 [plus or minus] 3.4, 84 to 98; 98 [plus or minus] 4.1, 90 to 106; and 99 [plus or minus] 4.9, 90 to 109, respectively. These abundance estimates, particularly the last values in the series, most likely approximate the size of the entire western gray whale population. For comparison to the trend in the abundance estimates, life history data were used to estimate the growth rate of the population.

3266,Responses of autumn staging waterbirds to wetland restoration and water levels in a Danish river delta,"A 2,200 ha wetland in the Danish Skjern River valley was restored between 1999-2002, partly to re-establish a rich community of migratory waterbirds, in a project which aimed to restore the nutrient retention capacity of the area and to improve its overall value for wildlife and humans. Numbers, distribution and foraging activity of waterbirds were monitored over the first four years after restoration, between late August and late November in 2002-2005. The restoration turned the western part of the project area into important feeding and roosting habitat especially for dabbling ducks, but also for herons, swans, coots and waders during their autumn migration.

89,The Abundance and Conservation Status of Redshank Tringa totanus nesting on saltmarshes in Great Britain.,"We report the results of two surveys of the same sample of 77 saltmarsh sites around the coast of Great Britain, conducted in 1985 and 1996 to estimate breeding abundance and the conservation status (i.e. stable, increasing or declining) of redshank Tringa totanus nesting on saltmarshes. The 1985 estimate was 21 022 pairs (confidence limits: 14 941-26 818 pairs) and the 1996 estimate was 16433 pairs (confidence limits: 11 291-21 943 pairs). Saltmarshes, therefore, support c. 45% of the population of redshank breeding in Great Britain. We present evidence to show that these abundance estimates are unlikely to be biased as a result of poor regional or habitat coverage by the sample of sites surveyed. Comparison of breeding density changes within survey sites between 1985 and 1996 showed a significant mean decline of 10.98 pairs km-2 (confidence limits: 4.68-16.83 pairs km-2). This represented a loss of 4807 breeding pairs, i.e. a 22.9% decline in abundance. We suggest that conservation measures are needed, including the use of habitat creation for breeding redshank.

3654,The ecological impact of invasive cane toads on tropical snakes: Field data do not support laboratory-based predictions,"Predicting which species will be affected by an invasive taxon is critical to developing conservation priorities, but this is a difficult task. A previous study on the impact of invasive cane toads (Bufo marinus) on Australian snakes attempted to predict vulnerability a priori based on the assumptions that any snake species that eats frogs, and is vulnerable to toad toxins, may be at risk from the toad invasion. We used time-series analyses to evaluate the accuracy of that prediction, based on >3600 standardized nocturnal surveys over a 138-month period on 12 species of snakes and lizards on a floodplain in the Australian wet?dry tropics, bracketing the arrival of cane toads at this site. Contrary to prediction, encounter rates with most species were unaffected by toad arrival, and some taxa predicted to be vulnerable to toads increased rather than declined (e.g., death adder Acanthophis praelongus; Children's python Antaresia childreni). Indirect positive effects of toad invasion (perhaps mediated by toad-induced mortality of predatory varanid lizards) and stochastic weather events outweighed effects of toad invasion for most snake species.

4190,"Segregation or aggregation? Sex-specific patterns in the seasonal occurrence of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias at the Neptune Islands, South Australia","The seasonal patterns of occurrence of male and female white sharks Carcharodon carcharias at the Neptune Islands in South Australia were reviewed. Analyses of a 14 year data series indicate that females seasonally aggregate in late autumn and winter coinciding with the maximum in-water availability of lactating female long-nose fur seals and seal pups. During this period, observed male:female sex ratios were similar; whereas during late spring and summer, males continued to visit, but females were rarely recorded. There was no evidence for segregation by sex or size at the Neptunes, but the highly focused seasonal pattern of occurrence of females compared with the year-round records of males suggests that there are likely to be differences between the sexes in overall distribution and movement patterns across southern Australia. It is suggested that foraging strategies and prey selection differ between sexes in C. carcharias across the life-history stages represented and that sex-specific foraging strategies may play an important role in structuring movement patterns and the sex ratios observed at such aggregation sites. Differences between sexes in distribution, movement patterns and foraging strategies are likely to have implications for modelling the consequences of fisheries by-catch between regions or jurisdictions and other spatially or temporally discrete anthropogenic effects on C. carcharias populations. Such differences urge for caution when estimating the size of C. carcharias populations based on observations at pinniped colonies due to the likelihood of sex-specific differences in movements and patterns of residency.

We employed several capture methods, followed their movements with radio telemetry, and studied nesting and nest predation. We captured 173 previously unmarked females, 19 males, 2 juveniles, and 48 hatchlings. We also recaptured 52 females and 5 males. Combining measurements of these terrapins with others previously captured in the same area, mean plastron length for females was 162.2 mm, for males 102.5 mm, and for hatchlings 29.9 mm. Sex ratio was 1.33 males:1 female, and the population of females using the nesting beach is estimated to be 1,350.8. The most successful capture method was hand-capture at the nesting beach; however, we caught only females this way. Modified crab pots allowed capture of both sexes but produced fewer captives and was labor intensive. Cast netting was successful when terrapins were found in groups and were frequently surfacing. We equipped several females from both Deep Creek and the nesting beach with radio transmitters, monitored their activities, and established that the two sites represented separate populations. In at least 1 year, nesting beach terrapins spent the rest of the year in marshes and creeks 35 km upstream in the Nassau River. Deep Creek terrapins were downstream, near the Intracoastal Waterway, in April, May, and June. The rest of the year they were further upstream, and at least 1 wintered in the adjoining Garden Creek. Calculating the 95% isopleth, the mean female home range was 54.33 ha using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, 52.62 ha using the adaptive kernel (AK) method, and 236.92 ha using the fixed kernel (FK) method. For the 50% isopleth the values are 14.91 ha (MCP), 7.69 ha (AK), and 15.02 ha (FK). We used head counts (heads/minute) as a measure of terrapin activity in Deep Creek. No terrapins surfaced from December through February when water temperatures (TW) were 19°C or less. When TW was warmer highest head counts were recorded when salinity was moderate (1525 ppt). More heads were also recorded at higher TW and at lower tides. We recorded nesting from late April through late July. We found most newly deposited nests in May; however, crawl counts indicated that more terrapins visited the beach in June. Most depredated nests were found in June or July, and those from July included both newly deposited and recently hatched nests. Nests preyed upon in August and September were all recently hatched. Most nests were depredated within 24 hours of oviposition. The major nest predator was the raccoon (Procyon lotor), but we also noted crows (Corvus ossifragus and C. branchyrhynchos), boat-tailed grackles (Quiscalus major), an armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata). Hatching and emergence began in early July and continued into October. The mean emergence period for 54 nests was 68.9 days.

No terrapins surfaced from December through February when water temperatures (TW) were 19°C or less. When TW was warmer highest head counts were recorded when salinity was moderate (1525 ppt). More heads were also recorded at higher TW and at lower tides. We recorded nesting from late April through late July. We found most newly deposited nests in May; however, crawl counts indicated that more terrapins visited the beach in June. Most depredated nests were found in June or July, and those from July included both newly deposited and recently hatched nests. Nests preyed upon in August and September were all recently hatched. Most nests were depredated within 24 hours of oviposition. The major nest predator was the raccoon (Procyon lotor), but we also noted crows (Corvus ossifragus and C. branchyrhynchos), boat-tailed grackles (Quiscalus major), an armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata).

2930,Reintroduction of roe deer Capreolus capreolus into a Mediterranean habitat: female mortality and dispersion,"During 1995-1997, 52 male and 52 female roe deer Capreolus capreolus, captured in the Forest of Trois-Fontaines in northeastern France, were introduced into the Petit Luberon state forest in southern France; of these 49 females (21 young that were < 1 year old and 28 adults that were > 1 year old) were monitored by radio-tracking. The overall mortality rate among the females monitored was 47% within one year of release. The first month following the release (February) was critical for the success of the operation as 35% of introduced animals died within this time span. It appears that stress was a major cause of mortality at this time, but traumatic deaths caused by drowning, collision with cars, and falling off cliffs were also frequent. The survival rate increased to 0.9 in spring, summer and early fall and decreased again during late fall and early winter. The high mortality rate occurring during this period may be explained by an increased mobility resulting from disturbance from wild boar Sus scrofa hunting. After the reintroduction, the animals stayed close to the release site (50% within 2.4 km, and 75% within 4 km), though the adults established themselves at longer distances than the young. The dispersion pattern of the females was not uniform throughout the study area: they preferentially settled down northwest of the release site, which may be explained by the topography of our study area and by the absence of human structures (roads, canals) in this area.

Comparison with previous counts indicates a biphasic increase in brown skuas at Signy Island; much faster from 1958/1959 to 1982/1983 (3.3 % per annum), than in subsequent years (0.4 % per annum from 1983/1984 to 2013/2014).

1564,Monitoring Mammal Populations in Costa Rican Protected Areas under Different Hunting Restrictions.,"It is necessary to assess whether the management of protected areas is achieving the objectives set for them. In particular, changes and trends in wildlife populations should be documented. We compared the 1990 abundance of mammals in two Costa Rican protected areas, Corcovado National Park (CNP) and Golfo Dulce Forest Reserve (GDFR), with similar environmental characteristics but different hunting restrictions and levels of protection. We also monitored the abundance of mammals in CNP over a 4-year period. We also devised an inexpensive method of monitoring tropical rainforest mammal populations in a timely and efficient manner. The method is based on the use of mammal track records and arboreal mammal sightings and requires little effort. With this method 20 mammal species were recorded at CNP and 15 at GDFR. Species were consistently less abundant in GDFR than in CNP, principally those species preferred by hunters. Species were grouped according to whether or not they are used as food and whether they are locally or globally threatened or not threatened. The abundance of all these groups of species in GDFR was 6-28% the abundance in CNP. During 1990-1994, overall mammal abundance in CNP remained relatively stable, but there was considerable variability among species. As a group, both species used for food and globally threatened species declined in abundance during that period in CNP. The abundance of all groups of species declined from 1992 to 1994, coinciding with a reduction in hunting vigilance at CNP. Evidence suggests that the main factor differentiating the abundance of mammals in the two protected areas, and at CNP during the study period, was toe level of hunting.

4247,Inter-annual dynamics and persistence of small mammal communities in a selectively logged tropical forest in Borneo,"Understanding temporal change and long-term persistence of species and communities is vital if we are to accurately assess the relative values of human-modified habitats for biodiversity. Despite a large literature and emerging consensus demonstrating a high conservation value of selectively logged tropical rainforests, few studies have taken a long-term perspective. We resampled small mammals (≤ 1 kg) in a heavily logged landscape in Sabah, Borneo between 2011 and 2016 to investigate temporal patterns of species-level changes in population density. We found that small mammal population density in heavily logged forest was highly variable among years, consistent with patterns previously observed in unlogged forest, and uncovered evidence suggesting that one species is potentially declining towards local extinction. Across nine species, population densities varied almost sevenfold during our 6-year study period, highlighting the extremely dynamic nature of small mammal communities in this ecosystem. Strictly terrestrial murid species tended to exhibit strong temporal dynamics, whereas semi-arboreal foraging species such as treeshrews had more stable dynamics. We found no relationships between population density and fruit/seed mass, and therefore no evidence that our patterns represent responses to inter-annual mast fruiting of the dominant canopy dipterocarp trees. This may be due to the removal of most of the canopy during logging, and hence the dipterocarp seed resource, although it possibly also reflects spatiotemporal limitations of our data.

Only one of the reefs experienced an obvious and immediate decline in mean coral cover (from 24 to 8%) due to the cyclone. The abundance and species richness of adult damselfish assemblages on intensive survey sites at this reef were not affected in the short term (6-8 weeks), despite the removal of 48% of living hard coral. Assemblages of adult fishes showed a similar lack of response at three other reefs where no significant habitat changes had occurred. Eleven to twelve months later, the total abundance of damselfishes had decreased substantially at eight of the sampled reefs, while the abundance of larger mobile fishes remained stable. We infer that the effects on coral assemblages reflect the short duration and orientation of the cyclone, the history of exposure to wave energy (influencing life-form structure and therefore degree of fragility), and the degree of consolidation of the reef matrix. The lack of short-term effects of the cyclone on adult fishes shows that these fishes can endure periods of intense underwater turbulence.

4035,Long-term changes in pronghorn abundance index linked to climate and oil development in North Dakota,"The interacting effects of climate change and habitat fragmentation on wildlife are of global conservation concern. Over the past four decades, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) populations in North Dakota have been exposed to severe winter weather, drought, predation, harvest, and rapid oil and gas development. Adult pronghorn counts in North Dakota fluctuated over time with an increasing trend from 1974 to 2007, followed by a rapid decline from2008 to 2012. Our primary objective was to identify key drivers of an index of pronghorn abundance in western North Dakota over this period to inform conservation and management. Despite missing data, Bayesian mixed-effects models allowed us to analyze variation in annual population count data relative to weather conditions, coyote populations, oil and gas development, human harvest, and agricultural practices.We found that lower indices of abundance correspondedwith heavy snowfall and lowwinter temperatures, suggesting that the large observed decline starting in 2008 was primarily due to severe winter weather conditions.We also found that the abundance index was negatively correlated with road and oil/gas well density, of which the; latter increased exponentially during the last decade. In contrast, we found little evidence that coyote populations, drought, and human harvest were major drivers of observed population declines. Based on these findings, we expect that pronghorn populations will be negatively influenced by the anticipated increase in winter storm frequency and continued expansion of oil and gas development.

2846,Source populations in carnivore management: cougar demography and emigration in a lightly hunted population,"Wildlife agencies typically attempt to manage carnivore numbers in localized game management units through hunting, and do not always consider the potential influences of immigration and emigration on the outcome of those hunting practices. However, such a closed population structure may not be an appropriate model for management of carnivore populations where immigration and emigration are important population parameters. The closed population hypothesis predicts that high hunting mortality will reduce numbers and densities of carnivores and that low hunting mortality will increase numbers and densities. By contrast, the open population hypothesis predicts that high hunting mortality may not reduce carnivore densities because of compensatory immigration, and low hunting mortality may not result in more carnivores because of compensatory emigration. Previous research supported the open population hypothesis with high immigration rates in a heavily hunted (hunting mortality rate=0.24) cougar population in northern Washington. We test the open population hypothesis and high emigration rates in a lightly hunted (hunting mortality rate=0.11) cougar population in central Washington by monitoring demography from 2002 to 2007.

Reproductive data (number of nests and number of chicks per nest) and the effect of rainfall on the reproductive success were analyzed. In addition, a number of chicks were colour-ringed each year and the recovery data were also analyzed. The number of nests found in the area steadily increased during the study period and varied greatly from year to year from 2001 onwards (mean 19, range = 4-35, N = 22 years).

1388,Effects of gill-net fishing on marine birds in a biological hotspot in the Northwest Atlantic,"Marine biological hotspots, or areas where high abundances of species overlap in space and time, are ecologically important areas because energy flow through marine food webs, a key ecosystem process, is maximized in these areas. I investigated whether top predators aggregated at persistent spawning sites of a key forage fish species, capelin (Mallotus villosus), on the NE coast of Newfoundland during July and August 2000-2003. By examining the distributional patterns of top predators through ship-based surveys at multiple spatial and temporal scales, I found that the biomasses of birds - dominated by Common Murres (Uria aalge) - and mammals - dominated by whale species - were concentrated along the coast, with a biological hotspot forming near two persistent spawning sites of capelin in all years. The formation of this hotspot was well defined in space and time from middle of July to middle of August, likely coinciding with the spawning chronology of capelin. Within this hotspot, there was a high spatial and temporal overlap of Common Murres and gill nets set to capture Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). This resulted in breeding murres becoming entangled in gill nets while feeding on spawning capelin. Despite an acknowledged uncertainty of bycatch mortality, estimates for the larger regional-scale area (1936-4973 murres/year; 0.2-0.6% of the breeding population) underestimated mortality relative to estimates within the hotspot (3053-14054 murres/year; 0.4-1.7%). Although fishing effort for Atlantic cod has declined substantially since the groundfish moratorium in 1992, chronic, unnatural, and additive mortality through bycatch continues in coastal Newfoundland. Restricted use of gill nets within this and other biological hotspots during the capelin spawning period appears to be a straightforward application of the ""ecological and biologically significant area"" management framework in Canada's Oceans Act. This protection would minimize murre bycatch and maintain ecosystem integrity.

1948,Using counts to simultaneously estimate abundance and detection probabilities in a salamander community,"A critical variable in both ecological and conservation field studies is determining how many individuals of a species are present within a defined sampling area. Labor intensive techniques such as capture-mark-recapture and removal sampling may provide estimates of abundance, but there are many logistical constraints to their widespread application. Many studies on terrestrial and aquatic salamanders use counts as an index of abundance, assuming that detection remains constant while sampling. If this constancy is violated, determination of detection probabilities is critical to the accurate estimation of abundance. Recently, a model was developed that provides a statistical approach that allows abundance and detection to be estimated simultaneously from spatially and temporally replicated counts. We adapted this model to estimate these parameters for salamanders sampled over a six year period in area-constrained plots in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Estimates of salamander abundance varied among years, but annual changes in abundance did not vary uniformly among species. Except for one species, abundance estimates were not correlated with site covariates (elevation, soil and water pH, conductivity, air and water temperature). The uncertainty in the estimates was so large as to make correlations ineffectual in predicting which covariates might influence abundance. Detection probabilities also varied among species and sometimes among years for the six species examined. We found such a high degree of variation in our counts and in estimates of detection among species, sites, and years as to cast doubt upon the appropriateness of using count data to monitor population trends using a small number of area-constrained surrey plots.

For P. microps, the decrease was not so pronounced. No direct effects were attributable to the salinity and temperatures variations (resulting from the drought and high temperatures). Yet, higher predation pressure on P. minutus hypothesis was raised, as the salinity incursion increased the piscivorous marine adventitious species in the downstream areas.

1461,Crab trapping causes population decline and demographic changes in diamondback terrapins over two decades.,"Diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) are thought to be declining throughout their range. Although many factors have been proposed to contribute to terrapin declines, including increased predation of nests and adults, habitat loss and degradation, road mortality, commercial harvest for food, and mortality as bycatch in crab traps, few studies have provided evidence linking these agents to population declines. Because male and small female terrapins are most susceptible to mortality in crab traps, population declines should coincide with shifts in the age and size distributions of the population and a shift to a more female-biased sex ratio. We used twenty-one years of mark-recapture data (>2800 captures of 1399 individuals) from a declining diamondback terrapin population in South Carolina to test the prediction that the decline is the result of mortality in crab traps. Since the 1980s, the modal size of both male and female terrapins has increased substantially and the proportion that are females is higher than in earlier samples. Additionally, the population now contains more old and fewer young individuals than before. The changes in demography and sex ratio we observed suggest that this terrapin population has declined as a result of selective mortality of smaller individuals in crab traps. The use of bycatch-reduction devices on crab traps may help prevent terrapins from entering the traps, but current models are too large to prevent mortality of males and many females in this population.

Because male and small female terrapins are most susceptible to mortality in crab traps, population declines should coincide with shifts in the age and size distributions of the population and a shift to a more female-biased sex ratio. We used twenty-one years of mark-recapture data (>2800 captures of 1399 individuals) from a declining diamondback terrapin population in South Carolina to test the prediction that the decline is the result of mortality in crab traps. Since the 1980s, the modal size of both male and female terrapins has increased substantially and the proportion that are females is higher than in earlier samples. Additionally, the population now contains more old and fewer young individuals than before. The changes in demography and sex ratio we observed suggest that this terrapin population has declined as a result of selective mortality of smaller individuals in crab traps. The use of bycatch-reduction devices on crab traps may help prevent terrapins from entering the traps, but current models are too large to prevent mortality of males and many females in this population.",crab trapping causes population decline demographic changes diamondback terrapins decades factors proposed contribute terrapin declines including increased predation nests adults habitat loss degradation road mortality commercial harvest food mortality bycatch crab traps studies provided evidence linking agents population declines male small female terrapins susceptible mortality crab traps population declines coincide shifts age size distributions population shift female biased sex ratio years mark recapture data captures individuals declining diamondback terrapin population south carolina test prediction decline result mortality crab traps modal size male female terrapins increased substantially proportion females higher earlier samples additionally population contains old fewer young individuals changes demography sex ratio observed suggest terrapin population declined result selective mortality smaller individuals crab traps use bycatch reduction devices crab traps help prevent terrapins entering traps current models large prevent mortality males females population,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline
4359,Effects of anthropogenic food resources on yellow-legged gull colony size on Mediterranean islands,"Yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis populations have been studied on three archipelagos consisting of 20 islands distributed along 80 km of the French Mediterranean coastline. Population changes were analyzed between 1920 and 2006. In the first decades following their settlement on these islands, the yellow-legged gull populations showed a continuous exponential growth in the three archipelagos, in agreement with an annual geometric growth rate λ above 1. The population growth ceased to fit this model during the 1980s for the older colonies (Riou and Hyères Islands archipelagos). Thus, we focused on population changes occurring during the period 1982-2000, a pivotal period for which we have both precise census and anthropogenic food resource data, in order to determine environmental factors influencing these population changes using multiple linear regression models. An average annual growth rate of colony size was 1.02 for the last two decades. The changes in landfill availability, the gull density in 1982, and the nesting area in 1982 explained 84.4% of variation in colony size changes between 1982 and 2000. The yellow-legged gull changes on the islands in the last two decades increased as availability in anthropogenic food resources increased near the colony (positive ΔK). As a consequence, given no reduction in landfill activity or in accessibility for gulls, we expect this region to sustain continuous species expansion in the future.

Intensive long-term monitoring of a leatherback nesting population on Sandy Point (St. Croix, US Virgin Islands) offers a unique opportunity to quantify basic population parameters and evaluate effectiveness of nesting beach conservation practices. We report a significant increase in the number of females nesting annually from ca. 18-30 in the 1980s to 186 in 2001, with a corresponding increase in annual hatchling production from ca. 2000 to over 49,000. We then analyzed resighting data from 1991 to 2001 with an open robust-design capture-mark-recapture model to estimate annual nester survival and adult abundance for this population. The expected annual survival probability was estimated at ca. 0.893 (95% CL 0.87-0.92) and the population was estimated to be increasing ca. 13% pa since the early 1990s. Taken together with DNA fingerprinting that identify mother-daughter relations, our findings suggest that the increase in the size of the nesting population since 1991 was probably due to an aggressive program of beach protection and egg relocation initiated more than 20 years ago.

2254,Population size and trend of yellow-billed loons in northern Alaska,"The Yellow-billed Loon (Gavia adamsii) is of conservation concern due to its restricted range, small population size, specific habitat requirements, and perceived threats to its breeding and wintering habitat. Within the U.S., this species breeds almost entirely within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, nearly all of which is open, or proposed to be opened, for oil development. Rigorous estimates of Yellow-billed Loon population size and trend are lacking but essential for informed conservation. We used two annual aerial waterfowl surveys, conducted 1986-2003 and 1992-2003, to estimate population size and trend on northern Alaskan breeding grounds. In estimating population trend, we used mixed-effects regression models to reduce bias and sampling error associated with improvement in observer skill and annual effects of spring phenology. The estimated population trend on Alaskan breeding grounds since 1986 was near 0 with an estimated annual change of -0.9% (95% CI of -3.6% to +1.8%). The estimated population size, averaged over the past 12 years and adjusted by a correction factor based on an intensive, lake-circling, aerial survey method, was 2221 individuals (95% CI of 1206-3235) in early June and 3369 individuals (95% CI of 1910-4828) in late June. Based on estimates from other studies of the proportion of loons nesting in a given year, it is likely that <1000 nesting pairs inhabit northern Alaska in most years.

At the end of the growing season, in autumn, the size of the 0+ salmon ranged from a mean weight of 1.12 g in 1966 to 2.82 g in 1973, and the size of the 0+ trout ranged from a mean of 2.20 g in 1966 to 3.56 g (68.0 mm) in 1974. Growth rates of 0+ salmon between July to September were similar from year to year, as was the case with the 0+ trout. The greater size attained in their first year by trout, resulted from the longer feeding season, provided by earlier emergence of fry and ability to continue growing in colder weather in autumn. The lengths attained by 0+ salmon and 0+ trout in September were related to the population densities of 0+ salmon and the number of days above 0° C from 1 December. There was no discernible relationship between lengths of 0+ trout and the population densities of 0+ trout. Salmon and trout lost weight during the winter, which was made up by April.

3827,Long-Term Variation in Small Mammal Abundance in Forest and Savanna of Bolivian Cerrado,"Small mammals were trapped annually in two savanna and two forest plots in cerrado habitats of Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, Santa Cruz, Bolivia, for 510 yr. Eighteen species were captured in forest and seven species in savanna. Species numbers and total number of individuals captured were tightly correlated. In forest, species and abundance varied interannually by up to fourfold in one plot and to 100-fold in the other, and showed alternating highs and lows as is typical for small mammals. The largest faunal differences were due not to site differences, but to year differences, with markedly different patterns in forests and savannas. Abundance was not correlated with rainfall overall, but showed correlation in exceptional years of rainfall and ENSO drought. In savanna, species and overall abundance declined without recovery during 3 yr after reaching minimum numbers in 2004. One species, Cavia aperea, became extinct on both plots, and subsequently, apparently on the entire savanna. Both herbivorous and insectivorous species declined together. Rainfall, fire, and flooding do not seem to account for savanna rodent declines.

544,Status of the Pacific walrus population 1950-1989.,"The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) population is an important ecological and economic resource of the Bering Sea region. We describe population change, beginning with a low in 1950, through a high in about 1980, and ending in 1989. Estimates of abundance for the years after 1989 were not attempted due to the lack of harvest data and other population parameters. Selective hunting practices resulted in biased data regarding population composition and reproductive performance. Rates of reproduction had to be estimated from ovarian data, which indicated a dramatic drop in the 1980s.

3027,Photographic mark–recapture analysis of local dynamics within an open population of dolphins,"Identifying demographic changes is important for understanding population dynamics. However, this requires long-term studies of definable populations of distinct individuals, which can be particularly challenging when studying mobile cetaceans in the marine environment. We collected photo-identification data from 19 years (19922010) to assess the dynamics of a population of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) restricted to the shallow (<7 m) waters of Little Bahama Bank, northern Bahamas. This population was known to range beyond our study area, so we adopted a Bayesian mixture modeling approach to markrecapture to identify clusters of individuals that used the area to different extents, and we specifically estimated trends in survival, recruitment, and abundance of a resident population with high probabilities of identification. There was a high probability (p=0.97) of a long-term decrease in the size of this resident population from a maximum of 47 dolphins (95% highest posterior density intervals, HPDI = 2961) in 1996 to a minimum of just 24 dolphins (95% HPDI = 1437) in 2009, a decline of 49% (95% HPDI = - 5% to -75%). This was driven by low per capita recruitment (average ~0.02) that could not compensate for relatively low apparent survival rates (average ~0.94). Notably, there was a significant increase in apparent mortality (~5 apparent mortalities vs. ~2 on average) in 1999 when two intense hurricanes passed over the study area, with a high probability (p = 0.83) of a drop below the average survival probability (~0.91 in 1999; ~0.94, on average).

4480,Raja asterias population assessment in FAO GFCM GSA17 area,"Population structure and distribution of the starry ray, Raja asterias, were described based on data collected during yearly rapido trawl surveys (SoleMon), between 2005 and 2014 in the Northern and Central Adriatic Sea. A total of 306 individuals was caught, sex ratio was 1.04:1 in favor of males and length-weight relationships were obtained for the complete sample. Following the MEDITS scale, maturity was estimated, detecting a higher number of immature individuals. Relative abundance significantly increased during the last five years with the highest values recorded at 5-30 m depths. Such increase could be related to the response of R. asterias to climatic change or to the decrease in fishing pressure in the area. Clear spatial segregation of individuals depending upon their life stage was observed, with immature individuals inhabiting the coastal areas and adults being more abundant at depths greater than 40 m. Comparison of the results of the present study with MEDITS survey outcomes in terms of distribution patterns, persistence areas of adults and juveniles, and abundances indices, indicates that the SoleMon survey seems to be more suitable in defining such features of the stock, likely due to the greater catchability of the rapido trawl in respect to the MEDITS trawl net.

2550,Patterns and ecosystem consequences of shark declines in the ocean,"Whereas many land predators disappeared before their ecological roles were studied, the decline of marine apex predators is still unfolding. Large sharks in particular have experienced rapid declines over the last decades. In this study, we review the documented changes in exploited elasmobranch communities in coastal, demersal, and pelagic habitats, and synthesize the effects of sharks on their prey and wider communities. We show that the high natural diversity and abundance of sharks is vulnerable to even light fishing pressure. The decline of large predatory sharks reduces natural mortality in a range of prey, contributing to changes in abundance, distribution, and behaviour of small elasmobranchs, marine mammals, and sea turtles that have few other predators. Through direct predation and behavioural modifications, top-down effects of sharks have led to cascading changes in some coastal ecosystems. In demersal and pelagic communities, there is increasing evidence of mesopredator release, but cascading effects are more hypothetical. Here, fishing pressure on mesopredators may mask or even reverse some ecosystem effects. In conclusion, large sharks can exert strong top-down forces with the potential to shape marine communities over large spatial and temporal scales.

Uncontrolled harvest of long-lived species with delayed sexual maturity may lead to long-term declines in populations. We analyzed a 17-year data set from a mark-recapture study on an unharvested population of the Common Snapping Turtle in Canaan Valley, West Virginia. We captured 91 snapping turtles (47 female, 44 male).

The estimated annual survival was 0.97 and the annual capture probability was 0.11. We found that the best performing model involved constant survival and capture probability that varied based on the mass at initial capture.

The Italian roe deer Capreolus capreolus italicus was recently confirmed to be a subspecies in Mediterranean habitats of central and southern Italy. We have monitored this subspecies at Castelporziano, near Rome, since 1988, and detected an abrupt population decline in 2001. We compared distance sampling surveys undertaken before and after the population crash to determine the ability of this method to detect variations in animal density and to investigate which factors may influence the precision of the estimates. We used radio tagged roe deer to evaluate the accuracy of our surveys, comparing distance sampling and mark-resight estimates at the same site, and studying the behavioural reaction of the animals to the presence of an observer. We found that before the crash distance sampling surveys attained a good precision but that the survey conditions influenced both precision and accuracy. Post-crash surveys were less precise, but the difference in density, before and after the crash was highly significant, indicating the potential of the method to quickly detect density variations and so to allow wildlife managers to react without delay to a crisis. The direct test of distance sampling assumptions showed that estimates were almost unbiased.

Our aims were to develop models to assess (1) the colony growth rate, and (2) apparent survival rate of a colony of little egrets breeding in northern Iberia. We used capture-recapture data of little egrets ringed as chicks within the colony, of normally < 30 adult breeding pairs, over a 14-year period starting in 1999. Colony size was observed to be increasing in a linear tendency broken by specific catastrophic events: a very strong hailstorm in 2004 and a pair of peregrines Falco peregrinus that killed several adults in 2005. By 2012, the colony had still not reached the size that it was before the decrease, so it can be concluded that sporadic catastrophic events can have a significant effect on colony size and subsequently population size, especially in small colonies. Annual apparent survival (±SE) was constant and differed between age classes (first-years: 0.15 ± 0.05; adults: 0.78 ± 0.06).

2795,"Trends in common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) and anchovy (Engraulis ringens) biomass, central-southern Chile, 1991-2005","Common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) and anchovy (Engraulis ringens) constitute the main commercial small pelagic fishing activity in central-southern Chile, with average annual catches between 1991 and 2005 of 342,000 tons (common sardine) and 405,000 tons (anchovy). Abundance estimates for these species were obtained through statistical models of catch by age. These models incorporate information on annual catches, catch by unit of effort, biomass estimated by acoustic methods, size structure, and biological information (growth parameters, maturity, weight). Parameter estimates were done using maximum verosimilitude methods. The analysis of the structure by age of sardine and anchovy catches shows a high presence of recruits and adult fraction that has decreased over time. The abundance levels were especially low for common sardine; the 2005 spawning biomass was 207,600 tons, as compared to the 485,000 tons estimated in 1991. Common sardine recruitment (age group 0) was currently found to be 280,600 tons, lower than the 392,000 tons estimated at the beginning of the study period.

918,Gray Whales and the value of monitoring data in implementing the U.S. Endangered Species Act,"Many scientists lament the absence of data for endangered species and argue that more funds should be spent acquiring basic information about population trends. Using 19 years of abundance estimates for the eastern North Pacific gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), we sampled subsets of the Original survey data to identify the number of years of data required to remove the population from the U.S. Endangered Species Act's (ESA) list of endangered and threatened wildlife. For any given duration of monitoring, we selected all possible combinations of consecutive counts. To incorporate variability in growth rates, we extracted a maximum likelihood estimator of growth rate and confidence interval about that growth rate on the assumption that the population changes can be approximated by a simple diffusion process with drift. We then applied a new approach to determine ESA status for each subset of survey data and found that a quantitative decision to delist is unambiguously supported by 11 years of data but is precariously uncertain with fewer than 10 years of data. The data needed to produce an unequivocal decision to delist gray whales cost the National Marine Fisheries Service an estimated U.S. $660,000, a surprisingly modest expense given the fact that delisting can greatly simplify regulatory constraints. This example highlights the value of population monitoring in administering the ESA and provides a compelling example of the utility of such information in identifying both imperiled and recovered species.

Based on size at first capture, we caught 119 adult (>= 90 mm snout-vent length (SVL)) and 430 hatchling/juvenile ( 90 mm SVL) males, and 139 adult and 390 hatchling/juvenile females. Sex ratio of males to females was 1.04 (549 males/529 females). Adult G. sila generally became active in April, and activity remained relatively high into July. Hatchlings were first noted in either July or August and generally could be found until early November, except in 1990 when no hatchlings were found at any time. Mean number of adults and hatchlings found active each day differed significantly across years, but as many as 32 adults and 42 hatchlings were seen on a plot during a census. Estimates of population abundance on a plot also varied yearly from 20-164 adults and 0-273 hatchling/juveniles and seemed to be affected either by too little or too much rain. Differences in daily activity varied and were moderately well explained by environmental factors. We estimated survivorship of lizards and found 29.0% of hatchlings from 1992 survived to 1993, and 14.6% of hatchlings from 1993 survived to 1994. The oldest G. sila found was a female estimated to be 4 years, 10 months when last caught, although most adults were not seen after 2 yr.

1456,Population trends and spatial synchrony in peripheral populations of the endangered Lesser grey shrike in response to environmental change.,"Regional synchronization in species dynamics as well as particular ecological and demographic characteristics of peripheral populations poses special challenges for conservation purposes, particularly under the current scenario of global climate change. Here, we study the population trend and spatial synchrony of several peripheral populations of the endangered Lesser grey shrike Lanius minor at the western limit of its breeding range (southern France and northeast Spain). In an attempt to ascertain the effect of environmental change on the decline of the species we also look for evidence of climate changes in the breeding and wintering area of this shrike and related effects on vegetation by using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We found that the interannual fluctuations of the peripheral populations in France and Spain are strongly correlated, therefore suggesting that their decline can be under the influence of a common factor. We obtained clear evidence of climatic change (an increased thermal oscillation) in one peripheral population that could have resulted in a decrease of the NDVI index in the area. Our study finds correlational evidence that climatic variables in the breeding area may account for fluctuations in abundances of some populations and that environmental conditions experimented by some population could influence the fate of the neighboring populations. Our results indicate that the studied peripheral populations are spatially synchronized, so that conservation efforts should be applied at a large-scale encompassing all the isolated populations at the western border of the range of the species in the Mediterranean area.

Estimated carrying capacity is 0.1-0.5 elephants km-2 but stocking rates have been up to 4 elephants km-2. Population growth rate was found to be positively correlated with increasing density. There was no relationship between birth rate, the age of first calving or calf sex ratio and elephant density but there was a positive relationship between birth rate and rainfall during conception year. Mortality rates, particularly for juveniles, were low, and mean inter-calf interval was 3.3 years. There is no evidence of density dependent regulation in this population, despite the population being consistently above the estimated sustainable carrying capacity and a loss of phytomass and biodiversity. This is interpreted in light of the characteristics of the aseasonal habitat, succulent thicket vegetation and the ability of elephants to utilize accumulated vegetation biomass.

Ozark cavefish survey data spanning almost a century were analyzed for temporal trends using the Mann-Kendall Test/Sen's Slope Estimator Method. Results were inconclusive because variance was high and the majority of data sets were not sufficiently large to detect a trend. However, the two largest populations (Cave Springs Cave and Logan Cave, Benton Co., Arkansas) have stabilizing or increasing survey counts. While the number of active cavefish sites has decreased over 50% since 1990, the number of surveyed individuals has not. Reasons for endangerment were reanalyzed since federal listing; the primary threat has shifted from overcollection to habitat degradation. We analyzed the progress of recovery task implementation, and we critically evaluated the basis of delisting criteria.

Recovery Task 2 prescribes protection and management for Recovery Caves, and important progress has been made. Recovery Task 3 involves the development and implementation of monitoring programs in Recovery Caves. Several important studies have been performed, and indicate that many cavefish populations are experiencing chronic, low-level exposure to a suite of anthropogenic contaminants.

172,"Threats to Burdur Lake ecosystem, Turkey and its waterbirds, particularly the white-headed duck Oxyura leucocephala","Burdur Lake, a closed-basin saline lake in south-west Anatolia, Turkey, is internationally important for its wintering waterbirds. It is the most important wintering site in the world for the white-headed duck Oxyura leucocephala, a globally threatened species. It has also held internationally important numbers of 10 other waterbird species. The lake is threatened by the construction of an industrial complex and airport on the northern shore. Falling water levels (from construction of upstream dams), sedimentation (from catchment erosion), organic pollution (from food processing and sewage) and inorganic effluent (from a sulphur mine) represent long-term threats to the lake system. Illegal hunting from the shore has a serious impact upon white-headed ducks, which concentrate close inshore and show little escape response in the presence of hunters. White-headed duck numbers have fluctuated considerably since 1967 with a peak (incomplete) count of 10,927 in February 1991. By January 1995, numbers had declined to 2805. Numbers of black-necked grebe Podiceps nigricollis, white-fronted goose Anser albifrons and tufted duck Aythya fuligula have declined. Numbers of large gulls of the Larus argentatus group which prey upon white-headed duck have increased, possibly due to pollution.

1765,Conservation and conflict between endangered desert fishes,"Conservation of naturally sympatric endangered species requires unique considerations. While impacts of invasive species garner much attention, interactions between endangered species must also be managed.

Here, we document interactions between these species, finding significantly more G. nobilis accumulated at pupfish spawning events than randomly distributed on breeding grounds in the absence of spawning. As a known egg predator, our results suggest that G. nobilis presence at spawnings may further decrease pupfish numbers while also altering the evolutionary dynamics of C. bovinus breeding tactics.

2720,Habitat selection and population trends in terrestrial bird species of Robinson Crusoe Island: habitat generalists versus forest specialists,"Habitat loss and degradation on oceanic islands are key processes leading to population decline of endemic birds and facilitating the establishment of invasive bird species. In this study, carried out in the Robinson Crusoe Island, we assessed density and habitat selection of terrestrial bird species, including juan fernandez firecrown and juan fernandez tit-tyrant, two endemics, as well as green-backed firecrown and austral thrush, which apparently originate from the mainland. Results show that perturbed habitats contained a low density of the endemic species whereas the mainland species were significantly more abundant in perturbed scrub habitats. Bird species show different habitat selection patterns, with endemics selecting for native forest and mainland species selecting for perturbed habitats, or using them at random. Bird species experienced temporal trends in their overall population sizes, with the endemic tit-tyrant suffering a significant decline in its population size of about 63% between 1994 and 2009. Only mainland species exhibited temporal changes in habitat use, significantly reducing their densities in the preferred scrub habitats, possibly as a response to decreased habitat quality. Thrushes apparently were able to compensate the population decrease in one non native habitat type by using native forests, a habitat giving them the opportunity of preying on nests of endemic species.

Predation of artificial (chicken egg) tortoise nests increased, and the relative frequency of juveniles (about 1% of samples) was lower than after severe habitat destruction or pesticide damage.

2974,Community-based conservation results in the recovery of reef fish spawning aggregations in the Coral Triangle,"In the Coral Triangle community-based marine protected areas (MPAs) are being established at a prolific rate. Their establishment can benefit both fisheries and biodiversity, and they provide both a socially and economically acceptable means of managing coral reefs in developing nations. However, because such MPAs are typically small (usually <0.5km2), they will rarely provide protection to large mobile fishes. An exception to this limitation may exist when community-based MPAs are established to protect small sites where vital processes occur, such as fish spawning aggregations (FSAs). To test the effectiveness of small (0.1-0.2km2) MPAs for protecting FSAs, we monitored three FSA sites where brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus), camouflage grouper (Epinephelus polyphekadion) and squaretail coralgrouper (Plectropomus areolatus) aggregate to spawn. Sites were monitored during peak reproductive periods (several days prior to each new moon) between January 2005 and November 2009. All three sites are located in New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea, and had been exploited for decades, but in 2004 two sites were protected by the establishment of community-based MPAs. The third site continued to be exploited. Over the monitoring period densities of E. fuscoguttatus and E. polyphekadion increased at both MPAs, but not at the site that remained open to fishing. At one MPA the densities of E. polyphekadion increased tenfold. Our findings demonstrate that community-based MPAs that are appropriately designed and adequately enforced can lead to the recovery of populations of vulnerable species that aggregate to spawn.

All three sites are located in New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea, and had been exploited for decades, but in 2004 two sites were protected by the establishment of community-based MPAs. The third site continued to be exploited. Over the monitoring period densities of E. fuscoguttatus and E. polyphekadion increased at both MPAs, but not at the site that remained open to fishing.

2643,Status of grey seals along mainland Europe from the southwestern Baltic to France,"The grey seal was a common species along mainland Europe during the Stone Age (8,000-5,500 BC). Along the North Sea coast populations started to decline substantially during the 11th century as a result of excessive hunting. The last breeding populations disappeared in the 16th century in the Wadden Sea, and before 1900 in the Kattegat-Skagerrak and the Southwestern Baltic as a result of an extermination campaign. No regular pupping occurred along mainland Europe until the end of the 1970s, when a breeding colony was established near Amrum in the German Wadden Sea. Somewhat later, additional breeding sites were discovered near Terschelling in the Dutch Wadden Sea (1980), at Helgoland, and off Brittany in France. Tracking of movements indicate these seal groups to be linked to the larger populations in the UK. Numbers of grey seals in the recolonised areas have increased over the years, but in the Kattegat-Skagerrak stable numbers of about 25 individuals have been observed since the 1970s, whereas more than 100 grey seals are found in the Southwestern Baltic.

1551,"Using annual body size fluctuations to explore potential causes for the decline in a nesting population of the loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta at Senri Beach, Japan","The annual recruitment dynamics and body size fluctuations in adult female loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta nesting on Senri Beach in Minabe, Japan from 1990 to 2001 were investigated along with the number of nests, so that the causes for the recent population decline could be assessed. The number of nests decreased from 335 in 1990 to 29 in 1998, and slightly increased thereafter. The recruit percentage (i. e. the percentage of recruits out of total identified females in each year) varied from 39 to 75%. The lack of a significant correlation between the rates of change in the recruit percentage and in the number of nests suggested that the population decline had been caused by factors affecting both recruits and remigrants. The mean straight carapace length (SCL) varied from 825 to 855 mm. The significant negative correlation between the rates of change in the mean SCL and in the number of nests suggested that the decline had been caused by the decrease in the number of small females. The lack of a significant difference in SCL between recruits and remigrants supported the above scenarios.

We constructed a set of generalized linear models of factors affecting population growth, and used Akaike Information Criteria to guide model selection and inference. In the low wolf predation zone, elk population growth was density-dependent and limited by human-caused mortality. In the zone that wolves recolonized in 1991, elk population growth was limited by the combined effects of snow depth and wolf predation after wolf recolonization, in addition to preexisting mortality caused by humans and other predators.

853,Diagnosing a shorebird local population decline with a stage-structured population model,"The breeding population of Semipalmated Sandpipers at La Perouse Bay, Churchill, Manitoba declined sharply during the 1980s. Using demographic information collected during eight summers of field work we built a stochastic matrix population model. The model successfully reconstructed the observed decline in the population during the course of the study. The predictions of the model agreed with the observed population level in 1993, 5 yr after the study was completed. Sensitivity analysis showed that the population trend was most sensitive to changes in adult survivorship and to immigration of adults onto the site. We ran simulations to consider five possible reasons for the decline: (1) low adult survivorship, (2) low fecundity, (3) delayed recruitment into the population, (4) low juvenile survivorship, and (5) insufficient immigration. For biologically reasonable values of these parameters, only adult survivorship and immigration rates could account for the observed decline, although juvenile survival also had some impact. These simulations also illustrate that sensitivity is a complex function of the demographic variables, and in particular, sensitivity to adult survival varies across the range of adult survival values that we considered. In addition, we used the model to explore the influence of annual variability in demographic parameters. It is known that the general effect of annual variation is to depress population trends. We showed that the sensitivity of the model to annual variability in survival is tied to the sensitivity of the model to changes in mean values of survival. With the empirical parameter values from this local population, we found that, when survival is high enough to promote stability of the population, the population is highly sensitive to the level of survival, and also to the amount of annual variability in survival.

We conducted a census of nesting activity at Jamursba-Medi from 2001 through 2004 and of Wermon from 2002 to 2004, and tracked internesting movements of female leatherbacks by using satellite telemetry during the nesting season in 2003. We recorded 1865-3601 nests each season at Jamursba-Medi and 1788-2881 nests at Wermon. Nesting occurred year-round, with a peak in activity between May and September at Jamursba-Medi, and between October and March at Wermon. Comparing these data with previous records of nesting activity from 1981 to 2001 indicates that, although there are indications of a long-term decline, this population has not been depleted to the extent found at other major rookeries in the Pacific. Satellite telemetry indicates that nesters frequent waters around the Raja Ampat Islands and coastal waters to the west of Jamursba-Medi, and may also nest outside the monitored area. We recommend establishing a marine protected area to ensure protection of this population in these critical nearshore marine habitats and implementation of conservation measures in partnership with local communities at these nesting beaches before this population becomes depleted.

1908,"Avoiding aliens: Behavioural plasticity in habitat use enables large, nocturnal geckos to survive Pacific rat invasions","Rodents are efficient invaders on a global scale and pose a significant threat to native biotas, particularly in systems such as oceanic islands which support a reduced suite of mammals. Pacific rats (Rattus exulans) are implicated in extinctions, range restrictions and declines of vulnerable endemic faunas throughout the Pacific. However, research into the behavioural and ecological modifications that enable native species to persist in the presence of Pacific rats is scant. We examined the population structure, behaviour and microhabitat use of Duvaucel's geckos (Hoplodactylus duvauceiii; radio-telemetry), and Pacific rats (spool-and-line tracking) on three New Zealand offshore islands with different histories of rat incursions and eradication: (1) Green island, historically rat-free, (2) Korapuki, from which rats were eradicated 20 years ago, and (3) Ohinau, before and 6 months after rat eradication. Although Pacific rats and Duvaucel's geckos shared habitat at a broad spatial scale, little overlap in micro-habitat use existed where they were sympatric. In the presence of rats, Duvaucel's gecko capture rates and recruitment were reduced. However, 6 months after rat eradication, and prior to any recruitment, capture rates of adult geckos increased fourfold and geckos were using a greater proportion of habitat preferred by rats. Thus, we provide strong empirical evidence that Pacific rats ecologically displace Duvaucel's geckos. Highly plastic spatial avoidance behaviour by native prey species in response to the presence of introduced rodents may enable geckos to persist in sympatry with rodents at least in the short-term.

3704,"Environmental predictors and temporal patterns of basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) occurence in the lower Bay of Fundy, Canada","Little is currently known about the population dynamics of basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) at regional or local scales. Using a long-termsighting database (19942012) and photo-identification of individuals,we studied the seasonal and inter-annual patterns in basking shark occurrence and site fidelity in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Zero-inflated negative binomial models quantified spatial, temporal and environmental predictors of shark sighting rates. The probability of sighting a basking shark increased in August, and in deep water offshore; this may reflect the distribution and availability of calanoid copepod prey. Sea-surface temperature (SST) had no effects on shark sightings, but there was a negative correlation between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and shark sightings lagged at two and four years; the former possibly due to the position of the Gulf Stream and the latter likely a result of the lagged influence of the NAO on copepod abundance. The model also showed a significant decline in the occurrence of basking sharks within the Bay of Fundy over the study period. From unique markings on dorsal fins, 98 individual sharks were identified from photographs taken between 1997 and 2012. Four of these individuals were re-sighted in subsequent years, and the longest interval between re-sightings was 9.1 years.

3159,Populatietrends van overwinterende en doortrekkende watervogels in Nederland in 1975-2010,"Despite its small size, The Netherlands support large numbers of waterbirds and are an important cross-road of migration routes within Europe. Its large wetlands and highly productive agricultural landscape attract up to five million waterbirds, of which two million geese. Of several species (e.g. Bewick's Swan, Pink-footed Goose, Greater White-fronted Goose, Barnacle Goose, Red Knot) this involves major parts of the flyway populations. Waterbird surveys, involving many volunteer observers, have a long history in The Netherlands and nowadays are part of a national governmental monitoring scheme. They consist of monthly counts in the relevant parts of the year and main sites, augmented by a midwinter count covering much of the remaining wetlands and agricultural areas (Tab.1). Usually counts are carried out during daytime on the feeding grounds, but as several areas were designated as Natura 2000 sites for roosting birds, counts of night-roosts have recently been established as well. In some species (e.g. Great White Egret) roost counts provide better estimates of the wintering population than counts of foraging areas during daytime. This paper summarises 35 years of waterbird counts in The Netherlands. A major part of this period was characterised by exceptionally mild winters (Fig. 1), partly in a long row which only recently was broken. Table 3 summarises by species the observed trends (in seasonal averages, i.e. the sum of all annual counts divided by 12) over the past 30 and 10 years, and counted as well as estimated seasonal peak numbers and the month(s) in which they occur. The latter include numbers imputed for missing counts and estimates for non-counted areas. Waterbird numbers in The Netherlands showed a twofold increase in the past 30 years, with most rapid increases in the 1990s and around 2000 (Fig. 9). Several goose species, Mute Swan and Great Cormorant dominate this increase, whereas ducks only slightly increased and waders fluctuated without a clear common trend. During the past decade, 31% of the species were still increasing, whereas 25% declined and 25% were stable. Among the species with the most rapid increases are Greater Canada Goose (Fig. 2), Egyptian Goose, Great White Egret, Red-crested Pochard and Slavonian Grebe. Steepest declines occurred in Taiga Bean Goose, Common Eider, Common Scoter, Bewick's Swan, Ruff and Kentish Plover. Drivers of the observed population are diverse. In a number of species, changes in The Netherlands suggests an impact of warming (winter) climate (declines in e.g. Taiga Bean Goose, Mallard, Common Pochard, Greater Scaup, Smew, Goosander; increases in e.g. Northern Shoveler and Grey Plover). In other species, breeding success in artic breeding areas decreased, leading to lower numbers in e.g. Bewick's Swan and Dark-bellied Brent Goose. Breeding success in Tundra Bean Goose and Greater-White-fronted Goose also declined in the past decade, but so far this has not resulted in lower numbers in The Netherlands. Particularly in geese, numbers observed in The Netherlands also rely on conditions elsewhere in the flyway as they easily switch between wintering and stop-over sites in NW-Europe, as it is observed in Pink-footed Goose (recent increase in Denmark and decline in The Netherlands) and Tundra Bean Goose (influx in The Netherlands during cold winters).",921,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,Increase,Increase,Increase,Increase,0.00582081028759355,0.0020428146097698,0.0095988059654173,0.00192758423502886,0.0025298869938764103,9,Increase,Increase,Populatietrends van overwinterende en doortrekkende watervogels in Nederland in 1975-2010,"Its large wetlands and highly productive agricultural landscape attract up to five million waterbirds, of which two million geese.

It was, therefore, investigated whether the black rhino population of Pilanesberg National Park had become regulated by resource limitation 22 years after introduction in 1979. Inter-calving intervals (which are not restricted to yearly time increments, due to asynchronous reproduction) decreased with an increase in rainfall, while the percentage of male calves born increased with increasing rainfall. The percentage of reproductive cows achieving maternal success increased with increasing density until 0.085 rhinos/km2, after which it decreased. This positive relationship at low densities is largely due to changes in the female age structure and the adult female/male ratio. The age at first calving tended to increase with increasing density, while mortality was not related to rainfall or density. It is concluded that the Pilanesberg black rhino population is showing the first signs of density dependence.

3380,Population status of White sturgeon in the Lower Columbia River within Canada,"The subpopulation of white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus in the Canadian portion of the Columbia River between Hugh L. Keenleyside Dam and the U.S.-Canada border has been identified as endangered, with nearly 30 consecutive years of consistent recruitment failure. The objectives of this study were to determine the status and population attributes of this subpopulation. We estimated survival rates and abundance using catch-curve analysis and mark-recapture models. An annual survival rate of 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88-90%) was estimated for the subpopulation using catch-curve analysis for the time period 1993-2004. The survival rates estimated from the mark-recapture data were obtained using model-averaged parameter estimates from a multistrata Cormack-Jolly-Seber model. The annual survival rate from the mark-recapture model was estimated at 97% (95% CI, 92-99%) from 1993 to 2004. The mark-recapture methods estimated abundance for 2004 to be 1,157 individuals (95% CI, 414-1,900). The mark-recapture data suggest that the white sturgeon have low migration rates, ranging from 3% to 5% among sections of the river. Despite high estimated survival, high uncertainty as to the future viability of the white sturgeon subpopulation in this portion of the river remains, as natural recruitment is poor. The fish continue to age, and size and age-frequency data suggest that recruitment failure continues in this subpopulation with minimal presence of wild juvenile or subadult white sturgeon detected.

The mark-recapture methods estimated abundance for 2004 to be 1,157 individuals (95% CI, 414-1,900). The mark-recapture data suggest that the white sturgeon have low migration rates, ranging from 3% to 5% among sections of the river.

2585,"Mating Behavior, Population Growth, and the Operational Sex Ratio: A Periodic Two‐Sex Model Approach",": We present a new approach to modeling two?sex populations, using periodic, nonlinear two?sex matrix models. The models project the population growth rate, the population structure, and any ratio of interest (e.g., operational sex ratio). The periodic formulation permits inclusion of highly seasonal behavioral events. A periodic product of the seasonal matrices describes annual population dynamics. The model is nonlinear because mating probability depends on the structure of the population. To study how the vital rates influence population growth rate, population structure, and operational sex ratio, we used sensitivity analysis of frequency?dependent nonlinear models. In nonlinear two?sex models the vital rates affect growth rate directly and also indirectly through effects on the population structure. The indirect effects can sometimes overwhelm the direct effects and are revealed only by nonlinear analysis. We find that the sensitivity of the population growth rate to female survival is negative for the emperor penguin, a species with highly seasonal breeding behavior. This result could not occur in linear models because changes in population structure have no effect on per capita reproduction. Our approach is applicable to ecological and evolutionary studies of any species in which males and females interact in a seasonal environment.",655,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,-0.00857244325820836,-0.010751322946879,-0.0063935635695377205,,6.79171981300092e-10,1,Decline,Decline,"Mating Behavior, Population Growth, and the Operational Sex Ratio: A Periodic Two‐Sex Model Approach","The models project the population growth rate, the population structure, and any ratio of interest (e.g., operational sex ratio).

2337,"Gray-headed Lemur (Eulemur cinereiceps) Abundance and Forest Structure Dynamics at Manombo, Madagascar","Madagascar's ecosystems are subject to high levels of anthropogenic disturbance and stochastic events, including cyclones. We investigated the abundance of gray-headed lemurs (Eulemur cinereiceps) and vegetation structure in the fragmented forest of Manombo from 1995 to 2007, including 10yr following Cyclone Gretelle in January 1997. We predicted that the density of this arboreal, frugivorous lemur would be similar in the pre- and post-cyclone intervals only if tree measures demonstrate trends toward recovery in the post-cyclone period. Initial impacts included severe damage to over 60 percent of trees. After 10yr, all vegetation metrics except for stem density remained low relative to the pre-cyclone period, including dbh, height, and basal area. To investigate vegetation changes separately from cyclone effects, we compared forest structure in the pre-cyclone period alone. Basal area declined but dbh and stem density did not vary between 1995 and 1997; thus, anthropogenic activities or other factors did not consistently alter forest structure in this 2-yr period. Subsequent changes may be linked to cyclone response, presumably in synergy with human disturbance. Contrary to predictions, recent gray-headed lemur population densities were nearly identical to those recorded in 1995 (13.5 ± 3.2 vs. 13.6 ± 6.4 individuals/km2, respectively). Lemur populations may have remained stable or declined initially and then recovered in the last 10yr. Life history and ecological adaptations may explain their resistance or resilience when faced with habitat change. Recent models suggest that lemurs have evolved in response to unpredictable environmental conditions. Such environmental variability may increase with projected climate change.

1905,Temporal trends in elephant Loxodonta africana numbers and densities in northern Botswana: is the population really increasing?,"The apparent increase in elephant Loxodonta africana numbers in northern Botswana is of concern because it may affect other species. We compared changes in population growth rates based on elephant numbers and densities over 1973-2004. Population estimates and survey details extracted from published and unpublished sources allowed us to calculate growth rates. From 1973 to 1993 growth rate was positive when based on elephant numbers but did not differ from zero when calculated for densities. This discrepancy may be because of the significant increase in survey area during the same period. In contrast, none of the growth rates differed from zero for time series between 1996 and 2004, when the size of the survey area varied little. We propose two explanations for these results. The first suggests that the population did not grow, while the second proposes that the population expanded its range and increased in size. Notwithstanding, an equilibrium model best explained the variance in dry season estimates of elephant numbers for the complete time series.

3833,Global population collapse in a superabundant migratory bird and illegal trapping in China,"Persecution and overexploitation by humans are major causes of species extinctions. Rare species, often confined to small geographic ranges, are usually at highest risk, whereas extinctions of superabundant species with very large ranges are rare. The Yellow-breasted Bunting (Emberiza aureola) used to be one of the most abundant songbirds of the Palearctic, with a very large breeding range stretching from Scandinavia to the Russian Far East. Anecdotal information about rapid population declines across the range caused concern about unsustainable trapping along the species migration routes. We conducted a literature review and used long-term monitoring data from across the species range to model population trend and geographical patterns of extinction. The population declined by 84.394.7% between 1980 and 2013, and the species range contracted by 5000 km. Quantitative evidence from police raids suggested rampant illegal trapping of the species along its East Asian flyway in China. A population model simulating an initial harvest level of 2% of the population, and an annual increase of 0.2% during the monitoring period produced a population trajectory that matched the observed decline. We suggest that trapping strongly contributed to the decline because the consumption of Yellow-breasted Bunting and other songbirds has increased as a result of economic growth and prosperity in East Asia. The magnitude and speed of the decline is unprecedented among birds with a comparable range size, with the exception of the Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), which went extinct in 1914 due to industrial-scale hunting.

3208,Population trends of common wintering waterfowl in Japan: participatory monitoring data from 1996 to 2009,"We analyzed population trends of 13 waterfowl (Anseriformes) species wintering in Japan during a 14-year period (1996-2009). We used data from annual volunteer-participatory waterfowl count surveys which were conducted in Japan by the Ministry of the Environment and local prefectural governments. Population indices and long-term trends of each species were calculated using TRIM (TRends and Indices for Monitoring data). TRIM is a freeware program developed for analysis of time series count data with missing observations. During the 14 years, seven species exhibited significant long-term declines, while four species showed long-term increases. Most of the species that showed long term declines were characterized as being water-surface foraging species, species breeding in both middle and high latitude regions, or species using rice fields. Most species that showed long-term increases were characterized as diving species, species breeding at high latitude or species rarely using rice fields. We calculated composite indices for these groups. The group of water-surface foraging species showed declines in river, natural lakes and artificial lakes, except reservoirs, when each habitat was analyzed separately. In contrast, the group of diving foraging species showed an increase in estuarine habitat. We suggest that changes in: water quality, breeding habitat in the middle latitude region, and in cultivation methods in rice fields, have affected population changes of some species and groups.

This time-period was characterized by mild and wet winters (except the winter of 1999-2000 which was very dry but remained mild). The mean temperatures were all higher than those measured previously. Twenty-two new species have been recorded for the first time (their list is given in the introduction of this paper).

3438,Partial and clearcut harvesting of dry Douglas-fir forests: Implications for small mammal communities,"Dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests offer a wide range of timber and non-timber values, which may benefit from a balanced timber harvest by variable retention systems with conservation of biodiversity. A major component of biodiversity are forest floor small mammal communities whose abundance and diversity serve as ecological indicators of significant change in forest structure and function from harvesting activities. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that abundance, reproduction, and survival of (i) the southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi, formerly Clethrionomys gapperi), will decline; (ii) the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), will be similar; and (iii) the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and northwestern chipmunk (Tamias amoenus), will increase, with decreasing levels of tree retention. Small mammal populations were live-trapped from 1994 to 1997 in replicated sites of uncut forest, 20% and 50% volume removal by single tree selection, 20%, 35%, and 50% patch cuts based on openings of 0.1-1.6 ha, and small 1.6 ha clearcuts in Douglas-fir forest near Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. M. gapperi dominated the small mammal community, starting with an abundance of 74-98 animals/ha with mean values ranging from 33 to 51 animals/ha. In the two post-harvest years, abundance, reproduction, and survival of M. gapperi populations were consistently similar among uncut forest and the various levels of tree retention. Thereafter, M. gapperi was seldom found on the small clearcuts. M. pennsylvanicus, T. amoenus, and P. maniculatus occurred predominantly in clearcut sites. As with other types of forest disturbance, responses to our treatments were species-specific. The most striking result was the high abundance and productivity of M. gapperi populations in a dry forest ecosystem, a novel result for this bio-indicator species of closed-canopy forest conditions.

990,Breeding of the Seychelles Magpie Robin Copsychus sechellarum and implications for its conservation,"The total population of the Seychelles Magpie Robin Copsychus sechellarum declined from 38-41 birds in 12-13 territories in 1977- 1978 to 17-21 birds in eight to nine territories in 1988-1990 and was entirely confined to Fregate Island (210 ha) in the Seychelles. After a successful cat eradication program in 1981-1982, recruitment improved, although the abandonment of agriculture had caused a reduction in the amount of feeding habitat and hence in the carrying capacity of the island. The population declined because of the failure of recruitment to compensate for the annual adult mortality. Foraging activity of the Magpie Robin was greater in high- quality territories (measured by soil invertebrates available), leading to increased reproductive success. Through supplementary feeding, five times as many recruits were produced. Of the 11.5 potential annual breeding recruits. 5.3 are required to compensate for adult mortality, and the other 6.2 recruits can be regarded as 'surplus' contributing to an increase. Magpie Robins prefer to breed in rotten trees, which are a scarce resource. The greater the distance between the nest site and feeding areas, the less time was spent in incubation and nest guarding, resulting in greater egg loss. Because of lack of suitable areas for establishing territories, many young Magpie Robins became 'floaters'. Nest disturbance, both by these floaters and by the introduced Indian Mynah Acridotheres tristis, had adverse effects on the breeding success of robins. A recovery plan has been designed to save the Magpie Robin. Territories have been improved for feeding (by tree planting) and for breeding (by providing nestboxes and reducing nest disturbances). Given the vulnerability of one small island, the presence of surplus birds (supported mainly by supplementary food) and the suitability of neighbouring Aride Island (68 ha), successful translocations to this island took place in 1992 and 1994.

4424,Seabird breeding population size on the Antarctic Peninsula related to fisheries activities in non-breeding ranges off South America,"Population growth of the southern giant petrel Macronectes giganteus from South America has been linked with an increase in fishing activities. It was demonstrated recently that a population from Elephant Island, Antarctic Peninsula, largely overlaps its non-breeding distribution with zones of high fishing intensity off South America. This study investigated the assumption that the increase in this population since the 1980s is related to an increase in fisheries off South America.

1282,"Two remnant populations of the roofed turtle Kachuga trivittata in the upper Ayeyarwady River system, Myanmar","The endemic roofed turtle Kachuga trivittata has been extirpated over most of its former range in the Ayeyarwady River system of Myanmar. Only two small remnant populations are known to survive. In a small stretch of the upper Chindwin River K. trivittata persists because local Shan villages traditionally ban the killing of large adult K. trivittata. The population has nevertheless declined dramatically during the last few years because of the erosion of the ban by migrant fishermen from central Myanmar who do not observe the local regulation, and because of the overexploitation of eggs. The traditional regulation of the Shan villages offers a basis, through its reinforcement and education of migrants, for a species recovery programme. Further actions will include the protection of nests and eggs, and eventually the banning of camps and seasonal settlements on sandbanks used by K. trivittata for nesting. K. trivittata also still persists in the Dokhtawady River in a small area subjected to low exploitation pressure in the recent past because of the dangers of a frontline between the government army and an army of insurgents. The opening of this area following a truce brought this population close to extinction and a hydroelectric dam under construction will alter the ecology of this stretch of river.

Nine study areas from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to South Padre Island, Texas, were netted at different frequencies and/or years, with capture operations scheduled for at least 1 week per month at one or more areas. Beachfront habitats near Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana, and Sabine Pass, Texas, received 73% of the netting effort and accounted for 97% of the 429 ridleys captured during the study. Headstarted ridleys comprised 6.8% (29 individuals) of these captures, and all were netted at beachfront habitats. Overall ridley catch per unit of effort (CPUE) among all years and study areas was 0.5 ridley/km-hr. CPUEs at beachfront versus bay/pass habitats were 0.6 and 0.1, respectively.

3801,Dynamics of an expanding black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis minor) population,"Understanding population dynamics is critical for meta-population management, especially of endangered species, and also for megaherbivore ecology. We employed complete individual life records to construct census data for a reintroduced black rhinoceros population over 22 years since its founding and investigated its dynamics. Akaikes information criterion applied to scalar models of population growth based on the generalized logistic unambiguously selected an exponential growth model (r?=?0.102?±?0.017), indicating a highly successful reintroduction. No evidence of density dependence was detected, and thus, we could not confirm the threshold model of density dependence that has influenced black rhinoceros meta-population management. Our analysis supported previous work contending that the generalized logistic is unreliable when fitted to data that do not sample the entire range of population sizes. A stage-based matrix model of the exponential population dynamics exhibited mild transient behaviour. We found no evidence of environmental stochasticity, consistent with our previous studies of this population that found no influence of rainfall on demographic parameters. Demographic stochasticity was present, principally reflected in annual sex-specific recruitment numbers that differed from deterministic predictions of the matrix model. Demographically driven process noise should be assumed to be a component of megaherbivore population dynamics, as these populations are typically relatively small, and should be accounted for in managed removals and introductions.

4447,Spatial distribution of common Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) as an indication of a biological hotspot in the East Sea,"The minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is the most common baleen whale among several marine mammal species observed in Korea. Since a high concentrated condition of prey to whales can be obtained by physical structures, the foraging whale distribution can be an indicator of biological hotspot. Our main objective is verifying the coastal upwelling-southwestern East Sea as a productive biological hotspot based on the geographical distribution of minke whales. Among the cetacean research surveys of the National Institute of Fisheries Science since 1999, 9 years data for the minke whales available in the East Sea were used for this study. The regional primary productivity derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used for a proxy of biological productivity. Minke whales observed during the sighting surveys were mostly concentrated in May and found mostly (approximately 70%) in the southwestern coastal areas (< 300m) where high chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity were generally detected. Based on MODIS-derived primary productivity algorithm, the annual primary production (320gCm?2y?1) estimated in the southwestern coastal region of the East Sea belongs to the highly productive coastal upwelling regions in the world. A change in the main spatial distribution of minke whales was found in recent years, which indicate that the major habitats of mink whales have been shifted into the north of the common coastal upwelling regions. This is consistent with the recently reported unprecedented coastal upwelling in the mid-eastern coast of Korea.

2075,Climate and demography of the planktivorous Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus off northern California: implications for population change,"1. We performed demographic analyses on Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus, a zooplanktivorous seabird inhabiting the variable California Current System, to understand how temporal environmental variability influences population dynamics. 2. We used capture-recapture data from 1986 to 2002 to rank models of interannual variation in survival, breeding propensity, breeding success, and recruitment. 3. All demographic parameters exhibited temporal variability. Interannual variation in survival was best modelled as a nonlinear function of the winter Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Breeding propensity was best modelled as a threshold function of local sea surface temperature. Breeding success and recruitment were best modelled with year-dependent annual variation. 4. Changes in the SOI force El Nino/La Nina events, which in turn alter prey availability to seabirds in this system. Demographic responses varied during El Ninos/La Ninas. Survival diminished substantially during the 1997-98 El Nino event, while breeding propensity was affected during both the 1992 and 1998 El Ninos. Breeding success was reduced during the 1992, 1993, and 1998 El Ninos, but was unusually high in 2002. Recruitment was higher at the beginning and end of this time-series. 5.

908,Population dynamics of three Neotropical small mammals: Time series models and the role of delayed density-dependence in population irruptions,"It is widely believed that only precipitation levels (through increased primary production) determine irruptions of small mammals in semi-arid areas of western South America. Nevertheless, density-dependent factors may also drive population fluctuations. To test statistically these putative effects we analysed 11 years of population records on three sympatric species of small mammals at two different habitat types in north central Chile. We applied the classical diagnostic tools of time series analysis (the autocorrelation function: ACF) to the observed time series of three neotropical small mammals. We also used simple linear autoregressive time series models to reconstruct the endogenous dynamics of these populations. The analysis strongly suggests that population fluctuations of the three species have an important density-dependent component, with the most irruptive species (Phyllotis darwini, Waterhouse 1837) displaying stronger second order population feedbacks than the other two (Akodon olivaceus, Waterhouse 1837 and Thylamys elegans, Waterhouse 1839). The latter two species showed direct density-dependent feedbacks. We hypothesize that the frequent population outbreaks of P. darwini (and perhaps of other species) in semi-arid regions of western South America, may be the result of population-level (direct density-dependence) and community-level processes (delayed density-dependence), interacting with exogenous perturbations (rainfall and associated primary production).",108,Decline,Decline,Varied,Decline,Decline,Varied,Varied,Stable,Stable,Stable,-0.0450411896028731,-0.0665549935022408,-0.0235273857035054,0.0109766322590955,4.0717430937002205e-05,6,Decline,Decline,Population dynamics of three Neotropical small mammals: Time series models and the role of delayed density-dependence in population irruptions,"Nevertheless, density-dependent factors may also drive population fluctuations.

3478,"Seasonal pattern of the coastal fish assemblage in Anegada Bay, Argentina.","The seasonal variation of the inshore fish assemblage of Anegada Bay, North Patagonia, Argentina is described here. Three areas were seasonally sampled from 2007 to 2009 by means of a gang of bottom gill-nets. We found 21 coastal fish species, but species richness and fish number and weight changed throughout the year. The six species classified as dominant have national and regional value for artisanal and recreational fishing and were responsible for the seasonal variation in the fish assemblage. Both cluster and non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses based on fish number and fish weight indicated two major sample groups encompassing spring and summer (the warmer seasons) and autumn and winter (the colder seasons). The fish assemblage had higher species richness, dominance and abundance during the warmer seasons than during the colder seasons in the same years and at the same sites. Water temperature was the main environmental factor structuring the fish assemblage in Anegada Bay. We suggest that partial breeding migration toward the bay during warmer months could explain the seasonal pattern observed. Nevertheless, variation in temperature conditions agreed well with the pattern of seasonal changes, leading to an interaction between abiotic and biotic influences in determining the variability in this seasonal fish assemblage. We conclude that an understanding of species temporal and spatial patterns in areas of high ecological and economic value, as exemplified by Anegada Bay, are essential for the implementation of a management approach oriented toward ecosystem sustainability.

1720,Long-term numerical changes and regulation in a river stock of European eel Anguilla anguilla,"1. The objective was to explore the regulatory mechanisms underlying the numerical dynamics of a river stock of European eel Anguilla anguilla based on a purely observational study. We used a 21-year data set on the Rio Esva (Asturias, northwestern Spain) stock of eels, encompassing eel density at an estuary site and at nine sites distributed among three tributaries selected to differ in the distance from the tidal limit and fishery data on glass eels from the nearby Rio Nalón estuary. 2. The abundance of glass eels and estuarine and in-stream densities declined simultaneously over a 15-year period. However, following a historical minimum in the abundance of glass eels around the year 2000, the density continued to decline in the estuary whereas density in the streams began an increase that has continued to the present. 3. In-stream cohort mortality rate (Z) varied from 0.0016 day-1 to only 0.0003 day-1 (on an annual basis from 0.57 to 0.099 year-1). The negative effects of intra-cohort and inter-cohort densities on mortality rate emphasized the responses of the riverine stock to compensatory density-dependence. As a consequence, the number of eels surviving to commence the silvering stage was similar in magnitude in the strongest and weakest cohorts. 4. These results suggest that, even if the low abundance of glass eels persists, in-stream density may increase towards a stable value regulated by in-stream density-dependence.

2016,Reproductive conflict delays the recovery of an endangered social species,"1. Evolutionary theory predicts that individuals, in order to increase their relative fitness, can evolve behaviours that are detrimental for the group or population. This mismatch is particularly visible in social organisms. Despite its potential to affect the population dynamics of social animals, this principle has not yet been applied to real-life conservation. 2. Social group structure has been argued to stabilize population dynamics due to the buffering effects of nonreproducing subordinates. However, competition for breeding positions in such species can also interfere with the reproduction of breeding pairs. 3. Seychelles magpie robins, Copsychus sechellarum, live in social groups where subordinate individuals do not breed. Analysis of long-term individual-based data and short-term behavioural observations show that subordinates increase the territorial takeover frequency of established breeders. Such takeovers delay offspring production and decrease territory productivity. 4. Individual-based simulations of the Seychelles magpie robin population parameterized with the long-term data show that this process has significantly postponed the recovery of the species from the Critically Endangered status. 5.

Grey squirrels are not present on Jersey. Between 1994 and 1997, using trapping and tracking techniques, we studied how red squirrels survive on Jersey by focusing on three local populations in sites B, C and S with contrasting food availability.

4347,,"The 9th National Census of tree breeding Herons colonies in France (7 species) occurred in spring 2007 (completed in 2008) thanks to a network of more than 787 observers belonging to 100 organisations, coordinated by Loïc MARION. The total number of nests reached 66 096 distributed in 1914 species-colonies (in 1387 sites). The Grey Heron was the more abundant (31 138 nests in 1236 colonies), but is levelling-off (+4,89% since 2000). The Purple Heron stopped its decline by increasing by 46% with 2828 nests in 192 colonies. However, the population of the Dombes had to be estimated (390 nests in 50 colonies) due to lack of census. The Black-crowned Night Heron, which also still largely winters in Africa, decreased to 3355 nests in 142 colonies, a drop of 20% in spite of increasing its number of colonies by 60%. Although also migrating, the Squacco Heron pursued its increase (108%) with 576 nests, albeit in only 18 colonies, 11 of which are in the Camargue, then largely limited its range in France.

2495,Wolf survival and population trend using non-invasive capture–recapture techniques in the Western Alps,"Reliable estimates of population parameters are often necessary for conservation management but these are hard to obtain for elusive, rare and wide-ranging species such as wolves Canis lupus. This species has naturally recolonized parts of its former habitat in Western Europe; however, an accurate and cost-effective method to assess population trend and survival has not been implemented yet. We used open-model capture-recapture (CR) sampling with non-invasive individual identifications derived from faecal genotyping to estimate survival and trend in abundance for wolves in the Western Alps between 1999 and 2006. Our sampling strategy reduced individual heterogeneity in recaptures, thus minimizing bias and increasing the precision of the estimates. Young wolves had lower apparent annual survival rates (0·24 ± 0·06) than adult wolves (0·82 ± 0·04); survival rates were lower in the summer than in the winter for both young and adults. The wolf population in the study area increased from 21 ± 9·6 wolves in 1999 to 47 ± 11·2 wolves in late winter 2005; the population growth rate (λ = 1·04 ± 0·27) was lower than that recorded for other recolonizing wolf populations. We found a positive trend in wolf abundance, regardless of the method used. However, the abundance estimate based on snow-tracking was on average 36·2% (SD = 13·6%) lower than that from CR modelling, because young dispersing wolves are likely to have lower sign detection rates in snow-track surveys, a problem adequately addressed by CR sampling. Synthesis and applications. We successfully implemented a new method to assess large carnivore population trend and survival at large spatial scales. These are the first such estimates for wolves in Italy and in the Alps and have important management implications. Our approach can be widely applied to broader spatial and temporal scales for other elusive and wide-ranging species in Europe and elsewhere.

Despite exploitation over several centuries, three species (leatherback Dermochelys coriacea, green Chelonia mydas and hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata turtles) are still nesting and green and hawksbill turtles are found foraging. Leatherback turtles are showing signs of a recovery co-incident with the implementation of an effective moratorium on adult take. When compared with historical data we demonstrate an apparent reduction in nesting levels in green and hawksbill turtles and a nesting range contraction in green turtles. Despite current conservation steps, it will be a decade or more before evidence of recovery can be expected in the two hard-shelled species.

1735,Food regulates the Serengeti wildebeest: a 40-year record,"1. The migratory wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus (Burchell)) population of Serengeti has been monitored for 40 years (1958-1998). The population increased from 1963 to 1977, stabilized from 1977 to 1993 and declined during drought in 1993-94. These changes provided a significant contrast in densities and the opportunity to determine the life history stages where survival was density dependent and their causes. 2. There was a delay in age of maturity and a decline of both yearling and adult pregnancy rates at higher densities. Changes in yearling pregnancy had minimal effect on number of calves born. Adult pregnancy rate dropped from 95% to 88% 3. The greatest absolute mortality occurred in newborn calves (0-4 months old). The most variable survival was in dry-season calf mortality (5-11 months old). 4. Density dependence was clearly present in adult mortality and this appeared to be the regulating life stage. Density dependence was also found in dry-season calf mortality. The drop in pregnancy rate was only weakly density dependent. 5. The main cause of mortality (75% of cases) was undernutrition. Bone marrow condition showed that more animals died in extremely poor condition as the population increased and predators did not cause these deaths. 6. Predation played only a minor role in limiting the wildebeest population. Predators caught animals in moderate condition during the increase phase and increasingly healthy condition during years of high population density. The main predators were lion [Panthera leo (Linnaeus)] and hyaena (Crocuta crocuta Erxleben). 7. Adult mortality was significantly negatively related to food per capita. This could be viewed either as curvilinear density dependence, or as two phases of mortality. The first phase was during population increase when mortality was inversely density dependent and may have been caused by a constant predation rate. The second was during stability and decline and comprised the additive effects of undernutrition and predation. 8. Rainfall in the dry season was the most important extrinsic determinant of food supply for the wildebeest population but food was related to mortality only when population density was incorporated. 9. At present the wildebeest population appears regulated by natural causes through food supply. Human-caused mortality appears to be a minor factor. However, if the number of wildebeest killed by humans increases as human population increases, then there could be a permanent decline in wildebeest, and a major change in the whole ecosystem, because wildebeest are the keystone species.

1780,Alteration of fish diversity downstream from Petit-Saut Dam in French Guiana. Implication of ecological strategies of fish species,"Dams are expected to decrease fish diversity because they deeply alter downstream environment. However, such decline has not been consistently observed although profound modifications in the structure and/or composition of fish communities were generally recorded, and were linked to modifications of the downstream environment. In this work we analyze data from observations made before and almost 10 years after the completion of a hydroelectric dam in the neotropics. We monitored fish diversity below that dam and compared the taxonomic and functional structures of the samples between the pre- and post-dam periods. A significant decrease in species richness was evidenced. Taxonomic and trophic structures were significantly different between the two periods.

3696,Going the extra mile: Ground-based monitoring of olive ridley turtles reveals Gabon hosts the largest rookery in the Atlantic,"The management of widely dispersed marine vertebrates can be facilitated by better understanding their distribution, density, population trends and threats. Unfortunately, for some populations of sea turtle spatial and temporal data are often lacking, particularly along the Atlantic coast of Africa, a region which is considered globally important. Here we combined spatially limited monitoring data from four nesting beaches over seven seasons with an extensive ground-based coastal survey that covered 585 km of Gabons Atlantic coast, to provide the first population assessment for the olive ridley turtle Lepidochelys olivacea. This species is currently classified as data deficient by the IUCN in the eastern Atlantic and so is considered a regional conservation priority. Whilst the logistics required to undertake such a comprehensive ground-based census were complicated, the method proved extremely effective in providing population estimates for a widely dispersed marine vertebrate and demonstrates the importance of focusing beyond intensively monitored beaches. In particular, our findings reveal that the presence of nesting activity spans almost the entirety of Gabons coast, the density of which subsequently reveals that Gabon hosts one of the most important olive ridley rookeries in the Atlantic (23709814 clutches, approximating to 9485452 breeding females per annum and a total estimate of 14228178 breeding females), with a significant proportion, 81 ± 3.5% (mean ± 1 S.D.) of total nesting effort occurring within protected areas.

2635,Seasonal cycles and long-term trends in abundance and species composition of sharks associated with cage diving ecotourism activities in Hawaii,"Shark cage diving is both popular and controversial, with proponents citing educational value and non-extractive use of natural resources and opponents raising concerns about public safety and ecological impacts. Logbook data collected 2004-2008 from two Oahu (Hawaii) shark cage diving operations were analysed to determine whether such voluntary records provide useful insights into shark ecology or ecotourism impacts. Operators correctly identified common shark species and documented gross seasonal cycles and long-term trends in abundance of Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis), sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and tiger sharks (Galeorcerdo cuvier). Annual cycles in shark abundance may indicate seasonal migrations, whereas long-term trends suggest gradual exclusion of smaller sandbar sharks from cage diving sites. Numerically dominant (> 98%) Galapagos and sandbar sharks are rarely implicated in attacks on humans. Negligible impact on public safety is supported by other factors such as: (1) remoteness of the sites, (2) conditioning stimuli that are specific to the tour operations and different from inshore recreational stimuli and (3) no increase in shark attacks on the north coast of Oahu since cage diving started.

To evaluate the plan's effectiveness in conserving populations of the murrelet, a species associated with older, late-successional forests, we estimated the murrelet's density in near-shore marine waters of washington, Oregon, and northern California south to San francisco bay. we sampled annually, using line transects and distance estimation. we divided the study area of about 8800 km2 into fve geographic subareas corresponding to existing murrelet-conservation zones. Annual population estimates for the plan ranged from an estimated 23 700 (95% CI: 18 300 to 29 000) birds in 2002 to a low of 16 700 (95% CI: 13 100 to 20 300) in 2010, representing an average rate of decline of 3.7% annually (95% CI: -4.8 to -2.7%) from 2001 to 2010.

3419,Centurial and decadal oceanographic influences on changes in northern gannet populations and diets in the north-west Atlantic: implications for climate change,"Millennial and centurial changes in oceanography influence the distributions and movement patterns of fish and invertebrates. These changes, in turn, determine the availability of food resources for higher trophic levels and, hence, affect the distributions and abundances of marine birds. A century-long population trend of northern gannets (Sula bassana) is correlated with warming surface water conditions and increased mackerel (Scomber scombrus) availability. On a decadal scale, a major dietary change of breeding gannets from migratory warm-water pelagic fish and squids to cold-water fish is associated with cold-water perturbations in the north-west Atlantic during the 1990s. Cold-water influences appear to have inhibited migratory pelagic fish and squid from moving into the region in recent years, causing a major shift in pelagic food webs on the Newfoundland Shelf. Such findings imply that slight changes in oceanographic conditions, possibly associated with climate warming, could have large-scale and pervasive effects on seabird distributions, feeding ecology, reproductive success, and populations.

1393,Wolf depredation trends and the use of fladry barriers to protect livestock in western North America,"In Alberta, Canada (1982-2001), and in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, United States (1987-2001), wolves (Canis lupus) killed various domestic animals, among which the major prey were sheep in the United States (68%, n = 494) and cattle in Canada (95%; n = 1633). Under recovery programs, the wolf population increased in the United States, and depredation events increased proportionately. In both countries, the number of domestic animals killed each year was correlated with the number of wolves killed by government authorities for depredation management. We tested the ability of antiwolf barriers made of flags hanging from ropes to impede wolf access to food and livestock. In 18 experiments, barriers prevented captive wolves (n = 9) from accessing food for up to 28 hours and allowed daily separation of wolves to administer contraceptive pills to a female wolf. Barriers prevented access by wild wolves to 100-m2 baited sites during two 60-day tests. We also set barriers around three cattle pastures. In Alberta during two 60-day trials on 25-ha pastures, wolves approached barriers on 23 occasions but did not cross them, and no cattle were killed. Wolves killed cattle on neighboring ranches during the trials and before and after the trials on the tested ranches. In Idaho four radiocollared wolves crossed barriers and killed cattle in a 400-ha ranch after 61 days of barrier exposure. Our results suggest that antiwolf barriers are effective in deterring captive and wild wolves for > 1 and ≥ 60 days, respectively, and that wild wolves switch to alternative livestock when excluded from one herd of livestock.

2767,Monitoring population size of red deer Cervus elaphus: an evaluation of two types of census data from Norway,"Proper management of wildlife relies on metrics of population development. Typically, the best estimation techniques are too expensive for coarse-scale management. In marine fisheries, catch-per-unit effort is, commonly used, but problems may arise due to changes in spatial harvest effort or in habitat use as density changes. Managers in Norway are in the early phases of implementing 'seen deer' during harvesting and 'spring counts' on farmland as a means of monitoring red deer Cervus elaphus populations. We provide a first evaluation of how suitable these methods are by comparing the results with population estimates obtained using cohort analysis, and by analysing the within-season variation in number of seen deer. 'Seen deer' predicted annual increases in populations fairly well. Adjusting for harvesting effort provided less good estimates, due to a proportionally larger increase in effort relative to deer population size as population size increased. The number of seen deer per day decreased rapidly at the beginning of the season, and then levelled off or increased slightly during the rut, especially on farmland. The number of seen deer increased both with the number of harvesters and hours harvested, but at a diminishing rate. The current practice of 'spring counts' was not successful in predicting population changes, probably due to a lack of replication. Indeed, date strongly affected the number of deer seen during spring counts. While 'seen deer' seems to be a very promising tool for monitoring population size of red deer, there are some limitations to the practice as implemented for moose Alces alces in Scandinavia due to a more complex relationship with harvesting effort. Our study highlights that the large number of hours harvesters observe wildlife can provide a useful tool for population monitoring.

3609,Fluctuations in food supply drive recruitment variation in a marine fish,"Reproductive rates and survival of young in animal populations figure centrally in generating management and conservation strategies. Model systems suggest that food supply can drive these often highly variable properties, yet for many wild species, quantifying such effects and assessing their implications have been challenging. We used spatially explicit time series of a well-studied marine reef fish (black surfperch Embiotoca jacksoni) and its known prey resources to evaluate the extent to which fluctuations in food supply influenced production of young by adults and survival of young to subadulthood. Our analyses reveal: (i) variable food available to both adults and to their offspring directly produced an order of magnitude variation in the number of young-of-year (YOY) produced per adult and (ii) food available to YOY produced a similar magnitude of variation in their subsequent survival. We also show that such large natural variation in vital rates can significantly alter decision thresholds (biological reference points) important for precautionary management. These findings reveal how knowledge of food resources can improve understanding of population dynamics and reduce risk of overharvest by more accurately identifying periods of low recruitment.

2037,Competition for shifting resources in the southern Benguela upwelling: Seabirds versus purse-seine fisheries,"In the southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem off the west coast of South Africa, seabird populations are decreasing dramatically because of reduced availability of pelagic fish. We tested the hypothesis that the west coast fishing industry is competing for the remaining stocks of anchovy and sardine with the largest colony of Vulnerable Cape Gannets (Morus capensis) along the Atlantic coast. Using GPS-tracking of the birds, echo-sounding of pelagic fish, and vessel log books, we located overlap areas between bird foraging ranges, pelagic fish distribution, and fishing activities. We then compared fish catches by gannets and vessels within their joint foraging zones. In October 2007, purse-seine fishing grounds and gannet foraging areas overlapped by only 13%. However, for a 1-month period, the amount of fish removed from this area by purse-seine boats amounted to 41% of the food requirements of the 72,000 gannets breeding on Malgas Island (25% of the world population). The fishery's catch in this area is significant in terms of its potential impact on gannets, but comprises only 3.6% of total fishery catch. Based on this finding, the rapidly decreasing size of the gannet colony and the stated objectives of South Africa's Marine Living Resources Act of 1998, the case for considering and experimenting with at-sea 'no-take' areas for the purse-seine fishery is strong. Efforts to establish whether 'no-take' fishing zones increase food availability for top predators is an important next step in conservation of the southern Benguela Ecosystem.

2072,Effects of patch quality and network structure on patch occupancy dynamics of a yellow-bellied marmot metapopulation,"1. The presence/absence of a species at a particular site is the simplest form of data that can be collected during ecological field studies. We used 13 years (1990-2002) of survey data to parameterize a stochastic patch occupancy model for a metapopulation of the yellow-bellied marmot in Colorado, and investigated the significance of particular patches and the influence of site quality, network characteristics and regional stochasticity on the metapopulation persistence. 2. Persistence of the yellow-bellied marmot metapopulation was strongly dependent on the high quality colony sites, and persistence probability was highly sensitive to small changes in the quality of these sites. 3. A relatively small number of colony sites was ultimately responsible for the regional persistence. However, lower quality satellite sites also made a significant contribution to long-term metapopulation persistence, especially when regional stochasticity was high. 4. The northern network of the marmot metapopulation was more stable compared to the southern network, and the persistence of the southern network depended heavily on the northern network. 5. Although complex models of metapopulation dynamics may provide a more accurate description of metapopulation dynamics, such models are data-intensive.

1374,Viruses of the Serengeti: patterns of infection and mortality in African lions,"1. We present data on the temporal dynamics of six viruses that infect lions (Panthera leo) in the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania.

A seventh virus, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), was absent from these animals. 2. Comprehensive analysis reveals that feline herpesvirus and FIV were consistently prevalent at high levels, indicating that they were endemic in the host populations. Feline calici-, parvo- and coronavirus, and CDV repeatedly showed a pattern of seroprevalence that was indicative of discrete disease epidemics: a brief period of high exposure for each virus was followed by declining seroprevalence. 3. The timing of viral invasion suggests that different epidemic viruses are associated with different minimum threshold densities of susceptible hosts. Furthermore, the proportion of susceptibles that became infected during disease outbreaks was positively correlated with the number of susceptible hosts at the beginning of each outbreak. 4.

2770,Decomposing variation in population growth into contributions from environment and phenotypes in an age-structured population,"Evaluating the relative importance of ecological drivers responsible for natural population fluctuations in size is challenging. Longitudinal studies where most individuals are monitored from birth to death and where environmental conditions are known provide a valuable resource to characterize complex ecological interactions.We used a recently developed approach to decompose the observed fluctuation in population growth of the red deer population on the Isle of Rum into contributions from climate, density and their interaction and to quantify their relative importance. We also quantified the contribution of individual covariates, including phenotypic and life-history traits, to population growth. Fluctuations in composition in age and sex classes ((st)age structure) of the population contributed substantially to the population dynamics.

510,The influence of territory density on the vulnerability of arctic skuas Stercorarius parasiticus to predation.,"Foula (Shetland) holds one of the largest and densest Arctic skua Stercorarius parasiticus colonies in the UK and the largest colony of great skuas Catharacta skua in the world. The distribution of Arctic skua territories on Foula changed markedly between 1976 and 1994, with a disproportionately large decline occurring in most of the northern half of the island. Examination of breeding data collected in recent years (1992-1994) found no effect of Arctic skua breeding density on laying date, breeding synchrony, clutch volume or fledging success. However, hatching success and short-term post-fledging survival were considerably better in high-density areas where Arctic skuas seem able to mount a stronger defence against great skua predation. This was not without some associated costs, since a negative correlation existed between chick growth and the number of near neighbours in 2 out of 3 years. A simple model of local fluctuations in numbers during the early mid-1980s suggested that spatial variation in the mortality or emigration rate of established adults may have been responsible for the changes in distribution, probably as a result of pressure from great skuas. In addition, low density areas with poorer overall productivity seem to have attracted few new Arctic skua recruits. Similar density-dependent processes may have been responsible for long-term declines and changes in distribution of Arctic skuas at other colonies which have been attributed circumstantially to predation by great skuas. This study, therefore, provides key data on the influence of breeding density on vulnerability of Arctic skuas to predation. This is particularly relevant in the light of recent concern that the impact of great skua predation on other seabirds, including Arctic skuas, is unacceptably high in Shetland, and that some degree of population management should be considered.",28,Decline,Stable,Stable,Decline,Stable,Stable,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,-0.0197948933769755,-0.0247207348735821,-0.0148690518803689,,1.47496249750257e-06,1,Decline,Decline,The influence of territory density on the vulnerability of arctic skuas Stercorarius parasiticus to predation.,"The distribution of Arctic skua territories on Foula changed markedly between 1976 and 1994, with a disproportionately large decline occurring in most of the northern half of the island.

1729,"Earlier Nesting Contributes to Shorter Nesting Seasons for the Loggerhead Seaturtle, Caretta caretta","Evidence is mounting that warming air and sea temperatures are affecting nesting patterns in oviparous species by causing earlier nesting within seasons. The potential fitness consequences of nesting earlier include extended periods of offspring growth and larger clutch sizes. Additionally, the potential for nesting seasons to last longer exists, possibly allowing species that lay multiple clutches within a season to increase the number of clutches produced. To date, no studies have examined consequences of earlier nesting on duration of nesting season in oviparous vertebrates. We demonstrate that warmer sea surface temperatures are related to earlier nesting in the Loggerhead Seaturtle Caretta caretta, and that this response actually decreases, rather than increases, the length of the nesting season. In recent years (1995-2003), nesting became more evenly distributed throughout the season than in earlier years (1989-1994), and the nesting season decreased by approximately 43 days. Female turtles are unlikely to produce additional clutches within a reproductive season in response to this effect because of physiological constraints, and we cannot rule out the hypothesis that female turtles will lay fewer clutches because of a shortened nesting season, leading to reduced fecundity within seasons.

In the last two decades, even fishing gears that were traditionally considered highly selective, such as pelagic longlines, have been revealed to be responsible for the capture of many unwanted species. The pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) is not an endangered nor a charismatic species, but it largely dominates longlines bycatch fractions. The aim of our study was to investigate the importance of three main variables, bait size, presence and type of light attractors, and hook size and shape, in the capture rate of pelagic stingrays. Ninety-seven longline experimental sets were run. Trials took place on nine vessels in the Strait of Sicily, central Mediterranean Sea, over a period of 3 years from 2005 to 2007. Results showed that the larger the J hook, the lower the stingray capture rate. Moreover, 16/0 circle hooks had a significantly lower number of stingrays captured per 1000 hooks than J hooks, up to ∼80%. Bait size, within the range of sizes assessed, and use of light attractors did not have significant effects on stingray catch rate.

We used 4256 marten carcasses collected from trappers to examine changes in diet, productivity, age and sex structure of the harvest, and body and reproductive indices. Arvicoline rodents formed the greatest proportion (41-95% occurrence of total prey items) of the annual winter diet in both regions and snowshoe hares constituted 1-39% of prey items. Snowshoe hares constituted 3-64% of the diet when expressed as biomass. Dietary proportions of arvicolines increased and snowshoe hares decreased with time in the northern region but not in the southern region. Female marten took proportionately more arvicolines and males took more snowshoe hares. Juvenile marten took proportionately more snowshoe hares, while adults took more arvicolines. The proportion of juvenile marten in the harvest declined in both regions between 1991-1992 and 1993-1994. The ratio of juveniles to adult females in the harvest also declined with time in the southern region but not in the northern region. The amount of omental fat declined with time for most age and sex classes. Ovulation rates (as determined by counts of corpora lutea) declined with time among yearlings, and among adults from the southern region but not in the northern region.

1408,"The invasive red swamp crayfish as a predictor of Eurasian bittern density in the Camargue, France","Few data exist on the relationships between food levels and breeding density of the Eurasian bittern Botaurus stellaris, a vulnerable species of high-priority concern in Europe. Concurrent data were obtained on male bittern density and relative food abundance over a 3-year period in two wetlands totalling 2500 ha of Mediterranean reed marsh enclosing 25% of the French bittern population. Food abundance was estimated by sampling up to 25 hydrological units using a beach seine in early June of 2002, 2003 and 2004. The density of booming males in each hydrological unit was obtained by point counts and acoustic triangulation in May of the same years. The impact of food abundance on male bittern density was assessed by general regression models using a forward stepwise procedure with mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, carp Cyprinus carpio, other fish species, amphibians, red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii and other invertebrates as prey groups. Of these, only to crayfish abundance was bittern density related, contributing to 45% of the variance observed. When the impact of water level was taken into account, the relative abundance of crayfish explained 56% of the inter-annual differences in bittern density. Because crayfish are rich in calcium and well adapted to fluctuating hydroperiods alternating with drought intervals, they provide a good food source for the bitterns throughout the breeding season at the study sites. The loss of diversity and degradation reported from macrophyte-dominated marshes following crayfish invasion does not seem to apply to reed-dominated wetlands. It is further suggested that the recent increase in bittern numbers in the Camargue, while other French populations were decreasing, could in part be related to red swamp crayfish abundance.

2609,"Breeding dynamics of a Gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua population at Cierva Point, Antarctic Peninsula","Aspects of the breeding biology of the Gentoo Penguin Pygoscelis papua were studied at Cierva Point, Antarctic Peninsula (64°09'S, 60°57'W). From a breeding population of 1044 pairs (85% with two eggs), 83% raised at least one chick to fledging. Survival in different subcolonies was neither correlated with perimeter-area ratio nor with distance to the sea. Chick mortality at the end of January 1993 was 23.9%, whereas for the 1991/92 breeding season it was 14.0%; for 1993/94, 23.9%; for 1994/95, 33.0% and for 1995/96 24.3%. By 17 February 1993, chick mortality was 32.3%. Chick survival was regressed against time for nine selected subcolonies, showing a high correlation between them. Covariance analysis among the regression line slopes showed a non-significant result (F = 0.42, P > 0.05). No significant differences were also observed when Tuckey's multiple contrasts test was performed on the proportions of surviving chicks in-between weeks (P > 0.05), showing a gradual mortality of chicks from egg-laying to créching. These results show that the Gentoo Penguin colony at Cierva Point contains a higher proportion of pairs rearing two chicks and a lower mortality rate than does the species at other maritime Antarctic sites. Average annual growth of the colony increased by 5.7% from 1991 to 1996, in contrast to the period 1954-1958 when the colony decreased by -2.3%.

4605,Drought Facilitates Species Invasions in an Urban Stream: Results From a Long-Term Study of Tropical Island Fish Assemblage Structure,"The natural flow regime is a key regulator of the dynamics of stream communities and ecosystem processes. Native fish assemblages are evolutionarily adapted to their local flow regime. In the Caribbean, streams are vulnerable to changes in climate that will alter their flow regimes. We assessed long-term patterns in fish assemblages (2008-2016) in an urban stream in San Juan, Puerto Rico. We hypothesized that drought periods would result in negative effects on native fish species and positive effects on introduced species. Fish assemblages were sampled annually from 2008 to 2016 by backpack electrofishing, with additional sampling during 2015, which was a drought year. Cumulative dry season discharge was consistently over 300 m3/s from 2008 to 2013, except from 2014 to 2016 when it dropped below 170 m3/s. Thirteen species were found, including most native species reported for Puerto Rico and introduced species (e.g., Cichlids, Poeciliids, and Loracariids). Native species were dominant in abundance during most years, except during drought and post-drought sampling events when introduced species became dominant. Introduced species increased in richness with time from less than two species between 2008 and 2013 to seven in 2015. The increase in introduced species was mostly attributed to the appearance of several species of cichlids toward the end of the study. Cluster analysis divided the data set in two groups: drought and non-drought sampling events. Introduced cichlids and the native A. monticola accounted for more than 60% of assemblage dissimilarity. Fish assemblage abundance and richness were negatively related to several components of stream hydrology (e.g., cumulative daily stream discharge, the number of major floods). A significant change in size over time was found for the native A. monticola, which decreased in size during the drought period. Overall, our study documents drought-facilitated invasions by several aggressive and highly ecologically competitive species, highlights the importance of the natural flow regime as a source of environmental resilience to invasions in tropical island streams, and provides an example of how climate change has and will likely continue to alter Caribbean stream fish assemblages.",1551,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Varied,Varied,Stable,Stable,-0.104771213744143,-0.15129024524659102,-0.0582521822416957,0.0237346358756506,1.0134898285992699e-05,5,Decline,Decline,Drought Facilitates Species Invasions in an Urban Stream: Results From a Long-Term Study of Tropical Island Fish Assemblage Structure,"Native fish assemblages are evolutionarily adapted to their local flow regime.

3747,"Species-specific population trends detected for penguins, gulls and cormorants over 20 years in sub-Antarctic Fuegian Archipelago","Understanding the dynamics and causes of population trends are essential for seabird conservation. Long-term studies of seabirds at high-latitude (Antarctic, sub-Antarctic and Arctic) regions have shown contrasting species-specific trends in population size in response to climate change and anthropogenic pressures. We have studied for the last 20 years (1992-2012) the population trends of seven seabird species that breed in the Beagle Channel, south-eastern Tierra del Fuego and at Staten Island, a sub-Antarctic region in southern Argentina. The numbers of Magellanic and Gentoo Penguins increased significantly since 1992 (by >15 % year-1). In comparison, the populations of Imperial Cormorants, Dolphin Gulls and Kelp Gulls increased at slower rates (<5 % year-1), while the Rock Cormorant population even decreased by 1.3 % year-1. At Staten Island, the numbers of Rockhopper Penguins decreased by 24 % between the censuses of 1998 and 2010, whereas the population of Magellanic Penguins increased by 227 % during the same period. Over the study period, air and sea-surface temperatures remained stable in our study area, suggesting that the detected population changes are not driven by the climate. This finding contrasts with the detected links between increasing temperature trends and seabird population changes reported from Antarctic and Arctic regions. The level of tourism and size of the permanent human population has increased in the Beagle Channel area during the last 20 years and could be responsible for the increase of gull populations. The seabird species that received the highest number of visitors (Imperial Cormorants and penguin species) seem to be adapted or at least indifferent to pressures exerted by tourism, as their populations increased during the study period.

1400,"Biases in estimating population size from an aerial census: A case study in the Kruger National Park, South Africa.","In the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, aerial census data for approximately 15 herbivore species were collected from 1981 to 1993 using a total area count, strip transect method. No estimates of bias or precision error were obtained for the census data. Visibility bias, however, has been shown to be a primary source of error in aerial census data collected using methods similar to the KNP's. Starfield argues that a pragmatic modelling approach can be used to understand the importance of uncollected data and improve data collection strategies. Following this pragmatic approach, we develop a simple, deterministic model to estimate the potential range of bias in the KNP census data. Sources of visibility bias considered in our model include undercounting detected herds and failing to detect small herds. We apply the model to data collected for impala, zebra, wildebeest and waterbuck, because these species represent a range of potential censusing challenges. The model suggests that visibility bias represents a major source of error in the KNP census data.

2799,Population development of Harbour seals Phoca vitulina in the Wadden Sea after the 1988 virus epizootic,"The mortality as a result of the 1988 virus epizootic amongst harbour seals Phoca vitulina in the North and Baltic Seas is estimated at 60% in the entire Wadden Sea. In the years 1989-1994, a prosperous recovery of the population has been observed which is reflected in a high post-epizootic rate of increase. The average annual rate of increase for the entire area was 16%, highest in The Netherlands (average 21%) and lowest in Denmark (average 10%). This rate of increase is significantly higher than in the pre-epizootic period 1976-1987, when the population increased at a rate of around 9% per year. The difference is partly attributed to a considerably lower initial juvenile mortality after the epizootic. The present first-year mortality is statistically significantly lower than in the 1970s. It is about equal in all regions and estimated at approximately 40%, whereas it was approximately 65% in the 1970s. The post-epizootic reproductive rate in The Netherlands is significantly higher: 21% on average, against 13% before 1988; it is also higher in Niedersachsen (21 vs. 16%), but lower in Schleswig-Holstein (19 vs. 23%), while in Denmark it has not changed (both 17%). It is hypothesised that the improved reproductive rate in The Netherlands might be a result of selective mortality during the epidemic, which within the adult female segment would have predominantly affected those not reproducing. It is emphasised that though the population is recovering well, its size of almost 8800 animals in 1994 is still only one quarter of an estimated reference figure of 37000 seals around 1900.

1468,Effects of changes in sandeel availability on the reproductive output of seabirds.,"The lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus is a key prey species for many marine birds in the North Sea. This fish is currently the target of the largest single species fishery in the area, and this has led to concern about the potential impact of the fishery on seabirds. There are 2 critical issues: does the breeding success of seabirds depend on sandeel availability and does the fishery reduce sandeel availability to a level at which avian reproductive output is affected? This paper investigates the first question in detail and briefly touches on the second by testing for correlations between productivity, breeding effort and diet in 3 species of seabird with contrasting foraging and dietary characteristics (common guillemot Uria aalge, black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, and European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and an index of availability of 1 group and older sandeels derived from catch per unit effort statistics from the Danish sandeel fishery. Breeding success in all 3 species was significantly reduced when sandeel availability to the fishery in June was low. There was also evidence that the timing of peak sandeel availability influenced reproductive output such that success was lower when availability peaked early. We speculate that these effects are linked to annual variations in sandeel life history events and, in particular, to the onset of burying behaviour of 1+ group fish and the arrival of 0 group sandeels on the seabirds' feeding grounds. Although the timing of these events is unlikely to be directly influenced by the sandeel fishery, since most catches are taken in June, it is possible that the fishery could exacerbate a difficult situation for seabirds by further reducing the biomass of available 1+ group fish. We suggest that this may have occurred in one of the years of the study.",234,Varied,Varied,Varied,Varied,Stable,Stable,Varied,Varied,Varied,Varied,-0.0140537146700349,-0.0516880807422576,0.0235806514021879,0.0192015600128767,0.46422665306506106,3,Stable,Stable,Effects of changes in sandeel availability on the reproductive output of seabirds.,"This fish is currently the target of the largest single species fishery in the area, and this has led to concern about the potential impact of the fishery on seabirds.

4249,Dramatic declines in neotropical salamander populations are an important part of the global amphibian crisis,"We document major declines of many species of salamanders at several sites in Central America and Mexico, with emphasis on the San Marcos region of Guatemala, one of the best studied and most diverse salamander communities in the Neotropics.

4191,Aerial survey as a tool to estimate whale shark abundance trends,"Aerial surveys have been used to estimate population abundance of both terrestrial and marine species; in the marine environment this has largely been used for air-breathing species that spend time regularly at the surface. Whale sharks spend a large proportion of their time close to the surface and so are amenable to aerial survey techniques. This study presents the results of six years of synoptic aerial belt-surveys done nearly daily during the peak whale shark season around the island of Mahe, Seychelles. A total of 580 survey flights were flown providing 699.7 hours of survey record. A seasonal peak of shark sightings per hour was recorded in September or October in most years with the maximum on a single survey of 28.4 h- 1 in October 2006. The aerial survey data were used to generate an estimate of relative population abundance indicating that highest mean annual relative population estimate was also in 2006, with an estimate of 38, while the lowest mean estimate was 11 in 2004. These estimates were then compared to weekly capture-mark-recapture estimates of abundance based on unique individual identification data. The results indicate that the use of aerial survey data alone may give an acceptable indication of instantaneous relative population abundance but further refinement is necessary to estimate absolute regional abundance.

2722,Management strategies for the wolverine in Scandinavia,"The use of Population Viability Analysis has recently been criticized mainly because uncertainties in population predictions are often ignored. We analyzed the viability of Scandinavian wolverine Gulo gulo populations that allow for the inclusion of uncertainties in parameter estimates and stochastic effects on population dynamics. We used the insight gained from analyses of stochastic population models to quantitatively analyze different management options for the wolverine. These management options were based on data from an individual-based demographic study in the Sarek National Park, Sweden, and data from monitoring schemes in Norway and Sweden. Stochastic components in population dynamics of the wolverine were large. Strong density regulation occurred around the carrying capacity. According to the World Conservation Union (2001), the carrying capacity of populations must exceed 46 sexually mature (≥3-yr-old) females to be considered not vulnerable. Continuation of the current levels of offtake in Norway will lead to extinction of the wolverine over large parts of the country. Hence, current rates of mortality of female wolverine make the northern population endangered, whereas the southern population is classified as vulnerable. Management plans allowing harvest of individuals should be based on a proportional threshold harvest strategy. Only 40-60% of the surplus individuals exceeding a certain threshold for harvesting should be removed.

Eighty seven populations from all over Hokkaido were grouped into the following 4 types according to their flucturation patterns: type A: low density-constant type; type B: medium density-gradual increase type; type C: medium density-wavy change type; type D: high density-large amplitude type. The border between type B and type C was not clear. Although the distribution of the fluctuation types did not show any geographical cline, the high density type (type D) occurred in limited areas where the winter was severe and spring came later and almost all the populations in the Oshima peninsula were the low density type (type A). The most common type of population in Hokkaido, type C, greatly fluctuated from year to year with the maximum density level/the minimum one being over 10. The periodicity of the peak years was not statistically significant, although peaks often occurred at 3 or 4 year intervals. The population grew from spring to autumn in almost all years so that the pattern of the seasonal change was qualitatively constant. The population density levels in spring were not significantly different between peak years and others, while those in autumn were greatly different between them, so that the population growth rates from spring to autumn were variable from year to year.

3720,"Productivity of lesser snow geese on Banks Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, in 1995-1998","We estimated that 264 000452 000 Lesser Snow Geese Chen caerulescens caerulescens nested at Egg River on Banks Island, Northwest Territories, in 19951998. This was about twice as many geese as was reported nesting there in the 1980s, and we estimated that the nesting population grew by 4.2% per year from 1953 to 1998. The number of nesting geese varied considerably among years and was lower in years when nesting was delayed by late snowmelt (called late years hereafter). Late years were also characterized by large numbers of nonbreeding geese in the brood-rearing areas, suggesting that timing of snowmelt had a greater effect on the proportion of geese attempting to breed at Egg River each year than it had on the number of geese arriving at Banks Island. Clutch size and nesting success at Egg River ranged between 3.5 and 3.8 eggs and between 45% and 86%, respectively, in 19951998. Both clutch size and nesting success were lower in years when nesting was delayed by late snowmelt, which suggests that depletion of body reserves while waiting for snow to melt was a key factor affecting breeding performance at Egg River. Clutch size and nesting success at Egg River were comparable to those of Lesser Snow Geese at other colonies of similar latitude. Lesser Snow Geese at Egg River laid more eggs outside of nest bowls in late years. We estimated that about 14% of the nesting population died at Egg River from 1996 to 1998 (goose mortality was not monitored accurately in 1995). There appeared to be more geese dying in late years, which suggests that deaths were related to the nutritional status of geese. There were likely several causes of death, but avian cholera was confi rmed in about half of the dead geese examined in all years. Avian cholera was, thus, an important factor affecting Lesser Snow Geese nesting on Banks Island in all years. We estimated that 441 000644 000 adult Lesser Snow Geese were dispersed throughout Banks Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary No. 1 during the brood-rearing season in 19961998 (the area was not completely surveyed in 1995, so we were unable to estimate the total number of geese in that year). The highest densities of brood-rearing geese were found in the river valleys closest to Egg River, whereas failed and nonbreeding geese moved farther and were found in the highest density in the delta of Bernard River about 125 km north of Egg River. Even though densities were generally lower on the uplands between river valleys, the vast area of the uplands (80% of the study area) meant that most geese were associated with ponds, lakes, creeks, and small rivers on the uplands. Gosling survival ranged between 27% and 44% during the fi rst 23 weeks after hatch in 19961998 and was similar to, or perhaps somewhat lower than, gosling survival of Lesser Snow Geese at other colonies. Goose use had a strong negative impact on the availability of graminoid plants (i.e., grasses and sedges) in the brood-rearing areas of Banks Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary No. 1.

Many ecosystems are characterized by pulses of dramatically higher than normal levels of foods (pulsed resources) to which animals often respond by caching foods for future use. However, the extent to which animals use cached foods and how this varies in relation to fluctuations in other foods is poorly understood in most animals. 2. Arctic foxes Alopex lagopus (L.) cache thousands of eggs annually at large goose colonies where eggs are often superabundant during the nesting period by geese. We estimated the contribution of cached eggs to arctic fox diets in spring and autumn, when geese were not present in the study area, by comparing stable isotope ratios ([delta]13C and [delta]15N) of fox tissues with those of their foods using a multisource mixing model in Program IsoSource. 3. The contribution of cached eggs to arctic fox diets was inversely related to collared lemming Dicrostonyx groenlandicus (Traill) abundance; the contribution of cached eggs to overall fox diets increased from < 28% in years when collared lemmings were abundant to 30-74% in years when collared lemmings were scarce. 4.

3939,Surveying while fishing in the slope areas off Brazil: direct assessment of fish stock abundance from data recorded during commercial trawl fishing operations,"Estimating the total biomass of fish stocks available for fishing at any one time can highly improve the process of deciding upon sustainable fishing management measures. However, countries where fishing resources are not abundant or valuable can hardly justify a regular investment in costly direct stock assessment programs. One way of overcoming such difficulties is to use catch rate data recorded from monitored commercial fishing operations, usually made available through the implementation of less expensive Observers programs. However, this data is prone to overestimate biomass of targeted stocks, because fishermen tend to operate in high-density areas. This study addresses this issue by exploring the use of geostatistical models to estimate biomass of three slope fish stocks of the Brazilian EEZ: codling (Urophycis mystacea), hake (Merluccius hubbsi) and monkfish (Lophius gastrophysus). The analysis included 25,824 commercial trawls conducted off Brazil between 2000 and 2009. Global biomass tonnage estimations were: codling 16,402 ton in 2001 and 23,816 ton in 2002; hake 267,712 ton in 2001 and 233,107 ton in 2002; monkfish 51,947 ton in 2001 and 16,998 ton in 2002. Values exceeded those obtained by scientific surveys conducted in the same period and area, but an in-depth analysis of methods employed demonstrated that such overestimation was only significant in the case of hake, the main target of the trawl fleet during the study period. The study showed that geostatistical models are most effective in reducing bias introduced by fishermen behavior when some catches away from high density areas are available.

2063,Conservation of the swift parrot Lathamus discolor - management lessons for a threatened migratory species,"Conserving habitat for wide-ranging fauna species provides a challenge because impacts on these species tend to be dismissed based on the assumption that there is sufficient habitat in other areas of its range. This incremental loss of habitat is a serious conservation issue for a diversity of bird species. As knowledge of wide-ranging and migratory bird species increases, it often becomes evident that they select specific sites on a regular basis (i.e., the species exhibit site fidelity). Gaining a better understanding of site fidelity and selective habitat use for wide-ranging species is clearly important, but also extremely challenging. In this paper, challenges associated with conservation of the migratory and wide-ranging Swift Parrot Lathamus discolor are discussed as an example of how a recovery programme has aimed to address such conservation and management challenges. Despite the small population size (less than 2 500 birds), broad distribution (1 250 000 km2) and often cryptic nature, the implementation of the national recovery programme has been successful in the identification and protection of important habitats.

2418,When to end releases in reintroduction programmes: demographic rates and population viability analysis of bearded vultures in the Alps,"1. Reintroductions are commonly used for re-establishing self-sustainable populations in formerly inhabited areas. Reintroductions are expensive, and thus, it is worth performing a thorough demographic analysis of current and likely future population trajectories to guide strategic decisions on release policy. 2. Bearded vultures Gypaetus barbatus were exterminated from the Alps in the late 19th century, mainly due to human persecution. To re-establish them, captive-bred young have been released annually since 1986. Since the first successful breeding in the wild in 1997, the population has increased to 9 pairs in 2006. It is not known, however, for how long releases should be continued to obtain a self-sustaining, viable population. 3. We estimated age-specific survival probabilities with a mark-resighting model and quantified fecundity rates of released individuals. Using the resulting demographic estimates, we built a stochastic population model to estimate population growth rates, and explored the value of continuing to release birds for varying periods into the future. 4. Annual survival probabilities were high (first year of life, 0.88; later years, 0.96); average annual fecundity was 0.6 fledglings per breeding pair. Using the estimated survival probabilities, projected population growth rates would increase with additional years of releases. Yet, the population would grow, even if releases had stopped after 2006. Only if mortality increased by ≥ 50% would the population start to decline. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our population dynamics model provides essential information to optimize decision-making within a major reintroduction programme. From a demographic viewpoint, releases of captive-raised bearded vultures can be ceased in the Alps. The resources freed could be redirected towards a close demographic surveillance of the free-ranging population, with periodic evaluation of its viability and the option to release birds if deemed necessary. Birds available from the captive stock could be used for reintroductions in other areas where the bearded vulture is extinct.

1887,The effect of 'mosaic management' on the demography of black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa on farmland,"1. Like many farmland birds, the largest European population of the black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa, in The Netherlands, has been declining for decades despite conservation measures including agri-environment schemes (AES). In a new experimental AES aiming to reverse this decline, collectives of farmers implemented spatially coordinated site-level habitat management ('mosaic management') including delayed and staggered mowing of fields, refuge strips and active nest protection.2. We evaluated the effectiveness of mosaic management by measuring godwit breeding success in six experimental sites and paired controls. Productivity was higher in mosaics than in controls due to fewer agricultural nest losses. Chick fledging success was poor in both treatments. Productivity compensated for adult mortality in only one AES site.3. Although creating chick habitat was a major management goal, the availability of tall grass during the fledging period did not differ between treatments, mainly because rainfall delayed mowing in all sites and study years. However, chick survival increased with the availability of tall grass among sites. Higher chick survival will thus enhance the positive effect of mosaic management in drier years, but sensitivity to weather represents a weakness of the AES design.4. Available estimates of productivity in Dutch godwits suggest a strong reduction over the past 20 years and implicate chick survival as the main driver of their decline. Earlier mowing of grassland is the main causal mechanism, but changes in vegetation structure and composition, and increased predation may also have contributed.5. Synthesis and applications. Demographic rates like breeding success are useful parameters for evaluating effects of management. Mosaic management increases the productivity of black-tailed godwits, but does not ensure long-term population viability for this flagship species of wet grassland bird communities. More stringent management prescriptions need to improve both the area and the quality (vegetation structure) of grassland mown late.

2462,"Wolf Canis lupus numbers, diet and damage to livestock in relation to hunting and ungulate abundance in northeastern Belarus during 1990-2000","Wolf Canis lupus relationships with wild ungulates, domestic animals and humans were studied in an area of ca 800 km2 at the head of the Lovat River in northeastern Belarus during 1990-2000. The region was dominated by natural habitats (78%) consisting mainly of forests and bogs, but also lakes and rivers. The abundance of wild ungulates, such as moose Alces alces, wild boar Sus scrofa, and roe deer Capreolus capreolus, as censused by snow tracking and assessed by game wardens, declined 5 to 6-fold between 1990 and 1996, most probably due to uncontrolled exploitation and poaching. During 1997-2000, the numbers of ungulates began to recover. Wolves responded to the shortage of wild ungulates by a strong shift in feeding habits. When wild ungulates were numerous, wolf diet as studied by scat analysis was composed of wild ungulates (80-88% of consumed biomass), with small additions of medium- and small-sized wild animals (7-13%), mainly beaver Castor fiber and hare Lepus sp., and domestic animals (4-6%), mainly cattle. In the years when the recorded numbers of wild ungulates were at their lowest, wolves preyed on domestic animals (38% of biomass consumed), wild ungulates (32%), and medium- and small-sized wild prey (29%). Wolf damage to domestic animals (28 head of cattle and 247 dogs killed) and wolf-human interaction (100 observations of wolves in and near villages, including one attack by a rabid wolf on 11 people) were recorded in 14 villages. The rate of wolf predation on domestic animals and their appearances in villages increased exponentially with the declining biomass of wild ungulates and ceased again when wild ungulates began to recover; a one-year time lag in wolf response to changes in ungulate abundance was observed. The numbers of wolves as estimated by snow tracking and assessed by game wardens played a weaker role in shaping wolf-livestock and wolf-human interaction. The wolf population was strongly affected by hunting during the study. Wolves responded numerically with a 1 to 2-year time lag to the varying intensity of harvest by humans. Our study showed the role of the human factor in shaping wolf numbers and wolf-livestock interaction in eastern Europe. The three major components of this relationship were: 1) the manifold decline in wild ungulate abundance, which was most probably caused by uncontrolled exploitation by humans in the years of political transformation and economic regress, made wolves shift to predation on domestic animals; inevitably, wolves were frequently seen in the rural areas; 2) people interpreted the growing rates of wolf damage and appearances near the settlements as an effect of greatly increasing numbers of wolves, and demanded that authorities and hunters fight the 'wolf plague'; 3) hunting impact on wolves increased and led to a marked reduction in wolf numbers and a decline in wolf-human conflicts. This scenario was most probably repeated in many areas of eastern Europe during 1990-2000, which was a decade of political and economical transformation.

2384,"A decade of harbour porpoise occurrence in German waters--Analyses of aerial surveys, incidental sightings and strandings","Data on the occurrence of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in German waters from 1988 to 2002 were collected from dedicated aerial surveys, incidental sightings and strandings. Aerial surveys conducted in 1995 and 1996 revealed a mean abundance of 4288 (in 1995) and 7356 harbour porpoises (in 1996) in the German North Sea study area. Mean abundances of harbour porpoises in the German Baltic Sea, divided into two subunits (blocks B and C), were estimated at 980 and 1830 (in 1995 and 1996 resp.) and at 601 (in 1995; there were no sightings in block C during the 1996 survey). From 1988 to 2002, 791 incidental sightings of harbour porpoise pods were reported in German and partly Danish coastal waters of the North and Baltic Seas. In the period 1990 to 2001, 996 harbour porpoises were found stranded along the German North Sea coast and 17 animals were identified as by-catch. In the same period 229 harbour porpoises were found stranded along the German Baltic Sea coast and 105 animals were incidentally taken in fisheries. The proportion of by-caught harbour porpoises was significantly larger in the Baltic Sea. Different monitoring methods are helpful for different aims and management issues: aerial surveys cover large areas in a short time and provide information on density, abundance, distributional patterns and seasonality. Incidental sighting and stranding networks provide indications of general distribution, seasonal variation in abundance, age distribution, by-catch and of areas which are important in the harbour porpoise's life cycle. Comparison of data from the North and Baltic Seas revealed a higher abundance of harbour porpoises in the North Sea than in the Baltic Sea. Altogether the data sets demonstrated a strong seasonality of harbour porpoise occurrence off the German coast with highest numbers during the summer months. Important habitats for harbour porpoises were detected west of the islands of Sylt and Amrum in the North Sea and around the Schlei estuary, in waters west of Fehmarn and the Fischland-Darss area in the Baltic Sea.

The present survey was the fourth since 1989 on the same populations. We divided the habitats into intensive cultivation (IC), wet cultivation (WC), and scrub forests (SC). The number of groups has significantly reduced from 54 to 31 and the number of animals has declined from 1,207 to 697 from 1989 to 2009. This decline has been recorded only in the IC and WC areas, whereas the population in SC with places of Hindu worship has remained stable. Due to the loss of roadside Ficus trees over the years, the habitat of the monkeys has almost disappeared. Since bonnet macaque is not primarily a forest-dwelling species, the seemingly widespread primate may soon become 'threatened' if the non-forest populations continue to decline.

2771,"Changes in numbers and distribution of the northern gannet (Morus bassanus) on Rouzic Island, (Reserve Naturelle des Sept-Iles, Bretagne), France 1939-1994","This paper describes changes in numbers and distribution of Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus) on Rouzic Island from the colony's formation in 1939 to 1994. Rouzic is the only French gannetry and is currently the most southerly breeding location for the species. Population size and distribution were assessed by using land-based field counts, photographs taken from the sea and aerial photographs. Since its foundation, the colony has shown three periods of increase with average annual rates of increase of 28.1% (1947-65), 5.0% (1967-79) and 8.4% (198194). A Leslie simulation model indicates that, at least during the first and third periods, these increases were likely to have been sustained by net immigration of Northern Gannets to Rouzic. Compared to other gannetries of a similar age and size, Rouzic currently shows a high rate of population increase. In 1994, the colony held about 11,500 pairs and about 2,000 non breeders. At present, colony size is not limited by the availability of nesting habitat, but Northern Gannets will soon colonize the area occupied by the few Atlantic Puffins (Fratercula arctica) and Manx Shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus) still breeding on Rouzic. While this may cause the extinction of the Atlantic Puffin colony, there is no evidence that Northern Gannets have been responsible for the long term decline in Atlantic Puffin numbers.",728,Increase,Increase,Stable,Increase,Increase,Stable,Increase,Increase,Increase,Increase,0.0379395066299414,0.0291276298543277,0.0467513834055551,,5.075301927647849e-10,1,Increase,Increase,"Changes in numbers and distribution of the northern gannet (Morus bassanus) on Rouzic Island, (Reserve Naturelle des Sept-Iles, Bretagne), France 1939-1994","Rouzic is the only French gannetry and is currently the most southerly breeding location for the species.

1265,A model of ruddy duck Oxyura jamaicensis eradication for the UK,"1. Non-native species are the second most important threat to global biodiversity after habitat loss. The North American ruddy duck Oxyura jamaicensis established a feral population in the UK more than 40 years ago, and it is now threatening the endangered white-headed duck Oxyura leucocephala through hybridization. We utilized a simple generic model, which includes uncertainty in parameter estimates and can be used for any invasive species, to assess the time frame for successful control. 2. A simple spreadsheet-based model was produced to provide the UK government with an assessment of whether sufficient ruddy ducks could be culled to allow the UK population to be reduced to fewer than 175 individuals (> 97% population reduction) within 10 years. 3. Data on changes in numbers of ruddy duck at the main UK wintering sites were collected during a regional control trial, and a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation model was constructed to project the UK population under a variety of control strategies. Three variables were included in the model: cull rate per person (i.e. by how much each control officer could reduce the national population per year), number of control officers, and changes in the ruddy duck population growth rate as the population was reduced. 4. Parameter estimation was kept to a minimum by using historical annual population growth rates as a basis for future growth rates. The historical data show a reduction in both the mean growth rate and in its variability when the population is in excess of 2000 birds. Density-dependent and density-independent models were produced. These all gave similar times to reach the target population, with some difference in the variance estimates between models. 5. Simulations were run with a maximum annual population reduction of between 0.50 and 0.80, and between 12 and 20 control officers. A total of 8000 simulations was performed for each of the 63 different scenarios for each of the models. 6. The mean time to reduce the UK ruddy duck population by 97% was predicted to be between 3 and 5 years, with 14 or 15 control officers reducing the population by between 65% and 70% per year. There was an 80% certainty that the population could be reduced to this level by 16 control officers within 4-6 years if annual reductions of more than 60% were achieved. 7. Synthesis and applications. The novel spreadsheet model presented here can easily be applied to a range of eradication schemes where limited data are available on population size and culling efficacy. This would allow funding bodies to have a greater degree of certainty about the cost and outcome of a trial eradication programme.

3819,Estimating the density of a jaguar population in the Brazilian Pantanal using camera-traps and capture–recapture sampling in combination with GPS radio-telemetry,"The jaguar (Panthera onca) is the largest feline in the Americas and third largest world-wide, smaller in size only to the tiger (P. tigris) and lion (P. leo). Yet, in comparison, relatively few studies on jaguar population densities have been conducted and baseline data for management purposes are needed. Camera trapping and capturerecapture sampling methods were used to estimate the size of a jaguar population in the Pantanals open wet grassland habitat, an important area for the long-term survival of the species. This study is the first jaguar population estimate conducted in co-operation with a GPS-telemetry study providing an important opportunity for comparing different methods of density estimation. An accessible area within a 460 km2 privately-owned ranch was sampled with equal effort during the dry seasons of 2003 and 2004. Thirty-one and twenty-five individual jaguars were identified in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Estimates of jaguar abundance were generated by program CAPTURE. Density estimates were produced according to different methods used to calculate the effectively sampled areas which ranged from 274 to 568 km2. For 2003, the currently-used mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) method produced a density of 10.3 jaguars/100 km2, while GPS-telemetry-based calculations produced a mean density of 6.6 jaguars/100 km2. For 2004, the MMDM method produced an estimate of 11.7 jaguars/100 km2 while GPS-telemetry calculations produced a density of 6.7 jaguars/100 km2. Our results suggest that the widely-used MMDM method used to calculate effectively sampled areas is significantly under-reflecting maximum distances moved by jaguars and their range-use and, thereby, considerably inflating cat density estimates. This overestimation could place a population in a difficult situation by lengthening the time taken to initiate protection measures because of underestimating the risk to that population.",1180,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,-0.0630517457470779,,,,,1,Stable,Stable,Estimating the density of a jaguar population in the Brazilian Pantanal using camera-traps and capture–recapture sampling in combination with GPS radio-telemetry,"Yet, in comparison, relatively few studies on jaguar population densities have been conducted and baseline data for management purposes are needed.

2349,Dynamics of Finnish starling Sturnus vulgaris populations in recent decades,"The population size started to decrease in the late 1960s, and fell to c20% by the early 1980s. In the timing of the decrease, there were clear regional and local differences. Clutch size varied significantly among local populations (range of the means of annual means in three populations: 4.7-5.3 eggs), but there were much greater differences in the number of fledglings (range in the same populations: 2.33-3.99 fledglings, with 3.52-4.87 for four other populations). These differences were caused by differences in foraging habitat. According to national ringing data, brood size at the age of ringing increased significantly (by 0.04 nestlings/year) during 1968-89. The mean brood size decreased towards the north, probably due to large-scale abandoning of dairy farming in S Finland. This has resulted in losses of good foraging habitats (pastures and leys) for the starlings, and, as consequence, to reduced reproductive success in the whole south Finnish population. -from Authors",555,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,-0.0603741311431389,-0.0716422666630419,-0.0491059956232358,0.00574915437670523,8.511445060761729e-26,10,Decline,Decline,Dynamics of Finnish starling Sturnus vulgaris populations in recent decades,"In the timing of the decrease, there were clear regional and local differences.

1378,Arabian oryx reintroduction in Oman: successes and setbacks,"The return of the Arabian oryx Oryx leucoryx to Oman symbolized the success of a new approach to species conservation and established reintroduction as a conservation tool. Ten years after the species had been exterminated in the wild by poaching, the first 10 founder oryx, descendants of the 'World Herd', were reintroduced to the desert in central Oman in January 1982. A second release followed in 1984 and the population grew slowly through a 3-year drought that was broken by rain in June 1986. Further years of good rainfall and more founders meant that by April 1990 there were over 100 oryx in the wild, independent of supplementary feed and water, and using a range of over 11,000 sq km. At that time a new monitoring programme was implemented that allowed the transition from individual- to population-based monitoring and management. The population continued to grow and by October 1995 numbered approximately 280 in the wild (of which 22 were surviving founders) and used over 16,000 sq km of the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary. However, in February 1996 poaching resumed and oryx were captured for sale as live animals outside the country. Despite the poaching the population continued to increase and by October 1996 was estimated to be just over 400. However, poaching intensified and continued through late 1996 and 1997.

1517,North Atlantic humpback whale abundance and rate of increase four decades after protection from whaling.,"Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae in the North Atlantic Ocean were severely depleted by exploitation. With legal protection since 1955, substantial recovery is likely to have occurred, but information on abundance and rates of increase has been limited. We present an assessment of humpback whale abundance in the North Atlantic Ocean based upon capture-recapture estimates using naturally marked individuals. These data result from a long-term collaborative effort combining large-scale dedicated projects and incidental data collection, leading to extensive geographical coverage. The application of robust statistical techniques produces estimates of greater accuracy and precision than has previously been possible. Abundance estimates ranging from 5930 to 12 580 individuals, with coefficients of variation (CVs) from 0.07 to 0.39, were calculated for the West Indies breeding population using data from 1979 to 1993. The most precise estimate for the West Indies breeding population is 10 752 (CV = 0.068) for 1992 and 1993. Due to application of new analytical methods, these estimates are larger and more precise than those previously published from similar time periods. The average rate of increase for the West Indies breeding population over a 14 yr period was estimated to be 0.031 (SE = 0.005). The best available estimate for the entire North Atlantic population of humpback whales is 11 570 (95 % CI 10 290 to 13 390) based upon samples from 1992 and 1993.

536,"History, migration and present status of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae at Bermuda","Historical accounts show that humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae have frequented Bermuda waters, which are located half-way between wintering and summering grounds in the western North Atlantic, since the early 17th century. There were more humpbacks present in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries than there are today. It also appears that humpback whales utilised the Bermuda area from February to May during these centuries, while today they occur at Bermuda for only three to four weeks in April. Humpbacks probably used Bermuda as a breeding ground in winter during these previous centuries and it may be an area that will be repopulated during winter if and when the population recovers from over-hunting. Using the distinctive pattern of pigmentation on the under-sides of the tail flukes, 104 individual humpback whales were identified at Bermuda and 44 of these have also been seen at other locations, including all the major summering and wintering grounds in the western North Atlantic. Chi-square analysis of these resighting shows that the whales occur at Bermuda in the expected proportions, relative to the samples, from the summering and wintering grounds. Contemporary utilisation of Bermuda by humpbacks is as a mid-ocean habitat through which all members of the western North Atlantic population migrate during spring. There is also evidence suggesting that humpback whales feed at Bermuda on deep water scattering layers during their stop-over.

We used spatial modeling to investigate major drivers of great ape distribution and population trends. We predicted density across each taxons geographic range, allowing us to estimate overall abundance: 361,900 gorillas and 128,700 chimpanzees in Western Equatorial Africasubstantially higher than previous estimates. These two subspecies represent close to 99% of all gorillas and one-third of all chimpanzees. Annual population decline of gorillas was estimated at 2.7%, maintaining them as Critically Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List. We quantified the threats to each taxon, of which the three greatest were poaching, disease, and habitat degradation. Gorillas and chimpanzees are found at higher densities where forest is intact, wildlife laws are enforced, human influence is low, and disease impacts have been low. Strategic use of the results of these analyses could conserve the majority of gorillas and chimpanzees. With around 80% of both subspecies occurring outside protected areas, their conservation requires reinforcement of anti-poaching efforts both inside and outside protected areas (particularly where habitat quality is high and human impact is low), diligent disease control measures (including training, advocacy, and research into Ebola virus disease), and the preservation of high-quality habitat through integrated land-use planning and implementation of best practices by the extractive and agricultural industries.",1303,Decline,Stable,Stable,Decline,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,-0.0158784181015852,-0.373717246845017,0.341960410641846,0.182574185835055,0.9306956144335731,6,Stable,Stable,"Guns, germs, and trees determine density and distribution of gorillas and chimpanzees in Western Equatorial Africa","We used spatial modeling to investigate major drivers of great ape distribution and population trends.

3310,Stand structure and the abundance and diversity of plants and small mammals in natural and intensively managed forests,"Little attention has been given to investigating biodiversity in managed forests. Pre-commercial thinning (PCT) and fertilization have been used successfully to increase growth of coniferous trees, vegetative succession, and overall stand structure in second-growth stands. This study was designed to test the hypotheses (H) that PCT and repeated fertilization of young (20-25 years) even-aged lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands would enhance (H1) coniferous stand structure; (H2) abundance and diversity of understory vegetation; and (H3) abundance and diversity of forest-floor small mammals, to levels found in mature and old-growth forests. Replicate study areas were located near Summerland and Kelowna in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had six stands: young plantation, thinned stand (1000 stems/ha), thinned-fertilized stand (1000 stems/ha), unthinned stand, mature forest, and old-growth forest. Coniferous stand structure, understory vegetation, and forest-floor small mammals were sampled during a 5-year period from 1999 through 2003. The smaller tree sizes (diameter, height, basal area) in the young lodgepole pine stands did not support the tree size part of H1. Similar abundance of overstory and total conifers did support the abundance part of H1. The diversity component was supported by the similarity in species and structural diversity of total conifers among the intensively managed and older unmanaged stands. Response of understory vegetation was dominated by the abundance of herbs in the thinned-fertilized stands. There was no difference in shrub abundance among stands, but mosses and terrestrial lichens were most numerous in the mature and old-growth stands. Our results supported the abundance part of H2, at least for herbs and shrubs. Species richness and diversity of vascular plants were similar in managed and old-growth forests, and richness was lowest in the mature stands. H3 was supported for total abundance, species richness, and diversity of small mammals, and for the generalist species Peromyscus maniculatus and Tamias amoenus, but not for the old forest specialist Myodes gapperi. Two insectivores, Sorex monticolus and Sorex cinereus, were at comparable or higher abundance in the managed stands than in the older unmanaged forests. Three other microtines: Microtus pennsylvanicus, Microtus longicaudus, and Phenacomys intermedius were early successional vegetation specialists, and hence did not fit the prediction of H3. Thus, despite overall quantitative differences in stand structure and species-specific variability between our intensively managed and older natural stands, old-growth attributes seem to be developing in a time-span of decades rather than the centuries depicted by long rotations.

3262,Long-term responses in population dynamics and diversity of small mammals in riparian and upland habitats within an agricultural landscape,"Riparian zones in agricultural landscapes provide linear non-crop habitats for a variety of plant and mammal species, and hence are an important component of biodiversity. To date, variable responses of abundance, species richness, and species diversity of small mammals have been recorded in riparian and upland habitats. To address this variability, we provide a detailed analysis of seasonal changes in abundance and diversity of terrestrial small-mammal communities over a 7-year period within an agricultural landscape in south-central British Columbia, Canada. We tested the hypotheses (H) that abundance, species richness, and species diversity of communities of small mammals (H1), and demographic parameters of reproduction, recruitment, and survival of the major species: deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and montane vole (Microtus montanus) (H2), would be higher in riparian than upland habitats. Mean total abundance of small mammals was higher in summer and winter, and species richness higher in summer, in riparian than hedgerow habitats. Winter population data supported the total and species abundance patterns for small mammals, but species richness was similar, and diversity lower, in riparian than hedgerow sites during winter periods. Deer mice were the dominant species in terms of abundance and reproductive output for pregnancies and recruitment, but not survival, in riparian sites. Montane voles were similar in abundance and demographic parameters in the two habitats. House mice (Mus musculus) preferred hedgerows and wandering shrews (Sorex vagrans) riparian sites. Demographic parameters for deer mice and montane voles indicated that both riparian and hedgerow sites were ""source"" rather than ""sink"" habitats, and likely contribute to maintenance of mammal diversity in agricultural landscapes.

3386,Response of Red squirrels and feeding damage to variable stand density in young lodgepole pine forest,"This study was designed to test the hypothesis that large-scale habitat alteration by stand thinning would reduce red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) populations and feeding damage in young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest. An additional objective included integration of stand protection with an optimum thinning regime for growth rates of crop trees. Study areas were located neat Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of ≈ 500 (low), 1000 (medium), and 2000 (high) stems/ha, with an unthinned, juvenile pine stand and old-growth pine stand for comparison. Squirrel populations were sampled intensively in the thinned stands from 1989 to 1991; feeding damage was assessed annually from 1989 to 1993. Five-year diameter and height increments of crop trees were measured in the thinned stands at Penticton and Prince George, and 4-yr increments in these stands at Kamloops. Red squirrel populations were significantly reduced in the low-density stand compared with either the medium- or high-density stands at Penticton and Prince George, Squirrels were less abundant in both the low- and medium-density stands at Kamloops. Squirrel populations in the unthinned and old-growth stands were similar or lower in abundance than those in the thinned stands. There were significantly higher numbers of red squirrel first captures in the medium- and high-density stands than in the low-density stand. There were no consistent significant differences between stands in proportion of squirrels breeding, recruitment, mean survival over summer and winter period, or mean body mass. More trees per hectare were damaged in the high than in either low- or medium-density stands at all study areas. Mean diameter increments of trees in the low-density stands were significantly higher than those in the medium- and high-density stands at all study areas. Trees grew significantly faster in height in the high- than in the low-density stands at Penticton and Prince George; the converse was true at Kamloops.

2976,"Long-term decline of the western Pacific leatherback, Dermochelys coriacea: a globally important sea turtle population.","The leatherbacks nesting at Bird's Head Peninsula, Papua Barat, Indonesia, account for 75% of the total leatherback nesting in the western Pacific and represent the last sizeable nesting population in the entire Pacific. Sporadic nest counts at Jamursba Medi Beach at Bird's Head have indicated a declining trend from the 1980s through 2004, although a relatively high amount of nesting has recently been documented at Wermon Beach, located 30 km east of Jamursba Medi. We used expanded year-round nesting surveys from 2005 to 2011 at these two primary nesting beaches to obtain more robust estimates of the nesting population size and to evaluate long-term nesting trends. We found a 29% decline in nesting at Jamursba Medi and a 52% decline at Wermon from 2005 through 2011. We found that the estimated annual number of nests at Jamursba Medi has declined 78.3% over the past 27 years (5.5% annual rate of decline) from 14,522 in 1984 to 1,596 in 2011.

Observed clutch frequencies ranged from 3-10 per season with a mean of 5.5 ± 1.6 and, based on nest counts, provide an estimate of approximately 489 females nesting in 2011. The persistent and long term decline we report for the Bird's Head leatherback population follows other dramatic declines and extinctions of leatherback populations throughout the Pacific over the last 30 years.

4173,"Species diversity, relative abundance and length structure of oceanic sharks caught by the Venezuelan longline fishery in the Caribbean Sea and western-central Atlantic","This study examines the species diversity, relative abundance, and length structure of oceanic sharks caught by the Venezuelan longline fishery targeting swordfish and tuna. Shark catch data was collected by scientific observers during the period 1994 to 2003. The total shark catch was comprised of 25 species, in which the most frequently caught were Prionace glauca (34.8%) and Carcharhinus signatus (20.2%). Other common species in the catch composition were C. falciformis (8.5%), Sphyrna mokarran (6.8%), and Isuru oxyrinchus (6.2%). The inter-annual variation of the Shannon-Wiener index was characterized by an apparent loss of the shark diversity throughout the time series. Kriging map showed that areas with relative high diversity values were located in the southeastern Caribbean Sea, primarily in areas close to the islands and coast of Venezuela. Other areas with significant diversity values corresponded to the inner arc of the Lesser Antilles and the Suriname shelf. The analysis of catch per unit effort trends for the five most common species revealed that all series had a negative slopes, but only one (C. falciformis) was statistically significant. Shark catches for the most important species comprised a large proportion of juveniles. Major efforts will be needed to generate steady scientific information required for stock assessment.

1570,Cloud Forest Bird Responses to Unusually Severe Storm Damage,"In 1998, storms related to Hurricane Iris caused extensive gaps in the cloud forest of El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico, where severe storms are infrequent. We examined how this disturbance aflected bird species composition. Species richness and composition were similar both between pre- and post-disturbance forest and between newly created gaps and plots thar remained forested after the hurricane. However, differences in response guilds were greater between pre- and post-disturbance plots than between forest plots with gaps arter disturbance. Granivorous, omnivorous, and terrestrial species were more abundant before the hurricane, whereas insectivorous, midstory, and generalist foragers were more abundant after the hurricane. In addition, species with high sensitivity to disturbance were more abundant in the pre-disturbance forest, while low sensitivity species were more abundant after disturbance. In the post-disturbance forest, insectivorous species were most abundant in gaps and terrestrial-canopy foragers were most abundant in forest plots. Permanently open areas had significantly lower species richness, but had lowland generalist and second-growth species not present in the cloud forest. Results suggest that changes in species composition were not limited to the newly created gaps, but also affected the whole forest. The decline of high sensitivity species after disturbance supports the hypothesis that disturbance negatively affects specialists and benefits generalist species.

2726,Comparative Influence of Ocean Conditions on Yellowfin and Atlantic Bluefin Tuna Catch from Longlines in the Gulf of Mexico,"<p>Directed fishing effort for Atlantic bluefin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), their primary spawning grounds in the western Atlantic, has been prohibited since the 1980s due to a precipitous decline of the spawning stock biomass. However, pelagic longlines targeted at other species, primarily yellowfin tuna and swordfish, continue to catch Atlantic bluefin tuna in the GOM as bycatch. Spatial and temporal management measures minimizing bluefin tuna bycatch in the GOM will likely become important in rebuilding the western Atlantic bluefin stock. In order to help inform management policy and understand the relative distribution of target and bycatch species in the GOM, we compared the spatiotemporal variability and environmental influences on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of yellowfin (target) and bluefin tuna (bycatch). Catch and effort data from pelagic longline fisheries observers (1993â2005) and scientific tagging cruises (1998â2002) were coupled with environmental and biological data. Negative binomial models were used to fit the data for both species and Akaike's Information Criterion (corrected for small sample size) was used to determine the best model. Our results indicate that bluefin CPUE had higher spatiotemporal variability as compared to yellowfin CPUE. Bluefin CPUE increased substantially during the breeding months (March-June) and peaked in April and May, while yellowfin CPUE remained relatively high throughout the year. In addition, bluefin CPUE was significantly higher in areas with negative sea surface height anomalies and cooler sea surface temperatures, which are characteristic of mesoscale cyclonic eddies. In contrast, yellowfin CPUE was less sensitive to environmental variability. These differences in seasonal variability and sensitivity to environmental influences suggest that bluefin tuna bycatch in the GOM can be reduced substantially by managing the spatial and temporal distribution of the pelagic longline effort without substantially impacting yellowfin tuna catches.</p>",711,Decline,Decline,Stable,Decline,Decline,Stable,Decline,Decline,Decline,Decline,-0.027709069436527,-0.0479174912204543,-0.0075006476525998,,0.0116992700521307,1,Decline,Decline,Comparative Influence of Ocean Conditions on Yellowfin and Atlantic Bluefin Tuna Catch from Longlines in the Gulf of Mexico,"However, pelagic longlines targeted at other species, primarily yellowfin tuna and swordfish, continue to catch Atlantic bluefin tuna in the GOM as bycatch.

1370,Raptor predation and population limitation in red grouse,"1. We assessed the impact of predation by hen harriers and peregrine falcons on a red grouse population in southern Scotland during 1992-98. Grouse density in April, July and October declined during this time, coincident with an increase in the numbers of breeding harriers and peregrines. 2. Winter losses of grouse between October and April averaged 33% and were density-dependent. Raptors were the cause of about 70% of winter mortality and they killed about 30% of the grouse present in October. We were unable to determine whether winter mortality in raptors was additive to other losses. 3. Summer losses of adult grouse between April and July averaged 30% and were density-dependent. Raptors were the cause of more than 90% of the early summer mortality of adult grouse. Summer losses of grouse chicks between May and July averaged 45% and were not density-dependent. Harriers killed about 28% of grouse chicks by late July and about 37% by the end of August. Summer raptor predation on adult grouse and chicks appeared to be largely additive to other losses and we estimated that it reduced autumn grouse densities by about 50%. 4. A model combining the estimated reduction in autumn grouse density caused by raptors with the observed density dependence in winter loss predicted that, in the absence of raptors for 2 years, grouse density in spring would be 1.9 times greater, and grouse density in autumn 3.9 times greater, than in the presence of raptors.

Abundance indices of both large and medium size groups exhibit interannual-decadal variations, but their patterns were different. The large and medium size groups of saury are corresponding to the recruitments of winter- and spring-cohort, respectively. The abundance of large size group saury was significantly correlated with the winter sea surface temperature (SST) in the Kuroshio region, whereas the medium size group saury showed high correlations with SST in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone and the Oyashio region, indicating that the two size groups are affected by subtropical and subarctic environment, respectively. Significant negative correlation between the abundance index and the southern oscillation index (SOI) suggested that El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) events have marked impacts on the large size group saury. Subtropical high pressure index and far east zonal index also show high correlations with the abundance of both large and medium size group saury, indicating a linkage between large-scale atmospheric circulation and the abundance of saury.

1933,Effects of forest removal on amphibian migrations: implications for habitat and landscape connectivity,"1. Habitat loss is a leading cause of global amphibian declines. Forest removal is a particularly significant threat because an estimated 82% of amphibians rely on forests for part of their lives. 2. Biphasic amphibians rely on suitable terrestrial habitat to support their post-metamorphic growth and survival and also to maintain appropriate habitat and landscape connectivity. 3. We created 4 replicate, 16-ha experimental arrays in the southeastern USA to examine the effects of forest removal on migratory movements of adult biphasic amphibians. Each array contained four forest-harvesting treatments that included an unharvested control, a partially harvested stand, a clearcut with coarse woody debris retained, and a clearcut with coarse woody debris removed. 4. Some amphibian species emigrated from wetlands in significantly greater numbers through forest controls compared with harvested treatments. Also, salamanders were generally more sensitive to forest removal than were frogs, with a significantly greater proportion of salamanders migrating through forested habitat compared to frogs. 5. For several species, individuals were significantly more likely to avoid clearcuts when emigrating compared to immigrating. Individuals that emigrated into clearcut treatments were more likely to reverse direction and return to wetlands in some species. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our study identifies one mechanism by which forest removal shapes the abundance and distribution of amphibians in terrestrial habitat. To promote the persistence of amphibian populations, conservation efforts should focus on preserving forest habitat adjacent to reproduction sites. Such measures are especially important where forest habitat connects local populations or where it links reproduction sites to other habitat features necessary for amphibian growth, survival, or overwintering.

1338,The decline of Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatus in Alaska: a review of the nutritional stress hypothesis,"1. The decline of Steller sea lions Eumetopias jubatus in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands between the late 1970s and 1990s may have been related to reduced availability of suitable prey. many studies have shown that pinnipeds and other mammals suffering from nutritional stress typically exhibit reduced body size, reduced productivity, high mortality of pups and juveniles, altered blood chemistry and specific behavioural modifications. 2. Morphometric measurements of Steller sea lions through the 1970s and 1980s in Alaska indicate reduced body size. Reduced numbers of pups born and an apparent increase in juvenile mortality rates also appear to be nutritionally based. Blood chemistry analyses have further shown that Steller sea lions in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands area exhibited signs of an acute phase reaction, or immune reaction, in response to unidentified physical and/or environmental stress. Behavioural studies during the 1990s have not noted any changes that are indicative of an overall shortage in the quantity of prey available to lactating female sea lions. 3. The data collected in Alaska are consistent with the hypothesis that Steller sea lions in the declining regions were nutritionally compromised because of the relative quality of prey available to them (chronic nutritional stress), rather than because of the overall quantity of fish per se (acute nutritional stress).

Our objective was to compare number of sightings during whaling and whale watching activities. Our main question to address the possible impact of past whaling in recent whale watching is: does a present-day eco-tourist sight more or fewer sperm whales than a whaler could sight in the past? For that, a compilation of data resulting both from past whaling records and recent whale watching records was conducted. We obtained a total of 727 independent sightings of sperm whales during a total of 280 different days of sperm whaling between 1947 and 1973. A total of 1767 sperm whale sightings were made during 1133 days of whale watching activities, between 1997 and 2008. The sperm whale sighting per unit of effort average was significantly higher in the past (35.68) than in the present (12.06).

2727,"The population dynamics of the longnose skate, Raja rhina, in the northeast Pacific Ocean","The longnose skate, Raja rhina, is the most commonly landed skate species in the northeast Pacific Ocean. It also dominates survey catches in the area. Existing knowledge on skate biology and fisheries suggests that large skate species with late sexual maturation, like the longnose skate, are extremely vulnerable to overfishing, and if overfished they are slow to recover. Historically, in the US Pacific Coast skates have not supported directed fisheries, but have been taken as bycatch in other commercially important fisheries. For the past 13 years, landed catches of skates in waters off Washington, Oregon and California have significantly increased. Using the Stock Synthesis 2 modeling framework, a population model for the longnose skate was developed to assess the current state of the stock and reconstruct its past dynamics. Model results indicate that the longnose skate spawning biomass has slowly declined since 1915; the current stock biomass is estimated as 66% of its unexploited level. Uncertainty in regards to fishery-dependent data and female maturity parameters was explored through sensitivity analyses.

1912,Non-additive effects of density-dependent and density-independent factors on brown trout vital rates,"Interactions between density-dependent and density-independent processes can lead to variation in both growth and survival rates. Detecting such effects, however, will often require sampling on an individual level and at the appropriate spatial and temporal scale. This study documents substantial variation in survival and growth of stream-dwelling brown trout Salmo trutta from a small Norwegian stream. The data is based on seasonal capture-recaptures of individually marked trout on fixed stations during eight years. The fish were small-sized, rarely reaching sizes larger than 20 cm and ages older than seven years. Density varied between 0.2-0.8 fish m-2. Variation in survival and recapture probabilities was analysed using program MARK. Apparent survival (the probability of being alive and present within the study area) generally decreased with increasing trout density and increasing drought level (measured as lowest observed water flow) during both winter and summer. Further, there was a significant interaction effect between density and water flow, indicating that density-dependent effects on survival predominated when environmental conditions were benign (no drought), while density-independent processes were most important under harsh environmental conditions (drought). Observed length-at-age during autumn indicated a more or less linear growth trajectory throughout life, and no effect of density, water flow or temperature was found. However, using the individual-based capture-recapture data to estimated specific growth rate, significant positive effects of water flow and temperature and a negative effect of density were identified. Thus, the capture-recapture data suggest a strong potential for population regulation at the rather low densities found in this stream, and regulation may occur both through effects on survival and growth.",400,Increase,Increase,Varied,Increase,Increase,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,0.0446552348662127,0.00639104193538301,0.0829194277970424,0.0195229061516705,0.0221768497081055,5,Increase,Increase,Non-additive effects of density-dependent and density-independent factors on brown trout vital rates,"Detecting such effects, however, will often require sampling on an individual level and at the appropriate spatial and temporal scale.

1900,Recruitment and survival of immature seabirds in relation to oil spills and climate variability,"1. In long-lived animals with delayed maturity, the non-breeding component of the population may play an important role in buffering the effects of stochastic mortality. Populations of colonial seabirds often consist of more than 50% non-breeders, yet because they spend much of their early life at sea, we understand little about their impact on the demographic process.2. Using multistate capture-mark-recapture techniques, we analyse a long-term data set of individually identifiable common guillemots, Uria aalge Pont., to assess factors influencing their immature survival and two-stage recruitment process.3. Analysis of the distribution of ringed common guillemots during the non-breeding season, separated by age classes, revealed that all age classes were potentially at risk from four major oil spills. However, the youngest age class (0-3 years) were far more widely spread than birds 4-6 years old, which were more widely spread than birds aged 6 and over. Therefore the chance of encountering an oil spill was age-dependent.4. A 2-year compound survival estimate for juvenile guillemots was weakly negatively correlated with winter sea-surface temperature, but was not influenced by oil spills. Non-breeder survival did not vary significantly over time.5. In years following four oil spills, juvenile recruitment was almost double the value in non-oil-spill years.

4485,Seasonal patterns of reproduction and abundance of leaf litter frogs in a Central American rainforest,"Patterns of reproductive phenology and temporal variation in species composition and age structure were investigated for a sample of terrestrial leaf litter frogs from a lowland tropical rainforest in north-eastern Costa Rica. Recruitment of most species showed a seasonal pattern in which the growth of juveniles occurred during the dry season. The phenology of the assemblage was also seasonal, with a peak in abundance during the dry season. Variation in abundance was driven by seasonal patterns of juvenile recruitment in one species, Eleutherodactylus brandsfordii. We suggest that the timing of reproduction and patterns of frog phenology may be tied to the availability of arthropod prey items.

We suggest that the length and severity of dry periods in the Amazon basin limits the ability of terrestrial frogs to reproduce successfully, while in Central America a more benign dry season, while strong enough to create distinct seasonal trends in the phenology of rainforest animals, is not strong enough to prohibit frogs from recruiting juveniles during the dry season.",1498,Varied,Varied,Varied,Varied,Varied,Varied,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,-0.0357855181719371,-0.427778315079948,0.356207278736074,0.2,0.857994558001101,5,Stable,Stable,Seasonal patterns of reproduction and abundance of leaf litter frogs in a Central American rainforest,"Recruitment of most species showed a seasonal pattern in which the growth of juveniles occurred during the dry season.

660,Synchronous variation and long-term trends in two populations of black rat snakes,"Synchronous variation among animal populations affects the vulnerability of endangered species and is relevant to understanding population fluctuation generally. We analyzed data collected over 18 years from two populations of black rat snakes (Elaphe o. obsoleta), a species of conservation concern in Canada, to determine whether the populations varied synchronously. Because the populations were 30 km apart and genetically distinct, synchrony should be attributable to common stochastic environmental factors, the Moran effect. Synchronous variation in annual estimates of population size, survival probability, recruitment, and age structure all provided evidence of a Moran effect. However, opposite trends in age structure through time suggested that the internal dynamics of the two populations were different. The conservation implication of synchrony is that this population of rat snakes is vulnerable to stochastic environmental phenomena because all subpopulations could become rare simultaneously. Evidence of different population processes in the two populations suggests, however, that local factors may be of more immediate relevance to conservation than regional phenomena.

1744,"Biology, fisheries, and conservation of sturgeons and paddlefish in China","This paper reviews five of the eight species of acipenseriforms that occur in China, chiefly those of the Amur and Yangtze rivers. Kaluga Huso dauricus and Amur sturgeon Acipenserschrenckii are endemic to the Amur River. Both species still support fisheries, but stocks are declining due to overfishing. Acipenseriformes of the Yangtze River are primarily threatened by hydroelectric dams that block free passage to spawning and feeding areas. The Chinese paddlefish Psephurus gladius now is rare in the Yangtze River system, and its spawning activities were severely limited by completion of the Gezllouba Dam in 1981. Since 1988, only 3-10 adult paddlefishes per year have been found below the dam. Limited spawning still exists above the dam, but when the new Three Gorges Dam is complete, it will further threaten the paddlefish. Artificial propagation appears to be the only hope for preventing extinction of P. gladius, but it has yet to be successfully bred in captivity. Dabry's sturgeon A. dabryanus is a small, exclusively freshwater sturgeon found only in the Yangtze River system. It is concentrated today in reaches of the main stream above Gezhouba Dam. The fishery has been closed since 1983, but populations continue to decline. Acipenser dabryanus has been cultured since the 1970s, and holds promise for commercial aquaculture; availability of aquacultural methods offers hope for enhancing natural populations. The Chinese sturgeon A. sinensis occurs in the Yangtze and Pearl rivers and seas of east Asia. There is still disagreement about the taxonomy of the Pearl and Yangtze River populations. The Yangtze River population is anadromous. Adults begin spawning at about age 14 years (males) and 21 years (females), and adults spend over 15 months in the river for reproduction. Spawning sites of A. sinensis were found every year since 1982 below the Gezhouba Dam, but it seems that insufficient suitable ground is available for spawning.

Life history characteristics such as delayed maturity result in relatively slow population responses to perturbations, so data should be collected across a relatively long time span. Because differential effects on age classes can be important, studies should also examine potential changes in the population's age structure. Moreover, multiple populations should be studied to indicate whether changes are regional or are restricted to local populations. We incorporated all three factors (long duration, multiple populations, age structure data) into our study of the conservation status of a long-lived aquatic salamander, the hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis. Over the 20 + years of this study, populations of hellbenders declined by an average of about 77%. This decline was characterized by a shift in size (age) structure, with a disproportionate decrease in numbers of young individuals. The change in density and age structure was consistent for populations in five rivers and for two subspecies (C. a. alleganiensis and C. a. bishopi), indicating that the decline is not restricted to one or two local populations. For the population with the most extensive data, the decline had clearly begun by the 1980s and there was a significant decrease in body condition over the period of the study.

The numerical and functional responses of colonizing wolves in Yellowstone's prey-rich environment were higher than expected and close to the maximum rates predicted prior to wolf restoration. Counts of northern Yellowstone elk (Cervus elaphus) decreased more (50%) than predicted (5-30%), and will likely continue to decrease given the strong preference of wolves for elk and continued high kill rates despite this substantial reduction in elk abundance. Contrary to expectations, human harvests were not reduced appreciably concurrent with wolf restoration, but instead remained similar to pre-wolf restoration years. However, antler-less permits were gradually reduced by 51% during 2000-2004 and additional reductions may be necessary while wolf densities remain high. There have been no substantial effects of wolf recovery on other ungulate species (bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), bison (Bison bison), moose (Alces alces), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana)). However, wolf recovery may eventually contribute to increased bison and pronghorn abundance by decreasing elk and coyote abundance, respectively. Wolf recovery may also contribute to more-pronounced spatial structuring of sex/age classes of northern Yellowstone elk through changes in their distribution, migration, and age structure.

545,Past and distant whaling and the rapid decline of sperm whales off the Galapagos Islands.,"It is generally expected that exploited whale populations should rebuild following the end of whaling. Using photographic identification of individuals during a series of field projects, we studied female and immature sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) that visit the waters off the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Analysis of mark-recapture data, using a likelihood model, indicates the population decreased at a rate of about 20% per year (95% c.i. 7-32%) between 1985-1995. During the study period the animals were not hunted and were not obviously the subject of other immediate anthropogenic threats. Rates at which research vessels encountered whales also fell over this interval The decline seems to be due principally to migration into waters off the Central and South American mainland. The population also has a very low recruitment rate, about 0.05 calves/female/year, as indicated by rates of observation of calves. Although other causes, cannot be ruled out, both the high emigration rate and low recruitment rate are probably related to heavy whaling in Peruvian waters which ended in 1981. Whales from the Galapagos are moving east to fill productive but depopulated waters near the coast, and the virtual elimination of large breeding males (in their late twenties and older) from the region has lowered pregnancy rates.

2011,Impacts of the Brown Tree Snake: Patterns of Decline and Species Persistence in Guam’s Avifauna,"Predation by brown tree snakes (Boiga irregularis) devastated the avifauna of Guam in the Mariana Islands during the last half of the twentieth century, causing the extirpation or serious reduction of most of the island's 25 resident bird species. Past studies have provided qualitative descriptions of the decline of native forest birds but have not considered all species or presented quantitative analyses. We analyzed two sets of survey data gathered in northern Guam between 1976 and 1998 and reviewed unpublished sources to provide a comprehensive account of the impact of brown tree snakes on the island's birds. Our results indicate that 22 species, including 17 of 18 native species, were severely affected by snakes. Twelve species were likely extirpated as breeding residents on the main island, 8 others experienced declines of ≥90% throughout the island or at least in the north, and 2 were kept at reduced population levels during all or much of the study. Declines of ≥90% occurred rapidly, averaging just 8.9 years along three roadside survey routes combined and 1.6 years at a 100-ha forested study site. Declines in northern Guam were also relatively synchronous and occurred from about 1976 to 1986 for most species. The most important factor predisposing a species to coexistence with brown tree snakes was its ability to nest and roost at locations where snakes were uncommon. Large clutch size and large body size were also related to longer persistence times, although large body size appeared to delay, but not prevent, extirpation. Our results draw attention to the enormous detrimental impact that brown tree snakes are likely to have upon invading new areas.

4062,Cost-effective abundance estimation of rare animals: Testing performance of small-boat surveys for killer whales in British Columbia,"Top predators are often rare, subject to anthropogenic mortality, and possess life-history traits that make them inherently vulnerable to extinction. IUCN criteria recognise populations as Critically Endangered when abundance is <250 mature individuals, but estimating abundance of rare species can be more challenging than for common ones.

3076,"Analyzing variability and the rate of decline of migratory shorebirds in Moreton Bay, Australia","Estimating the abundance of migratory species is difficult because sources of variability differ substantially among species and populations. Recently developed state-space models address this variability issue by directly modeling both environmental and measurement error, although their efficacy in detecting declines is relatively untested for empirical data. We applied state-space modeling, generalized least squares (with autoregression error structure), and standard linear regression to data on abundance of wetland birds (shorebirds and terns) at Moreton Bay in southeast Queensland, Australia. There are internationally significant numbers of 8 species of waterbirds in the bay, and it is a major terminus of the large East Asian-Australasian Flyway. In our analyses, we considered 22 migrant and 8 resident species. State-space models identified abundances of 7 species of migrants as significantly declining and abundance of one species as significantly increasing. Declines in migrant abundance over 15 years were 43-79%. Generalized least squares with an autoregressive error structure showed abundance changes in 11 species, and standard linear regression showed abundance changes in 15 species. The higher power of the regression models meant they detected more declines, but they also were associated with a higher rate of false detections. If the declines in Moreton Bay are consistent with trends from other sites across the flyway as a whole, then a large number of species are in significant decline.

1246,Adélie penguin population change in the pacific sector of Antarctica: relation to sea-ice extent and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.,"One of the longest continuing data Sets involving a marine organism in the Antarctic is that of annual estimates of breeding population size of Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae at colonies on Ross Island, Ross Sea, 1959 to 1997. The sizes of these colonies have displayed significant interannual variability during the 29-yr period. We hypothesized that changes are related to natural environmental factors; and used path analysis to analyze annual variation in population growth in relation to physical environmental factors during that part of the record with comparable sea-ice satellite imagery from 1973 to 1997. The Ross Sea sector of the Southern Ocean lying north of Ross Island, from 150°E to 130°W, comprised our study area. Annual population growth measured during summer was explained best, and inversely, by the extent of sea-ice in the study area 5 winters earlier, and in some way related to the Southern Oscillation. Analysis of a subset of the sea-ice data from 1979 to 1997 indicated strong correlations to ice conditions in the eastern portion of the study area (174 to 130°W), and virtually no correlations to the western half (150°E to 175°W). This result supported other indirect evidence that the Ross Island penguins winter in the eastern Ross Sea/western Amundsen Sea. A demographic model indicated that variation in survival of juveniles and subadults might account for the observed population variation, and would also explain the 5-yr lag as 5 yr is the average age of recruitment to the summer breeding population. Extensive sea-ice during winter appears to reduce subadult survival, expressed subsequently when these cohorts reach maturation. We hypothesize that extensive (more northerly) sea-ice limits access of penguins to productive waters known to occur south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, with starvation or increased predation disproportionately affecting less-experienced birds.

Based on these results we propose a new monitoring method for the huemul and discuss the importance of estimating accuracies of historical survey data to ensure that changes in the abundance of the species reflect real population trends and are not an artefact of variation over time in the accuracy of survey data.

A total of 7,563 Bewick's Swans were counted in Britain and Ireland during January 1995, 7,597 in January 2000 and 7,216 in January 2005, representing a 4.6% decrease in numbers between 1995 and 2005.

Eastern England consistently held the largest concentrations of Bewick's Swans in Britain and Ireland, increasing by 7% between 1995 and 2005. Southeast England also saw an increase in numbers, supporting the possibility of an eastward contraction of range. The percentage of cygnets recorded in flocks in Britain and Ireland was 11.5% during January 1995, 7.6% in January 2000 and 14.4% in January 2005; mean brood size was similar in these years, ranging between 1.97 and 1.98 cygnets per successful pair.

3981,"The El Niño Southern Oscillation, Variable Fruit Production, and Famine in a Tropical Forest","We tested the hypothesis that the El Nifio Southern Oscillation influences forest-wide fruit production, which, in turn, limits frugivorous and granivorous mammals on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Observations of BCI mammals have been com- piled for 49 years. Frugivorous mammals experienced famine between September and January in 1931-1932, 1958-1959, 1970-1971, and 1993-1994. The most recent famine is evident from an 1 1-yr record of natural deaths of mammals and a 2-yr record of population densities. Famine occurred every time a mild dry season followed an El Ninio event in the 49-yr record. This coincidence is statistically improbable, as demonstrated by a random- ization test. A 2-yr cycle of high, then low community-level fruit production has been observed twice for BCI when a mild dry season followed an El Nifio event. We used 260 litter traps to monitor community- and species-level fruit production from 1 January 1987 through 30 June 1996. Community-level fruit production was greatest during the 1992 El Nifio event and lowest one year later, after the mild 1993 dry season. We also reinterpret an earlier 2-yr record of fruit production in light of our 9.5-yr record of fruit production. Community- level fruit production was elevated during the 1969 El Niiio event and was very low one year later, after the mild 1970 dry season. We hypothesize that (1) El Nifio conditions enhance fruit production; (2) high fruit production consumes stored reserves, limiting the next reproductive event; and (3) mild dry seasons reduce fruit production. Each plant species may respond to any combination of the three components of this hypothesis. Community- level fruit production is extremely low when species sensitive to components 1 and 2 are entrained with species sensitive to component 3, or when a mild dry season follows one year after an El Niflo event. El Niiio events bring dry, sunny conditions to BCI and a large portion of the wet tropics. Drought and sun may both favor fruit production in wet tropical forests. Drought is known to synchronize flowering, and sunny conditions may relieve light limitation. The El Niiio Southern Oscillation has a strong 24-mo periodicity. This creates a strong tendency for dry, sunny years to alternate with wet, cloudy years in Central America and elsewhere in the tropics. We present evidence that this alternately enhances and reduces fruit production on BCI. Terborgh hypothesized that predators regulate frugivorous mammals in tropical forests. As a corollary, he further hypothesized that famines occur on BCI because several large predators are absent and frugivores escape predation. We extended censuses to the nearby mainland to evaluate this hypothesis. Poachers, who are active on the mainland, reduce the abundances of game species below levels maintained in the presence of large felids and raptors. There was evidence for famine in poached, mainland populations, and we rejected the hypothesis that reduced predation pressure is a prerequisite for famine.",1258,Decline,Varied,Varied,Decline,Decline,Decline,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,-0.118300244259771,-0.3954810091297071,0.158880520610164,0.141421356237309,0.40286858801735603,10,Stable,Stable,"The El Niño Southern Oscillation, Variable Fruit Production, and Famine in a Tropical Forest","Observations of BCI mammals have been com- piled for 49 years.

Famine occurred every time a mild dry season followed an El Ninio event in the 49-yr record. This coincidence is statistically improbable, as demonstrated by a random- ization test. A 2-yr cycle of high, then low community-level fruit production has been observed twice for BCI when a mild dry season followed an El Nifio event. We used 260 litter traps to monitor community- and species-level fruit production from 1 January 1987 through 30 June 1996. Community-level fruit production was greatest during the 1992 El Nifio event and lowest one year later, after the mild 1993 dry season. We also reinterpret an earlier 2-yr record of fruit production in light of our 9.5-yr record of fruit production. Community- level fruit production was elevated during the 1969 El Niiio event and was very low one year later, after the mild 1970 dry season. We hypothesize that (1) El Nifio conditions enhance fruit production; (2) high fruit production consumes stored reserves, limiting the next reproductive event; and (3) mild dry seasons reduce fruit production. Each plant species may respond to any combination of the three components of this hypothesis. Community- level fruit production is extremely low when species sensitive to components 1 and 2 are entrained with species sensitive to component 3, or when a mild dry season follows one year after an El Niflo event. El Niiio events bring dry, sunny conditions to BCI and a large portion of the wet tropics. Drought and sun may both favor fruit production in wet tropical forests. Drought is known to synchronize flowering, and sunny conditions may relieve light limitation. The El Niiio Southern Oscillation has a strong 24-mo periodicity. This creates a strong tendency for dry, sunny years to alternate with wet, cloudy years in Central America and elsewhere in the tropics. We present evidence that this alternately enhances and reduces fruit production on BCI. Terborgh hypothesized that predators regulate frugivorous mammals in tropical forests. As a corollary, he further hypothesized that famines occur on BCI because several large predators are absent and frugivores escape predation. We extended censuses to the nearby mainland to evaluate this hypothesis. Poachers, who are active on the mainland, reduce the abundances of game species below levels maintained in the presence of large felids and raptors.",nia southern oscillation variable fruit production famine tropical forest observations bci mammals com piled years frugivorous mammals experienced famine september january recent famine evident record natural deaths mammals record population densities famine occurred time mild dry season followed ninio event record coincidence statistically improbable demonstrated random ization test cycle high low community level fruit production observed twice bci mild dry season followed nifio event litter traps monitor community species level fruit production january june community level fruit production greatest nifio event lowest year later mild dry season reinterpret earlier record fruit production light record fruit production community level fruit production elevated niiio event low year later mild dry season hypothesize nifio conditions enhance fruit production high fruit production consumes stored reserves limiting reproductive event mild dry seasons reduce fruit production plant species respond combination components hypothesis community level fruit production extremely low species sensitive components entrained species sensitive component mild dry season follows year niflo event niiio events bring dry sunny conditions bci large portion wet tropics drought sun favor fruit production wet tropical forests drought known synchronize flowering sunny conditions relieve light limitation niiio southern oscillation strong periodicity creates strong tendency dry sunny years alternate wet cloudy years central america tropics present evidence alternately enhances reduces fruit production bci terborgh hypothesized predators regulate frugivorous mammals tropical forests corollary hypothesized famines occur bci large predators absent frugivores escape predation extended censuses nearby mainland evaluate hypothesis poachers active mainland reduce abundances game species levels maintained presence large felids raptors,Increase,Stable,Stable,Increase,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable,Stable

4612,"Temporal variability in fish assemblage structure and recruitment in a freshwater-deprived estuary: The Coorong, Australia","River regulation can diminish freshwater flows to estuaries and compromise estuarine functionality. Understanding biotic responses to altered flow regimes is imperative to effectively manage aquatic ecosystems. The present study investigated temporal variation in fish assemblage structure and the recruitment of catadromous fish in the Coorong estuary at the terminus of the Murray River, in south-eastern Australia. Over the three-year study period, freshwater inflows to the estuary diminished and ultimately ceased, disconnecting freshwater and estuarine environments. It was hypothesised that these conditions would lead to (1) increases in estuarine salinities and concomitant changes in fish assemblage structure and abundance, and (2) decreased recruitment of catadromous fish. As freshwater inflow decreased, salinities immediately downstream of a series of tidal barrages increased from brackish to marinehypersaline, species richness and diversity decreased, freshwater and diadromous species became less abundant and assemblages were increasingly characterised by marine species. Furthermore, the abundance of young-of-year catadromous fish decreased dramatically. Excessive regulation of freshwater inflows is resulting in the Coorong estuary resembling a marine embayment, leading to a loss in species diversity. We suggest, however, that even small volumes of freshwater may promote diversity in estuarine fish assemblages and some recruitment of catadromous species.

3086,Rapid and continued population decline in the Spoon-billed Sandpiper Eurynorhynchus pygmeus indicates imminent extinction unless conservation action is taken,"The Spoon-billed Sandpiper Eurynorhynchus pygmeus (IUCN Category: Critically Endangered) is in rapid decline. Data from across the entire breeding range (Chukotka and Koryakya in the Russian far north-east) and especially from the well-studied southern core breeding area at Meinypilgyno, confirm the continuing strong decline. At four breeding sites, where more than two counts were available for analysis, the decline was estimated at 26% per annum between 2002 and 2009, or an 88% decline over this period. Allowing for unsurveyed areas, this equates to a decline from a total population of approximately 1,000 breeding pairs in 2000 to 120-220 in 2009. Breeding studies at Meinypilgyno in 2003-2007 (not 2006) showed that the proportion of nests hatching at least one chick was 0.65 and once chicks left the nest, the mean brood size of chicks up to one week old was 1.99. Where it was possible to follow broods, 0.61 chicks fledged per nesting attempt. Survival and recruitment analysis of birds ringed at Meinypilgyno indicated that annual adult survival did not significantly differ over the 2003-2009 study but that recruitment in to the adult breeding population was effectively zero in all but one year of the study (2005). Resighting data for the last two years of the study were sparse due to very low numbers of marked adults being recorded and survival rates over the last 2-3 years of the study must therefore be treated with caution. The analysis therefore indicated that after fledging, survival during immaturity must be very low, leading to a low (or no) recruitment into an ageing population. Recent observations collated from the non-breeding areas confirm the declining trend observed in the breeding areas and imply that the main threats to the population lie along the migration route or in the wintering areas. These are poorly known although hunting in the wintering areas has been identified as a major mortality factor. Other threats include major loss of their intertidal habitats, and collection of birds on the breeding areas by specimen collectors. Improved monitoring in both the breeding and non-breeding areas as well as research on juvenile survival is recommended. Concerted international conservation action is essential if this species is to avoid extinction. This requires (i) improved understanding of the main wintering and staging areas and associated threats; (ii) addressing those threats that can be tackled with immediate effect, such as hunting; (iii) continued long-term monitoring on the breeding areas; (iv) an exploration of other potential breeding areas; (v) conservation action at all important stop-over and wintering sites along the entire flyway and (vi) consideration of a captive-breeding programme to ensure the survival of this species.
